# Website Redesign Strategy & Content Map

**Date:** September 17, 2025

**Objective:** To pivot the Luminous BioSolutions website from a general informational site to an authoritative resource hub designed to engage and validate for specific expert personas (Scientists, Regulators, Operators).

---

## 1. Core Strategic Shift: Authority over Automation

The guiding principle is to establish scientific and technical credibility. The website will serve as the central hub for high-value technical content, moving away from a simple marketing brochure.

## 2. New Sitemap & Persona-Based Journeys

**Homepage:**
*   **Headline:** "The Data Layer for Verifiable Reclamation."
*   **Primary CTA:** Visually distinct paths for "Scientists," "Regulators," and "Operators."
*   **Content:** Feature a primary resource (e.g., a technical white paper) and logos/links to peer-reviewed publications.

**Solutions for Scientists & Researchers:**
*   **Purpose:** Prove scientific validity.
*   **Content:** Deep dive into biosensor technology, link to ACS SynBio paper, display validation data (correlation plots, dose-response curves), and use technical language.
*   **CTA:** "Access Our Publications."

**Solutions for Regulators & Policy Makers:**
*   **Purpose:** Build trust through transparency and data integrity.
*   **Content:** Focus on the Confluent Data Platform. Feature mockups of the dashboard, and emphasize auditable data trails and compliance.
*   **CTA:** "Download our Technical Brief on Data-Driven Compliance."

**Solutions for Operators & Engineers:**
*   **Purpose:** Make the business and operational case.
*   **Content:** Focus on operational value (speed, throughput). Frame the Kearl Wetland project as a case study. Shift the conversation from "cost-per-sample" to the "value of real-time intelligence."
*   **CTA:** "Read Our Kearl Wetland Case Study."

**Resource Hub:**
*   **Purpose:** A central library for all technical content to generate leads.
*   **Content:** Gated white papers, links to publications, webinar recordings.

## 3. Key Content & Messaging Frameworks

### Operator Value Proposition (Reframing Cost)
*   **Shift from:** "Cost-per-sample."
*   **Shift to:** The value of a predictable subscription for unlimited operational monitoring.
*   **Narrative:** Contrast the "Old Paradigm" (unpredictable lab costs, decisions on old data) with the "New Paradigm" (predictable fee, real-time intelligence, optimized processes, de-risked timelines).

### Regulator Dashboard (Conceptual Wireframe)
*   A conceptual graphic will be created for the website, detailing key modules:
    1.  **Geospatial Compliance Map** (Color-coded site status).
    2.  **Key Parameter Trends** (NA concentration over time).
    3.  **Compliance Status Panel** (At-a-glance overview).
    4.  **Data Export Button** ("Export AER-Compliant Dataset").
    5.  **Auditable Event Log**.

### Scientific Visuals
*   The "For Scientists" page will feature data visualizations to establish credibility:
    1.  **Correlation Plots** (Biosensor vs. HRMS).
    2.  **Dose-Response Curves** (Quantitative reliability).
    3.  **Specificity Heatmaps** (Panel capabilities).
    4.  **Agar Plate Images** (Intuitive technology visualization).

### Kearl Wetland Case Study Structure
*   The case study will be drafted following this narrative:
    1.  **The Challenge:** Detail the specific monitoring limitations of the original study (e.g., 10-15 day data lag).
    2.  **The Luminous Intervention:** Describe the deployment of the biosensors (e.g., daily sampling, 24-hour turnaround).
    3.  **The Data & Results:** Present the correlation data and time-series graphs.
    4.  **The Operational Benefit:** Highlight the unique insights gained from high-frequency data (e.g., identifying the mid-season slowdown in degradation rate).
