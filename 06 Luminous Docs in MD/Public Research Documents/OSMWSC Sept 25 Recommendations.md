## Recommendation: Alternative oil sands mine water treatment technologies

Oil sands mining operations store vast amounts of oil sands mine water (OSMW) in tailings ponds, including over 1.5 billion cubic metres of fluid tailings and 400 million cubic metres of mine water. While operators have traditionally used water recycling to reduce the requirement to withdraw additional water from the watershed, extensive recycling has increased OSMW salinity to the point where treatment options are becoming a challenge.

Treatment technologies for OSMW are in various development stages, with significant research and development (R&D) underway, especially in Alberta. Those at the latter stages of the technology readiness level scale (pilots, commercial demonstration) are essential to evaluate the effectiveness, reliability and scalability of these technologies. These projects provide data for informed decisions on new technology adoption and implementation.

### Recommendation

The Government of Alberta continue to work with the oil sands industry, technology providers and research organizations to develop and conduct pilots on promising active and passive OSMW treatment technologies.

### Rationale for the Recommendation

The committee heard from numerous technology developers who are exploring innovative ways to manage water on site. OSMW treatment technologies are at various stages of development and ongoing R&D efforts continue. By collaborating with research organizations and the oil sands industry, the Government of Alberta should emphasize harnessing local expertise to develop innovative, tailored solutions that meet regulatory standards. Incentives can accelerate technology adoption and scale up, fostering sustainable water management practices while driving economic growth, job creation and innovation within Alberta.

Investing in pilot projects for active and passive OSMW treatments is critical to assessing their effectiveness, reliability and scalability under real world conditions. Gap analyses can further refine these efforts by identifying areas for improvement and guiding investments toward the most promising technologies. Transparency and public engagement during pilots are essential for building trust, addressing concerns, and showcasing positive environmental impacts. This holistic approach tackles immediate challenges while promoting long-term sustainability and public confidence.

Operators should strive to share the relevant information about the technologies they are piloting with the Indigenous communities, public and stakeholders to ensure awareness and build trust.

### Feasibility of Alternative Technologies

Alternative technologies need to be carefully evaluated against multiple feasibility criteria such as the following.

#### Policy and Regulatory Alignment

The adoption of alternative technologies in managing oil sands mine water is heavily influenced by existing policy and regulatory frameworks. The timeline for obtaining necessary permits and approvals to implement alternative technologies should be considered in the development of alternative technologies with forward thinking strategies around how promising new technologies can be quickly deployed based on regulatory requirements.

#### Environmental Impacts

The environmental benefits of alternative technologies can serve as a compelling argument for their adoption, provided they demonstrate tangible evidence in addressing the issue of accumulating OSMW on site. Continuous monitoring and assessment are essential to ensure that these technologies do not introduce new environmental risks.

#### Indigenous Perspective

Meaningful participation involves creating space for Indigenous communities to actively engage in end-to-end technology deployment decision-making processes, ensuring their voices, experiences and opinions are heard and valued, particularly in shaping policies and actions for future generations.

Prior to regulatory approval by the Alberta Energy Regulator, oil sands operators are responsible for communicating and engaging with Indigenous communities on the plans for deployment of a proposed technology. While communities have the opportunity to voice concerns regarding the technology and plans for deployment during regulatory application/amendment processes, proactive engagement with communities is strongly encouraged.

#### Public Perception

Albertans who are potentially affected by OSMW management, particularly those in the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo, should be provided opportunity for meaningful participation in technology development and deployment. Effective communication and engagement strategies are essential to inform the public about the progress on the development of new technologies, as well as the benefits and potential challenges, and highlighting opportunities for public involvement.

Addressing public concerns and highlighting success stories can build confidence and support for technological innovations.

#### Economic Feasibility and Technology Viability

To be successful, alternative technologies will need to be cost-effective while meeting regulatory requirements. The initial capital expenditure, operational costs and potential financial incentives must be fully understood and carefully evaluated based on site specifications. Innovations that reduce long-term operational costs, enhance efficiency and minimize liabilities associated with environmental damage are more likely to be economically viable.

Technologies must be capable of accelerating the management of accumulating OSMW on site, while minimizing additional impacts that may occur (e.g., energy demands, greenhouse gas emissions, waste generation). R&D efforts are essential to refine and optimize new technologies, ensuring they are effective, reliable, adaptable and scalable under varying geographic and climate conditions. Pilot projects and field trials can provide valuable data and insights, helping to demonstrate the practical applicability and benefits of innovative solutions.

### Implementation Considerations

Managing accumulating OSMW is a critical challenge for oil sands operations. Alternative technologies offer promising avenues to accelerate the timeline for management of accumulating OSMW volumes. Each technology presents its own advantages and challenges, necessitating a comprehensive evaluation of feasibility, cost and environmental impact for successful implementation, through:

• **Lifecycle assessment:** Conducting a lifecycle assessment on alternative technologies, including cost-benefit and greenhouse gas emissions analyses.

• **Adaptation of current communication modes:** Leveraging existing communication modes to enhance information sharing and bringing awareness on current R&D initiatives, plans moving forward, and opportunities for interested parties, including Indigenous communities, to be aware of opportunities for engagement in the process.

By adopting innovative approaches and the use of alternative technologies, the oil sands industry can accelerate the management of OSMW accumulation on site, minimize future accumulation, and advance towards reclamation.

## Recommendation: Treatment and release of oil sands mine water

Treatment and release involves treating oil sands mine water (OSMW) to a quality that meets or exceeds yet to be developed regulatory standards before discharging it as treated effluent into natural water bodies, such as the Athabasca River.

Currently, operators store process-affected water primarily in tailings ponds, as releases of treated process affected water have historically been prohibited. These large, engineered structures, typically a series of dykes and dams, contain water used in the bitumen extraction process. According to the Alberta Energy Regulator, tailings ponds had accumulated over 1.36 billion cubic metres of fluids as of 2023. The ongoing accumulation of OSMW poses significant storage and environmental challenges. Establishing release standards for treated OSMW will allow operators to manage increasing water volumes on site and achieve mine closure outcomes in accordance with their tailings management and reclamation plans and will improve the accuracy of financial liability calculations associated with oil sands mines.

Long term maintenance of large volumes of process-affected water in tailings ponds creates a risk of engineered structure failures and accidental releases of untreated OSMW, threatening wildlife, aquatic ecosystems and downstream users. Over the past decades, industry has heavily relied on recycling process-affected water to manage OSMW. However, while this approach supports water conservation, it has created additional challenges. As water is repeatedly recycled, the concentration of dissolved salts, metals, hydrocarbons and other contaminants in tailings ponds increases, making the OSMW more difficult to reuse or treat to meet yet to be defined release standards.

### Recommendation

The Steering Committee recommends the following to optimize the management and release of treated OSMW:

Government of Alberta expedite the establishment of release standards* for treated OSMW building on existing processes used for other industries, while acknowledging that oil sands mining has challenges that may require supplemental guidance and requirements.

Treatment and release to the environment (e.g. direct to the Athabasca, other water bodies, end pit lakes, etc.) is essential to mitigate the risks associated with the accumulating OSMW on site. Establishing water quality release standards with a sense of urgency is crucial, as it impacts all other aspects of the OSMW management strategy, including end pit lake design, reclamation plans, and advancements in OSMW treatment technologies. Utilizing adaptive management principles will allow necessary adjustments to release standards, should monitoring results demonstrate that initial release standards may require updating to achieve desired water and environmental health objectives.

Furthermore, it is crucial for the Government of Alberta to work with the federal government, Indigenous and local communities, and industry stakeholders in establishing appropriate standards for water release back into the watershed. This collaborative approach ensures that diverse perspectives and expertise are integrated into the regulatory framework, promoting transparency, trust, and shared responsibility in environmental management.

*Release standards: A set of criteria, procedures or principles used to determine end-of-pipe or in-river limits for discharge to the environment, for single or cumulative release scenarios.

### Rationale for the Recommendation

The rationale for treatment and release of OSMW in Alberta has been assessed against multiple dimensions of feasibility as follows.

#### Policy and Regulatory Alignment

Release of treated OSMW requires clear legislative and policy frameworks at both the provincial and federal levels. Alberta's Environmental Protection and Enhancement Act serves as the primary provincial legislation governing the authorization of substance releases to the environment. Specifically pertaining to effluent releases, the Industrial Release Limits Policy (2000) and Water Quality-Based Effluent Procedures Manual (1995) provide policy guidance and direction on industrial releases. Future releases of OSMW to the environment would follow this long-standing policy applicable to several other industries in Alberta. However, due to the unique attributes of OSMW and the density of potential cumulative releases within a small area, further guidance and supplementary requirements may need to be developed prior to any OSMW releases.

At the federal level, effluent regulations under the Fisheries Act set standards to protect Canada's fisheries resources, covering sectors such as municipal wastewater, pulp and paper, metal and diamond mining, and petroleum refining. Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) is considering developing regulations for oil sands mine effluent, potentially taking a different approach than with previous regulations. A recent discussion paper released by the Crown Indigenous Working Group (CIWG), which includes ECCC participation, outlines a process to evaluate the necessity of regulations when considering various potential alternatives for managing treated OSMW. The overarching goal for CIWG is to inform recommendations to the ECCC Minister based on a thorough evaluation of all mine water management options.

ECCC's presentation to the Steering Committee highlighted that CIWG's alternatives assessment will inform potential regulations, including both the consideration of alternative management strategies as well as standards for authorized release.

To minimize the complexities and inefficiencies that may arise from having two different regulatory processes with potentially conflicting outcomes, the Steering Committee encourages Alberta to work with the Government of Canada. This cooperation will help ensure coherence and alignment of regulatory requirements that provide clear, consistent and effective standards for the release of treated OSMW.

#### Environmental Impact

All discharges from industrial sites must prioritize safeguarding the environment and human health, and this includes the release of water from oil sands. The primary concern should be whether the treated mine water is safe for fish, their habitats, human health, and traditional land uses. Once safety is confirmed, attention should shift to monitoring processes to ensure that these standards are consistently met.

Additionally, in its submission to the Steering Committee, Pathways Alliance noted that the potential environmental impacts from treatment, such as waste production and energy use, depend significantly on the technology employed to meet release criteria. The Pathways Alliance also noted that to fully enable the closure of mine sites at the end of their operational life, these sites will need to be reconnected to the environment.

#### Indigenous Perspective

Many Indigenous communities oppose treated OSMW release. According to an ECCC presentation to the Steering Committee, Indigenous communities are concerned about cumulative effects, impacts on aquatic habitat, human health, and Indigenous rights. Addressing historical and ongoing effects of oil sands development on Indigenous communities is crucial, as many have reported ecological degradation, loss of traditional land use areas, and social and health challenges.

In a submission to the Steering Committee, one Indigenous community articulated that the focus should not be solely on wastewater treatment. Instead, a holistic approach is necessary, encompassing all aspects of reclamation and closure. This perspective underscores the interconnectedness of environmental, social and cultural factors in the management of oil sands impacts. By adopting a comprehensive approach, it is possible to address the full spectrum of issues related to oil sands development, ensuring that the measures taken are effective and respectful of Indigenous knowledge and rights.

#### Public Perception

Environmental concerns are at the forefront of public perception regarding the oil sands, including release of treated OSMW. Public apprehension about environmental impacts emphasizes the need for rigorous evidence of compliance of still to be developed water quality release standards. Transparency in decision-making and open communication are vital for building public confidence. A study on public perception of OSMW treatment programs found that 88 percent of Albertans prioritize water quality for treated OSMW over reclamation times or payment/compensation. Albertans deem water quality as the most valuable attribute when selecting reclamation strategies. Providing clear, evidence-based information about treatment effectiveness and safety is crucial for addressing these concerns.

#### Economic Feasibility and Technology Viability

Cost assessments and economic feasibility of treatment technologies must be evaluated based on the best fit for operations. According to the Council of Canadian Academies, technology adoption in the oil sands industry is influenced by resource quality, oil prices, investment scale, development time, and policy factors.

In Pathways Alliance's submission to the Steering Committee, it was emphasized that once the requirements for water release are clearly defined, operators have the flexibility to select an appropriate treatment technology or a combination of technologies to ensure compliance with these criteria. This approach allows operators to tailor their water treatment processes to meet specific regulatory requirements and environmental standards, ensuring that the treated water released into the environment is safe and meets the established guidelines.

### Implementation Considerations

Implementing the treatment and release of OSMW involves several critical considerations to ensure its success and sustainability.

**Improve Technology Adoption:** Continued research and development to accelerate technology adoption and setting clear regulatory guidelines and performance standards will also drive technology adoption. For their part, governments can develop a more complete regulatory regime that provides clarity on the direction of future water treatment standards. More generally, this requires creating the conditions for a healthy and dynamic innovation ecosystem.

**Federal-Provincial Coordination:** Collaborative efforts between the Government of Alberta and the federal government are necessary to align regulatory processes that establish stringent environmental guidelines while also being feasible for industrial application. This collaboration will enable the development of release standards/regulations for OSMW that are aligned and consistent with the release standards currently applied to other industrial sectors.

**Optimize Recycling of OSMW:** Recycling has resulted in OSMW that is high in salts which may require costly and energy intensive treatment methods to treat prior to release back to the environment. Once release standards are developed industry should consider a water recycling strategy that promotes optimal water conservation and usage across mining operations, with consideration for viable water treatment options.

**Regional Land Use Planning:** When establishing water quality release standards for treat and release, the Government of Alberta should consider linkages to the Surface Water Quality Management Framework under the Lower Athabasca Regional Plan and the water quality triggers and limits that have been established.

**Supplemental Guidance:** Oil sands mining has unique challenges such as, but not limited to, density of operations, mine water accumulation, salinity and public profile. Therefore, developing supplemental guidance, consistent with direction provided in the Tailings Management Framework for the Mineable Athabasca Oil Sands, on certain aspects such as enhanced wastewater characterization, water treatment performance standards, additional guidelines for release, river water quality modelling, enhanced monitoring and assessment of risks to human and ecological health may be required. These supplementary requirements will ensure effective water and tailings management through transparent processes, stakeholder involvement, and environmental protections, contributing to public trust and informed decision-making.

These recommendations aim to accelerate the management of OSMW, promoting practices that align with environmental protection, regulatory compliance, and engagement with Indigenous communities and the public. Only through rigorous implementation, will these strategies ensure sustainable development and restore trust with Indigenous communities, stakeholders and the public.

## Recommendation: Advancing end pit lakes

End pit lakes (EPLs) are a critical element in mine closure and reclamation strategies within Alberta's oil sands industry. These engineered water bodies are designed to transform the final voids left by open-pit mines into sustainable ecosystems that support aquatic life and contribute to reclamation of oil sands mines.

• **End pit lakes without tailings:** The Government of Alberta and industry have recognized EPLs without tailings as an important component of mine closure plans. End pit lakes without tailings are permitted in Alberta, provided they meet conditions set by the government. Existing EPLs without tailings, both within and outside of Alberta, have demonstrated the ability to become ecologically viable aquatic ecosystems.

• **End pit lakes with treated tailings:** EPLs with treated tailings, referred to as water-capped tailings, are still under consideration as permanent closure features. Full-scale EPL demonstration projects are underway to examine whether EPLs with treated tailings can develop into a self-sustaining, boreal forest aquatic ecosystem.

While EPLs present an avenue for mine closure and reclamation in Alberta's oil sands industry, their successful implementation requires careful consideration of environmental, regulatory and social factors. The Government of Alberta, industry and other key stakeholders must continue to innovate and work with Indigenous communities to develop and refine EPL strategies that can achieve mine reclamation outcomes with effective tailings management, ultimately contributing to sustainable resource development and environmental stewardship.

### Recommendation

The Steering Committee proposes the following recommendation to determine the viability of EPLs with treated tailings:

Building on ongoing research and development and working with Indigenous communities, industry and other stakeholders, the Government of Alberta should establish criteria that EPLs with treated tailings must meet at the individual and landscape levels.

Conducting further research and development (R&D) to assess the nature and complexities of EPLs with treated tailings will help determine the feasibility of EPLs as an option to manage fluid tailings volumes and the water released from treated tailings. Further R&D is also required to fully understand the quality and amount of OSMW that could be used to fill the EPL. The findings from R&D and key lessons learned from existing demonstration EPLs need to be incorporated into future EPL designs, so that EPLs can integrate seamlessly into a healthy ecosystem, supporting biodiversity and ecological function while requiring minimal maintenance and management. Furthermore, the design and implementation of EPLs with treated tailings and OSMW should be carried out in a manner that is transparent and acceptable to the public, ensuring community support and compliance with environmental standards.

Involvement of local and Indigenous communities will be vital for the successful implementation and acceptance of EPLs. Local Indigenous communities are primary users of the land and have valuable knowledge and insights that can inform research on the design and management of EPLs, towards making them culturally and environmentally appropriate. A collaborative approach to EPL placement, density and individual design can foster trust and enhance transparency, in a manner that addresses the concerns and priorities of local communities in the decision-making process.

Other key considerations include:

• OSMW release standards be established by the Government of Alberta to enable the development of appropriate design criteria for EPL to ensure any water released from the EPL will meet or exceed any water release standards set to allow the release of OSMW during and after mine operation.

• Tailings deposited in pit in a location designated for an EPL be treated to ensure that the objective of a fully functioning ecosystem can be met, as well as any other objectives the government may establish for EPLs.

• Based on R&D, establish an appropriate timeline for an EPL to form part of a functioning ecosystem.

• The Government of Alberta should develop specific objectives for management of froth treatment tailings, which may include prohibition on placing these tailings in an EPL.

• Indigenous communities be meaningfully involved in the design, implementation and monitoring of EPLs.

• Once EPLs with treated tailings are determined to be viable, recommend: Government of Alberta to design and establish an industry financed fund dedicated to the long-term monitoring and management of EPLs and potentially the mine site after final reclamation certification.

### Rationale for the Recommendation

The Steering Committee's recommendation of conducting further research and development to determine the viability of EPLs has been assessed against multiple feasibility criteria.

#### Policy and Regulatory Alignment

A key consideration is an acceptable timeline for EPLs to become part of a functional post reclamation landscape. To ensure that EPLs can become a viable part of the post-reclamation landscape within a reasonable timeframe, further work is necessary including the immediate establishment of OSMW release standards.

As noted in a presentation to the Steering Committee, with the absence of specific EPL policy or regulatory guidance, targets for stewarding pit lake adaptive management to achieve outcomes have relied on existing guidelines. This further emphasizes the need for EPL design guidance to ensure that EPLs meet ecological and human health objectives. Depending on the outcomes of R&D, this may also involve developing objectives for treated tailings deposited in a proposed EPL.

#### Environmental Impacts

R&D should focus on investigating bioaccumulation processes, assessing the toxicity levels of chemical compounds such as naphthenic acids, and analysing the challenges of, and key lessons learned, from existing demonstration lakes. Then, based on the findings, the acceptability of future EPLs with treated tailings can be determined. If they are acceptable EPLs must be designed and constructed to function as natural aquatic environments, supporting biodiversity and ecological health. This requires careful planning and design so that these lakes can support aquatic life and contribute to the overall ecological health of the region.

#### Indigenous Perspective

Engage local communities, including Indigenous communities, while the industry is conducting R&D in assessing the viability of EPLs. There is a concern among Indigenous communities regarding consuming traditional foods north of Fort McMurray due to perceived impacts of placing treated tailings in a mined-out pit, which may become an EPL. It will be necessary to work with local Indigenous communities through the research and planning on future EPL design, construction and monitoring of EPL performance to gain their confidence in the use of EPLs.

Furthermore, in an Indigenous submission to the Steering Committee, knowledge gaps on the study of demonstration EPLs were highlighted including the lack of suitable toxicity monitoring programs to assess the relevant chronic toxicity endpoints. Additionally, based on the results, there is a concern about exceedances of water and sediment quality criteria to protect aquatic health.

#### Public Perception

Clear, consistent and jargon-free communication to convey the findings from the R&D of EPL viability is essential to the public. Public perception of EPLs is mixed and varies depending on the approach taken. Effective communication, transparency and scientific research are essential to address these concerns and build public trust in EPL with treated tailings initiatives. For example, end-of-pipe compliance monitoring and Environmental Effects Monitoring (EEM) would help confirm that OSMW if released, will meet compliance requirements.

#### Economic Feasibility and Technology Viability

Oil sands operators are currently conducting pilot and full scale demonstrations of EPLs with both untreated and treated tailings. Based on the results the committee has seen to date, additional R&D is required. Tailings treatment objectives and technology may need to be modified based on the research findings. Tailings treatment can be based on site specific circumstances, therefore there may need to be site-specific R&D to address any unique site considerations.

The Steering Committee notes that ongoing research involving six Canadian universities indicates that water quality in the full scale demonstration EPLs is improving, indicating that EPLs with tailings might be viable in the future. Pathways Alliance, in its submission to the Steering Committee, stated that EPL research and demonstration to date, have indicated that the technology can be adapted to management of OSMW.

### Implementation Considerations

As part of the research and development, the following should be taken into account:

**EPL locations:** Consider the specific characteristics of mined-out areas for EPL placement, so EPL designs reduce risks and enhance ecological stability. These areas are fixed, and the design of EPLs must consider the specific characteristics of these locations while also incorporating a holistic view of the area.

**Maintaining EPLs in a closed-loop system:** EPLs to be maintained in a closed loop system until operators can demonstrate that the water in EPLs meet the established water quality standards for release, thereby, protecting downstream water bodies and aquatic life.

**Additional EPL design considerations:** It is essential to explore a variety of EPL designs and options to determine the viable effective strategies for transforming EPLs into healthy ecosystems. This could involve piloting alternative approaches, such as saline EPLs to assess their ecological benefits and impacts while also serving as a potential salt management solution.

These implementation considerations will help drive innovation and compliance through additional research, pilot projects, and by leveraging insights from existing lakes. Further research and understanding gleaned from lessons learned from existing demonstration lakes, such as Base Mine Lake and Lake Miwasin, are crucial for developing and enhancing an EPL framework, fostering technological innovation, and promoting sustainable development.

EPLs represent a reasonable opportunity for mine water management in Alberta's oil sands region, offering opportunities for ecological reclamation and sustainability. While EPLs without tailings have shown alignment with environmental goals, EPLs with treated tailings require concerted efforts in research, and development, regulation and community collaboration to unlock their potential.

## Recommendation: Inclusive water monitoring strategies

The Steering Committee examined the existing water monitoring system in the Athabasca oil sands region, including both ambient and regulatory components. Historical perceptions and events of poor water management and environmental degradation have impacted trust in the existing monitoring system, particularly among Indigenous communities. There remain ongoing concerns about the transparency and efficacy of regulatory oversight provided by the government.

There is a sentiment among Indigenous communities that a disconnect exists between industry, government and their communities. The Indigenous communities' submissions to the Steering Committee provided the following important insights:

• Calls for greater Indigenous involvement in monitoring efforts. • Demand for transparency in water management practices. • Emphasis on thorough and frequent monitoring to ensure environmental integrity. • Preservation of cultural significance of the land was a notable concern.

These insights outline opportunities to improve the existing monitoring and reporting processes to provide more transparency on monitoring results with a goal of improved trust in, and involvement with, the monitoring system. By addressing these challenges through effective monitoring and reporting strategies, the goal is to enhance the credibility and effectiveness of Alberta's OSMW monitoring programs.

### Recommendations

The Steering Committee recommends the following to build more inclusivity into OSMW monitoring, enhancing the credibility and transparency of water monitoring programs in the oil sands region.

**Recommendation 1:** Build on existing monitoring programs, such as the Oil Sands Monitoring Program, by supplementing them with Indigenous knowledge and other perspectives to support implementation of all the Steering Committee recommendations.

The committee believes existing frameworks and resources from established programs should be evaluated to identify gaps in community engagement and program design and increase the involvement of Indigenous communities and their contributions to government and industry monitoring.

This acknowledges that existing programs already have agreements with Indigenous communities, which can be leveraged alongside the knowledge and experiences of Indigenous communities and other communities within the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo.

**Recommendation 2:** Enhance transparency in data analysis and dissemination by government, regulator(s), industry and monitoring groups by accelerating timelines for release of water monitoring data in accessible and user-friendly formats.

This transparency holds regulator(s) and industry to a higher standard, ensuring they are actively working to share pertinent and timely information about monitoring results and operations.

### Rationale for the Recommendations

The following factors were considered when developing the recommendations.

#### Policy and Regulatory Alignment

Existing frameworks and monitoring programs offer a foundation for developing policies and achieving regulatory alignment. Under the Environmental Protection and Enhancement Act, oil sands operators are required to support and participate in regional monitoring programs, including the Oil Sands Monitoring (OSM) Program established by the Oil Sands Environmental Monitoring Program Regulation (2013). Participation in these programs, such as those run by the Wood Buffalo Environmental Association, is a condition of the approvals issued by the AER. These requirements compel operators to engage in comprehensive water monitoring across the lower Athabasca basin and pay an annual fee to fund the monitoring program.

Additional funding may be necessary to incorporate water monitoring requirements necessary to address some of the Steering Committee recommendations.

By providing transparent and easily accessible monitoring data to local communities, including Indigenous communities, the industry can enhance the efficacy of monitoring strategies, and work towards alignment of the parties interested in the monitoring program.

Additionally, incorporating diverse perspectives helps to address gaps in current monitoring strategies, ultimately leading to more comprehensive and effective policy development.

#### Environmental Impacts

There are current efforts being made to use monitoring to establish water quality guidelines, such as acute toxicity tests commonly used in end-of-pipe compliance monitoring for short-term exposure scenarios like spills. These tests provide crucial data to ensure that discharges meet safety standards and help prevent immediate harm to the environment. Additionally, toxicity tests are used in compliance monitoring of discharges and, though less frequently, in assessing the health of receiving environments. They also serve as a line of evidence in ecological risk assessments of contaminated sites.

Environmental Effects Monitoring (EEM) is another critical tool, offering a direct measure of effects on organisms, albeit post-occurrence. By actively tracking environmental impacts through these methods, involved parties, including Indigenous and local communities, gain visibility into monitoring initiatives aimed at mitigating adverse effects. This approach not only builds trust but also validates the effectiveness of monitoring strategies in tackling environmental challenges.

It is essential for both industry and government to maintain transparency as to the scientific data acquired from monitoring efforts to provide confidence that any environmental impacts can be quickly and effectively detected and managed.

#### Indigenous Perspective

Ensuring Indigenous community involvement in water monitoring efforts is crucial for achieving inclusive and effective environmental strategies. Community submissions highlight several concerns and priorities that align with the recommendations for improving monitoring practices. For instance, one Indigenous community emphasizes the need for ongoing monitoring and management to ensure water quality, addressing fears of erosion and water quality decline due to industrial activities. This aligns with the broader call for Indigenous involvement in monitoring, ensuring that their insights and Indigenous knowledge are integrated into decision-making processes. Another community underscores the importance of providing comprehensive data and addressing information gaps, which ties directly to the recommendation of transparency in data dissemination. Moreover, submissions stress the need for culturally respectful and ecologically sound reclamation outcomes, reinforcing the importance of Indigenous participation in monitoring to enhance confidence in protection of cultural and spiritual heritage.

By prioritizing these aspects, where Indigenous knowledge is used to help guide monitoring principles and program development, monitoring strategies can become more inclusive, fostering trust and transparency among all parties involved.

Indigenous knowledge combined with western science data enhances the credibility of water monitoring strategies. The monitoring data, when combined with Indigenous knowledge, not only demonstrates a commitment to environmental protection but also enhances the credibility of monitoring strategies amongst local communities.

#### Public Perception

To enhance public perception of the monitoring efforts, it is vital for both government and industry to prioritize transparency in their data collection, evaluation, analysis and reporting processes. Openly sharing methodologies and intentions behind data gathering and sharing this data in accessible ways, can build trust with the public. Additionally, presenting the results in a clear and accessible manner is essential. This means providing timely updates and utilizing user-friendly formats that cater to diverse audiences. Ensuring that information is both readily available and easy to understand can aid in fostering greater public confidence and in monitoring initiatives.

#### Economic Feasibility and Technology Viability

Recent technological advancements have significantly enhanced the feasibility of inclusive monitoring strategies in the oil sands industry. For example, there are advancements in water testing methods such as Biomimetic Extraction-Solid Phase Microextraction (BE-SPME). In a review of BE-SPME for analysis of water samples, it was found that the accuracy of the method aligns with current methods of testing and provides a broader range of applications.

Quick data turnaround is crucial for making timely decisions, implementing effective mitigation efforts, and building trust with local communities. Programs like the OSM are actively pursuing advanced monitoring technologies to expedite the public dissemination of data. In their 2024-2029 Strategic Plan, one of the OSM program's strategic priorities focuses on ensuring that data generated by the OSM Program is accurate, timely, relevant, and accessible, integrating Indigenous community-based knowledge ethically. Key actions include collaborating with stakeholders to define data needs, implementing user-friendly technology(ies) for diverse audiences, and regularly reporting on environmental health using clear indices developed with Indigenous communities and stakeholders. This rapid data sharing is essential for informed decision-making and fostering community trust.

The Steering Committee emphasizes using transparent and inclusive approaches for engaging and involving Indigenous communities in monitoring, evaluation and reporting activities.

### Implementation Considerations

Implementing strategies to build and maintain trust with Indigenous communities regarding monitoring programs in their traditional territories, requires careful attention to the following:

• **Implementing adaptive management processes** to consistently incorporate feedback from Indigenous communities. Adaptive management and responsiveness are vital for building and maintaining trust with Indigenous communities. Leveraging existing and establishing new mechanisms for Indigenous communities, as required, to provide feedback and ensuring this feedback is considered in program adjustments demonstrates a commitment to continuous improvement in a culturally meaningful manner over time.

• **Employing risk communication strategies** to address uncertainties and engage Indigenous communities in understanding potential environmental risks. Addressing concerns and misconceptions transparently, acknowledging uncertainties and limitations, and clearly communicating efforts to address challenges further strengthens confidence among Indigenous communities.

• **Need to correlate with existing data.** There has been a significant amount of data collected and monitored over a number of years, and the need to be able to review historical data and link them to current data to monitor and forecast trends will be necessary. The linkages will enable an understanding of the progress being made and build trust that while new data may be used, the existing environmental indicators will continue to be tracked moving forward.

• **Funding for monitoring.** Consideration should be given to establishing an industry financed fund for any water monitoring associated with implementation of the Steering Committee recommendations.
