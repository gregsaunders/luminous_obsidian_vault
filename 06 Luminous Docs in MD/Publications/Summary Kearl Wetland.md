# Detailed Summary: Multi-year trends in the spatiotemporal occurrence and fate of naphthenic acid fraction compounds in a pilot-scale engineered treatment wetland

## Study Overview

This research evaluated the effectiveness of a pilot-scale constructed wetland treatment system (CWTS) for removing naphthenic acid fraction compounds (NAFCs) from oil sands process-affected water (OSPW) at the Kearl Oil Sands site in Northern Alberta, Canada. The study was conducted over two field seasons (2021 and 2022) using high-resolution Orbitrap mass spectrometry to track molecular-level changes in contaminants.

## Background & Context

### The Oil Sands Challenge

- The Athabasca Oil Sands Region contains ~1.4 billion m³ of fluid tailings with toxic constituents
- Oil extraction requires 2-4 barrels of water per barrel of bitumen produced
- OSPW accumulates toxic compounds, particularly naphthenic acids (NAs) and related compounds (NAFCs)
- No current water release guidelines exist - operators must retain OSPW on-site indefinitely

### Naphthenic Acid Fraction Compounds (NAFCs)

- **Classical NAs**: Follow formula CₙH₂ₙ₊ᵤO₂ (where Z indicates ring formation)
- **NAFCs**: Broader category including NAs plus compounds with heteroatoms (S, N, Oₓ)
- Primary contributors to OSPW toxicity affecting fish, invertebrates, and mammals
- Particularly toxic are O₂-NAFCs (classical naphthenic acids)

### Treatment Approach

Constructed wetland treatment systems (CWTSs) offer advantages as a treatment option:

- Semi-passive operation with low ongoing costs
- Minimal energy and chemical inputs required
- Potential for large-volume treatment
- Proven effectiveness for municipal and industrial wastewater

## Study Site & Design

### Kearl Treatment Wetland (KTW)

- **Size**: 1 hectare (0.76 ha surface area)
- **Capacity**: 6,400-10,800 m³ OSPW depending on fill level
- **Design**: Contained, recirculating free water surface system
- **Components**: Mix of shallow areas (~0.4m depth) and deep pools (~1.7m depth)
- **Operation**: 14-day retention time, pumping at ~5 L/s

### Wetland Cells

1. **Forebay area**: Entry point for OSPW (125 m², 1.7m deep)
2. **Shallow Areas 1-2**: 275 m² each, 0.4m deep
3. **Deep Pool 1**: 135 m², 1.7m deep
4. **Shallow Areas 5-6**: 100 m² each, 0.4m deep
5. **Deep Pool 2**: 125 m², 1.7m deep

## Methodology

### Sample Collection & Processing

- **2021**: Single samples from each cell at 3 time points (Days 0, 15, 45)
- **2022**: Duplicate samples from each cell at 9 time points over 98 days
- Samples extracted using solid-phase extraction (SPE) with methanol elution
- Chloride concentrations used to correct for evapotranspiration effects in 2022

### Analytical Approach

- **Orbitrap Mass Spectrometry**: High-resolution analysis (240,000 resolution)
- **Quantification**: External standard curves (10-100 mg/L range)
- **Molecular Assignment**: Custom algorithms identifying chemical formulae
- **Statistical Analysis**: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Wilcoxon testing

## Key Findings

### 2021 Field Season (45 days)

**Concentration Changes:**

- Initial NAFC concentrations: 60-70 mg/L near fill point
- Stabilized by Day 15: 43.4 ± 1.9 mg/L
- Day 45: 42.2 ± 1.9 mg/L (minimal further change)

**Molecular Transformations:**

- O₂-NAFCs (classical NAs) decreased from 64-70% to 52-57%
- O₃- and O₄-NAFCs increased (evidence of oxidation)
- O₅-containing compounds appeared
- O₃S-NAFCs disappeared while O₂S-NAFCs increased

### 2022 Field Season (98 days)

**Concentration Changes:**

- Pre-fill concentrations: 5-17 mg/L (residual water)
- Post-fill (Day 0): 57-72 mg/L
- Final (Day 98): 40.5 ± 2.7 mg/L
- **Overall reduction: 36% decrease in total NAFC mass**

**Treatment Rates:**

- **Period 1 (Days 0-15)**: ~0.53 mg/L/day removal rate
- **Period 2 (Days 30-69)**: ~0.25 mg/L/day removal rate
- Rate decrease likely due to seasonal factors and depletion of easily degraded compounds

**Molecular-Level Changes:**

- O₂-NAFCs declined from ~65% to ~45% relative abundance
- Highest molecular weight O₂-NAFCs (#C > 14) showed greatest decreases
- O₃- and O₄-NAFCs increased throughout season
- O₃S-NAFCs became undetectable while O₂S-NAFCs persisted

### Spatial Variations

**Shallow vs. Deep Areas:**

- Shallow, heavily vegetated cells showed:
    - Lower NAFC concentrations
    - More oxygen-rich compounds
    - Greater treatment effectiveness
- Higher photoactive to photo-inactive water volume ratio in shallow areas
- Enhanced oxidative processes in shallow segments

### OSPW Refill Effects

**Day 20 Refill (1,545 m³):**

- Subtle effects on concentrations
- Some increase in O₂S-compounds in shallow areas
- 10 days allowed for mixing before next sampling

**Day 70 Refill (1,290 m³):**

- More noticeable immediate effects
- Segments near fill point showed increased O₂-NAFC abundance
- Effects diminished by Day 98
- Only 1 day for mixing before sampling

## Treatment Mechanisms

### Oxidative Degradation Evidence

1. **Molecular signatures**: Systematic increase in oxygen content of compounds
2. **Selective removal**: Preferential elimination of classical NAs (O₂-NAFCs)
3. **Transformation products**: Formation of more oxidized species (O₃, O₄, O₅)

### Contributing Processes

- **Photolysis**: Light-driven oxidation in surface waters
- **Biodegradation**: Microbial transformation of compounds
- **Plant uptake**: Direct absorption by macrophytes
- **Seasonal effects**: Declining rates with reduced sunlight and plant senescence

## Seasonal Factors Affecting Treatment

### Early Season (High Efficiency)

- Maximum daylight hours (15-18 hours)
- Active plant growth and metabolism
- Optimal temperature conditions
- Fresh, more labile NAFCs available

### Late Season (Reduced Efficiency)

- Decreasing daylight (down to 12 hours)
- Plant senescence and reduced uptake
- Lower temperatures
- More recalcitrant compounds remaining
- Possible nutrient depletion

## Environmental Significance

### Toxicity Implications

- O₂-NAFCs are primary toxicants in OSPW
- 80% of total NAFC attenuation attributed to O₂-NAFC removal
- Selective elimination of highest molecular weight compounds
- Potential correlation with toxicity reduction (requires further study)

### Treatment Efficiency

- **Detection limits**: NAFC removal effective down to 1.5-15 mg/L range
- **Removal rates**: 0.25-0.53 mg/L/day depending on conditions
- **Molecular specificity**: Preferential removal of most toxic fraction
- **Oxidative transformation**: Conversion to less harmful oxidized products

## Study Limitations & Future Directions

### Current Limitations

- Semi-quantitative nature of NAFC analysis (no standard reference materials)
- Limited understanding of specific degradation pathway contributions
- Single site study - generalizability unclear
- No direct toxicity measurements

### Recommended Future Research

1. **Multi-site evaluation**: Test effectiveness across different OSPW types
2. **Mechanistic studies**: Quantify relative contributions of different processes
3. **Toxicity validation**: Confirm that molecular changes correlate with reduced toxicity
4. **Optimization studies**: Evaluate different wetland designs and parameters
5. **Genomics research**: Identify microorganisms and metabolic pathways involved

## Practical Implications
