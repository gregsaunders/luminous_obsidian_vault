### Part 1: Industry Email Strategy

I have created two versions.

- **Version A (Operators - CNRL, Suncor, Imperial):** Focuses on operational efficiency, sample prep headaches, and cost savings.
    
- **Version B (Pathways Alliance):** Focuses on the macro-narrative of "Transparency," "Closure," and meeting the OSMWSC guidelines.
    

#### Version A: For Operators (CNRL, Suncor, Imperial)

**Subject:** NAFC Workshop Follow-up: The "Tier 1" Solution

Hi [Name],

I’ve been reviewing the final notes from the **NAFC Measurement Workshop** in July. It was a productive session, and the report highlights a critical gap in the industry’s current monitoring strategy.

The group explicitly identified the need for a **"Tiered Monitoring Approach"** —specifically, a scalable, high-throughput screening tool to bridge the gap between rapid (but non-specific) FTIR and accurate (but slow) Mass Spec.

Luminous has been developing exactly this capability. We believe we are the "Tier 1" solution the group is asking for:

1. **Solving the Prep Headache:** The workshop voted "Extraction" as the #1 critical stage for reliable results. Our platform uses a minimal-prep protocol that bypasses the SPE/LLE debate entirely.
    
2. **Speed + Specificity:** We offer the operational speed of FTIR but with the biological specificity to distinguish toxic NAs from background organics (solving the false positive issue).
    
3. **From Testing to Optimization:** Beyond just "testing," we are deploying a **Relational Context Engine** (validated at Kearl) that correlates toxicity data with your operational variables (flow, temp, depth) to actively optimize treatment performance.
    

We are currently finalizing a dataset that directly addresses the "Sample Prep" and "Interference" concerns raised in the report.

I’d love to share these results with you before we present them to the wider working group. Do you have 15 minutes next week?

Best,

Jeff

#### Version B: For Pathways Alliance

**Subject:** Aligning with OSMWSC Recommendations: The Missing "Tier 1" Layer

Hi [Name],

Following the release of the **NAFC Measurement Workshop** report, I wanted to highlight how Luminous is aligning our technology to support the industry's broader closure goals.

The workshop, convened to address OSMWSC recommendations, identified a clear need for a **"Tiered Monitoring Approach"**. The industry needs a defensible, high-throughput screening layer to ensure transparency and visibility across the vast water inventories we are managing.

Luminous is positioned to fill this specific gap:

- **Scalability:** We address the "scalability" challenge with a high-throughput platform that creates the data density required for transparent reporting.
    
- **Operational Insight:** Our **Relational Context Engine** moves beyond static compliance testing to provide the operational visibility required by the new monitoring frameworks.
    

We are preparing a response to the working group that maps our data directly to the gaps identified in the report (specifically regarding Sample Prep and Specificity).

I would value your perspective on this strategic alignment. Are you open to a brief discussion?

Best,

Jeff
