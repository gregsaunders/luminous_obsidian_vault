## A. Industry Partner Commitment (Top Priority)

**Objective:** - Secure Letters of Support/Interest from CNRL, Suncor, Pathways Alliance and/or Imperial Oil before the end of August to include in the September 24th submission.
    
- **The "Win" for Them:**
    
    - **Technical Teams:** "We have a scientifically validated tool that makes your job easier. Our biosensors give you the fast, high-resolution data you need to optimize the systems you're already building (like wetlands), and our bioaugmentation solves the 'slowing degradation' problem identified in the Kearl report."
        
    - **Executives:** "We offer a low-risk, homegrown solution to your multi-billion-dollar liability problem. Partnering with us on this ERA grant demonstrates innovation, aligns with the Steering Committee's goals, and provides a clear, positive ESG story."
        
- **Action Plan:**
    
    1. **Immediately:** Send the tailored emails we have already drafted to your contacts at CNRL and Suncor (Joy, Theo, Jayne, Ashkan).
        
    2. **Within 2 Weeks:** Conduct follow-up calls. Use the 10-slide pitch deck we designed for executive-level conversations and focus on the two key research papers for technical discussions.
        
    3. **Within 4 Weeks:** Provide them with a draft "Letter of Support" template to make it easy for them to say yes.
