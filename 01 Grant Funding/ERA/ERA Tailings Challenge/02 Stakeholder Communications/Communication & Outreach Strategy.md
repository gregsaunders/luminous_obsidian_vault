## A. Industry Partner Commitment (Top Priority)

**Objective:** - Secure Letters of Support/Interest from CNRL, Suncor, Pathways Alliance and/or Imperial Oil before the end of August to include in the September 24th submission.
    
- **The "Win" for Them:**
    
    - **Technical Teams:** "We have a scientifically validated tool that makes your job easier. Our biosensors give you the fast, high-resolution data you need to optimize the systems you're already building (like wetlands), and our bioaugmentation solves the 'slowing degradation' problem identified in the Kearl report."
        
    - **Executives:** "We offer a low-risk, homegrown solution to your multi-billion-dollar liability problem. Partnering with us on this ERA grant demonstrates innovation, aligns with the Steering Committee's goals, and provides a clear, positive ESG story."
        
- **Action Plan:**
    
    1. **Immediately:** Send the tailored emails we have already drafted to your contacts at CNRL and Suncor (Joy, Theo, Jayne, Ashkan).
        
    2. **Within 2 Weeks:** Conduct follow-up calls. Use the 10-slide pitch deck we designed for executive-level conversations and focus on the two key research papers for technical discussions.
        
    3. **Within 4 Weeks:** Provide them with a draft "Letter of Support" template to make it easy for them to say yes.

## **B. Stakeholder & Indigenous Engagement**

**Objective:** Initiate contact and build relationships with key Indigenous communities and local stakeholders to demonstrate your commitment to ERA's engagement criteria.
    
- **The "Win" for Them:** "We are developing a natural, chemical-free solution to help restore the health of the water in your territory. A core part of our mission is transparency, and our data platform is designed to provide communities like yours with clear, real-time information, building trust and empowering you with knowledge."
    
- **Action Plan:**
    
    1. **Within 2-3 Weeks:** Identify and begin respectful outreach to the appropriate contacts within key communities (e.g., Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation, Mikisew Cree First Nation) and relevant environmental organizations.
        
    2. **Within 4-6 Weeks:** Schedule introductory meetings. The goal is to listen and share your vision, focusing on the natural approach and the transparency offered by your data platform. The aim is to build a relationship that can lead to a letter of support or, at minimum, be described positively in your application's "Stakeholder Engagement" section.
        

#### **C. Pre-Seed Capital**

**Objective:** Secure a lead angel investor to anchor your $1.5M pre-seed round.
    
- **The "Win" for Them:** "This is a rare pre-seed opportunity to invest in a company with a scientifically de-risked technology (peer-reviewed and patented), a massive and concentrated addressable market ($30B+ liability), a clear path to revenue, and a mission that provides both significant financial returns and a profound positive impact on Alberta."
    
- **Action Plan:**
    
    1. **Immediately:** Finalize the 10-slide investor pitch deck based on our blueprint.
        
    2. **Within 2-4 Weeks:** Leverage your network (including CDL contacts) to secure warm introductions to 5-10 target angel investors who fit your ideal profile.
        
    3. **Ongoing:** Conduct investor meetings using the pitch deck. The goal is to secure a lead investor who can provide momentum and help close the round.
