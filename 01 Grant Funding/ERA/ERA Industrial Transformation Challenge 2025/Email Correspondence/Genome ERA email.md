Subject: ERA Industrial Transformation Challenge - Luminous Genomics Submission

Hello ,

It was great connecting with you last month regarding our naphthenic acid biosensor technology. Since our discussion, we've came across the ERA's Industrial Transformation Challenge 2025 as an ideal funding opportunity for our solution. We wanted to update you on our plans and show how it aligns with Genome Alberta.

The ERA call (deadline June 12) perfectly aligns with our technology across all their environmental remediation categories:

- Water treatment (NA remediation in OSPW)
- Land reclamation (enabling tailings pond closure)
- Air quality improvement (reducing pond emissions)

We've accelerated our bioaugmentation approach, identifying and cultivating specific bacterial strains native to northern Alberta that show promising NA degradation capabilities. This will be a first-of-kind integrated offering combining real-time detection, data analytics, and targeted remediation at industrial scale.

We would love to discuss the a potential endorsement on this submission? With this being an Genomics based Industrial Application we believe this would be advantageous for Genomics in Alberta. There is no binding element to this submission.

Sorry for the urgency to chat but the submission deadline is June 12 and I want to have all partners secured for the submission. 

Please let me know if you have availability this week to chat

Regards,

Jeff
