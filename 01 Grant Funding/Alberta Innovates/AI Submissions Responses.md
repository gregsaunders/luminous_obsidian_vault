## BioLuminescent Monitoring and Remediation Platform: Enabling Safe Water Release from Oil Sands Tailings

## 1. Project Summary

##### This is a brief, non-confidential lay summary of the project, the activities to be performed and the anticipated outcomes. When preparing this section, consider using a third-person narrative format.

Alberta's oil sands tailings ponds present an urgent environmental challenge: 1.4 trillion litres of process-affected water contaminated with persistent, toxic naphthenic acids (NAs). These compounds prevent safe water release, delay land reclamation, increase financial liabilities for operators, and erode public trust. The industry faces a critical bottleneck – monitoring NAs requires expensive, slow laboratory methods that yield sporadic, limited data snapshots, leaving operators essentially blind to real-time changes and hampering efforts to develop effective remediation strategies. 

Luminous BioSolutions' BioLuminescent Monitoring and Remediation Platform offers a transformative solution. The technology harnesses engineered bacteria that emit light in direct proportion to NA concentration, providing results within minutes rather than weeks. Unlike conventional methods, **these biosensors can detect multiple classes of NAs at concentrations that are present in tailings ponds  (10-120 mg/L)** at a fraction of current costs, enabling comprehensive monitoring across vast tailings volumes.

This project will optimize a multi-biosensor panel for the lab or potential field deployment, **and will be validated with mass spectrometry**. We're developing an analytics platform that transforms real-time data into actionable intelligence. **Our biosensor panel goes beyond detection of NA in water, it allows rapid  identification of NA degrading abilities of naturally occurring bacteria in OSPW,  thereby identifying the essential microbes for bioaugmentation  approaches.**

The stark contrast between current and future states is compelling: from sporadic, expensive NA monitoring to continuous, affordable monitoring; from uncertainty about NA distribution to precise mapping; from reactive management to proactive solutions; and ultimately, f**rom indefinite containment to pathways for safe water treatment and eventual water release.**

The outcomes will revolutionize tailings management: Significant reduction in monitoring costs, unprecedented temporal and spatial resolution of NA data, accelerated remediation timelines, and a science-based framework for regulatory compliance. This made-in-Alberta innovation directly addresses a pressing environmental challenge while creating new economic opportunities in environmental technology – a perfect alignment of ecological responsibility and economic advancement.

### Problem Severity from Customer Perspective
##### Explain and quantify the seriousness of the problem/challenge, from a customer/end-user perspective, that this Innovation aims to address:

Oil sands operators face a significant challenge with naphthenic acids (NAs) in tailings ponds. With 1.4 trillion litres of process-affected water under management and increasing, these toxic compounds represent the primary barrier to water release and land reclamation. The consequences are substantial and measurable:

Financial impacts are considerable – operators collectively have between $33B-$130B in asset retirement obligations, and tailings remediation is the largest component. Without effective NA monitoring and treatment, these liabilities grow, affecting financial planning and investor confidence. Delayed reclamation significantly increases future costs.

Operational constraints are evident with some operators approaching storage capacity limits, potentially affecting production. Provincial directives require tailings to be ready-to-reclaim within 10 years of mine closure, yet current NA management approaches cannot meet these timelines.

The persistence of NAs compounds this challenge – these molecules can remain toxic in tailings ponds for decades under natural conditions. The slow degradation rate of complex NAs creates a critical need for accelerated breakdown mechanisms, as natural attenuation timelines are incompatible with regulatory and business requirements.

Regulatory requirements create complexity – without reliable, comprehensive NA monitoring data, operators cannot demonstrate compliance with emerging water quality standards for potential release. Current monitoring methods cost $500-**1,000** per sample and require weeks for results, making frequent, **high throughput** sampling economically impractical.

Community and stakeholder relationships are challenged – concerns about NA impacts on watershed health influence social license to operate and regulatory approvals. Indigenous communities downstream have expressed specific concerns about long-term water quality impacts.

Current initiatives addressing the problem include industry consortia developing physical-chemical treatment technologies and researching passive treatment systems. However, these efforts are constrained by both inadequate monitoring tools and inefficient NA degradation mechanisms. Without solving both the detection problem and accelerating the breakdown of these persistent compounds, operators remain in a difficult position regarding environmental compliance and regulatory requirements.

### Detailed Description of the Innovation

### The Innovation

Luminous BioSolutions has developed a comprehensive monitoring and remediation solution that addresses the naphthenic acid (NA) challenge in oil sands tailings ponds through three integrated components: biosensor detection, data analytics, and bioremediation acceleration.

The foundation of this innovation are bioluminescent bacterial biosensors – engineered microorganisms that emit light when they encounter NAs, the intensity directly proportional to NA concentration. This living technology enables rapid, cost-effective monitoring while simultaneously identifying bacterial strains capable of breaking down these persistent compounds.

The solution consists of three components:

1a. Multi-Biosensor Panel for NA Detection: Our panel features three distinct biosensors, each responding to different classes of NAs found in tailings ponds:
    - atuA biosensor responds primarily to acyclic NAs, 
    - marR biosensor detects complex, multi-ringed NAs, 
    - 3680 biosensor highly sensitive to classic NAs, 
    
**1b. Biosensors can be grown directly in water sample to detect NAs at concentrations between 10-120 mg/L. For lower NA concentrations, water can be evaporated and tested immediately, or NAs are concentrated using solid phase extraction and tested to produce semi-quantitative** results.

2. Bioaugmentation for Enhanced NA Degradation:  **We cultivate and identify naturally occurring, NA degrading bacteria using the NA biosensors, which can be done in a period of days, compared to years using analytical chemistry methods. These bacteria can be:**
    - Grown as **pure cultures or defined, simple communities** for optimal performance in water treatment systems (eg. constructed wetlands, pit lake)
    - Produced at scale for direct introduction (bioaugmentation) into treatment process
    - Paired with monitoring to create closed-loop optimization of remediation 
    - **Supplemented with proprietary nutrients to stimulate growth and degradation (biostimulation)**
    
3. Data Analytics Platform: Our software compiles biosensor readings and remediation performance data to create actionable intelligence for tailings management:
    - Near real-time mapping of NA concentrations 
    - Trend analysis to identify changing conditions and prediction
    - Remediation tracking to validate treatment approaches
    - Regulatory reporting tools for transparent communication

Scientific Validation

Our technology is built on solid scientific foundations and preliminary validation. Our biosensors have demonstrated:

- Detection limits of **1.5-15 mg/L** , aligning with environmentally relevant NA concentrations in tailings ponds (10-120 mg/L)
- **Minimal water treatment to concentrate and detect NA at low concentration.**
- Clear dose-dependent responses to NA mixtures, enabling semi-quantitative measurement
- Specificity to different NA classes, allowing for comprehensive assessment of NA composition
- Successful detection of NAs in **actual raw and treated OSPW samples** from oil sands facilities
- Response times of minutes compared to weeks for conventional analytical methods

Our bioaugmentation approach is supported by research showing specific bacterial strains can degrade NAs under **lab c**onditions. Degradation rates varying by NA structure,  our technology identifies the most effective degraders for each NA class present in a specific tailings facility.

The scientific principles underpinning this technology are documented in peer-reviewed research, including publications demonstrating successful biosensor construction for NA detection in OSPW.

Unique Advantages

This integrated approach offers distinct advantages over current methods:

Comprehensive solution: Monitoring and remediation in a single, platform that addresses detection and treatment challenges.

Speed: Monitoring results within minutes versus weeks for conventional methods, enabling rapid decision-making and treatment optimization.

Cost-effectiveness: significant cost reduction per test compared to mass spectrometry, making comprehensive monitoring economically viable.

Targeted remediation: Identifies and deploys bacteria specifically effective against the NA profile of each individual tailings facility, rather than generic treatments.

Continuous improvement: The closed-loop system of monitoring, treatment, and re-monitoring creates continuous optimization cycle improving effectiveness over time.

Actionable intelligence: Transforms complex biological data into clear visualizations and recommendations that support operational decisions.

Applications and Users

Primary applications include:

- Baseline mapping: Comprehensive assessment of NA concentrations and distribution
- Treatment design: Identification of optimal bacterial communities for NA degradation
- Remediation implementation: Bioaugmentation with site-specific bacterial consortia
- Performance validation: Real-time monitoring of NA removal efficiency
- Release readiness: Validation of water quality for potential future release

Potential users span the oil sands ecosystem, operators, **environmental monitoring providers, consultants**, local stakeholders, regulators, and research institutions.

Competitive Landscape

Current monitoring relies on analytical chemistry methods that are accurate but expensive and slow for frequent sampling. Current remediation approaches include physical-chemical treatments and passive systems (constructed wetlands). These lack precision targeting of specific NAs that our bioaugmentation approach provides.

No solution combines rapid detection of biosensors with the identification and deployment of NA-degrading bacteria. This integration creates a powerful system that not only identifies the problem but provides the solution in a continuous improvement framework.

Pathway to Implementation

The technology has progressed through laboratory validation and is ready for field testing. Initial deployments will focus on biosensor monitoring to establish baselines, **followed by **bioaugmentation in pilot scale experiments in mesocosms, progressing to trials in constructed wetlands.** The analytics system will evolve based on field data, creating an increasingly valuable dataset with each deployment.

This innovation represents a practical, biologically-based approach to a complex environmental challenge. By making comprehensive NA monitoring economically viable and pairing it with targeted remediation, it addresses both the detection and treatment aspects of tailings management, ultimately supporting the industry's goal of responsible water management and reclamation.
