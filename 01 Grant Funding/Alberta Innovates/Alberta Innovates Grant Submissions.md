## Alignment Analysis: Luminous BioSolutions & Alberta Innovates Environmental Innovation Program

![[Pasted image 20250514161950.png]]
### Primary Focus Area: Water Innovation (WI)

1. **Theme 4: Water Quality Protection**
    - Our biosensor technology addresses "understanding, mitigating and managing contaminants' impacts on water supplies (focus on emerging contaminants)" - naphthenic acids being a key contaminant of concern
    - )our work also supports "safe oil sands mine water release" which is explicitly mentioned as a priority
2. **Theme 2: Healthy Aquatic Ecosystems**
    - Your technology helps "mitigate and manage impacts of human-derived contaminants on aquatic ecosystems"
    - Your work contributes to "understanding cumulative landscape-level impacts and developing mitigation strategies"

### Secondary Alignment: Land Management Solutions (LMS)

Your work also connects to:
1. **Theme 1: Efficient Land-use**
    
    - Your technology facilitates "Site rehabilitation: Remediation and reclamation (oil sands tailings)"
2. **Theme 4: Environmental Monitoring and Modeling**
    
    - Your biosensors provide innovative monitoring capabilities for "land cover, soil and carbon monitoring"

## Strategic Recommendations for Your Application

### 1. Application Structure

Based on the requirements in the Application Guide (AE-EOI-Application-Guide.pdf), your application will need to follow a two-phase process:

- Phase 1: Expression of Interest (EOI)
- Phase 2: Full Proposal (by invitation only)

### 2. Project Type

Your project should be classified as a **Technology Development** project (rather than Knowledge Generation) as you are developing biosensor technology with a clear commercialization pathway.

### 3. Key Messaging Focus Points

#### Innovation Opportunity (Critical for EOI evaluation)

- **Frame the challenge**: Emphasize that naphthenic acids (NAs) are the primary toxic components in oil sands process-affected water (OSPW), preventing safe water release, delaying land reclamation, and creating financial liabilities
- **Highlight technology differentiation**: Current NA monitoring methods (mass spectrometry) are accurate but expensive, slow, and impractical for large-scale monitoring - your bacterial biosensors offer a fast, cost-effective, highly scalable alternative
- **Stress TRL advancement**: Clearly show your current Technology Readiness Level (TRL 3-7 is required) and how the project will advance this

#### Market Opportunity & Commercialization Pathway (Critical for Full Proposal)

- **Target market**: Oil sands operators, environmental consulting firms, and regulatory bodies
- **Value proposition**: Real-time monitoring at a fraction of the cost of current methods
- **Go-to-market strategy**: Outline your pilot project approach with industry partners

#### Implementation Plan

- **Clear milestones**: Define specific technical achievements with measurable outcomes
- **Risk management**: Acknowledge technical challenges and mitigation strategies
- **Team expertise**: Highlight the microbiology, biosensor engineering, and industry experience of your team

#### Impact

- **Economic impact**: Cost savings for industry, potential new cleantech industry in Alberta
- **Environmental impact**: Better monitoring enabling better remediation, supporting eventual safe water release
- **Social impact**: Increasing transparency and trust with communities and regulators

## Application Structure Outline

Here's a suggested outline that aligns with Alberta Innovates' evaluation criteria:

### For EOI Application:

**1. Innovation Opportunity (Most Critical Section)**

- Problem statement: The scale and challenge of naphthenic acids in tailings ponds (1.39 trillion liters)
- Current monitoring limitations: Expensive, slow, impractical at scale
- Your innovation: Bacterial biosensors that provide rapid, cost-effective NA detection
- Technology differentiation: Speed (minutes vs. weeks), specificity to different NA types, cost advantages
- TRL advancement: From current level to targeted advancement through this project

**2. Proposed Commercialization Pathway**

- Target customers: Oil sands operators, environmental consultancies, regulators
- Market pull: Coming water release regulations requiring extensive monitoring
- Commercialization steps: Validation with industry partners, regulatory acceptance
- Risk mitigation strategies for technology adoption

**3. Project Overview**

- Clear objectives: e.g., optimization of biosensor panel, field testing validation, etc.
- Key deliverables and outcomes: Specific performance metrics for the biosensors
- Project team capabilities: Expertise in biosensor development, NA analysis, etc.

**4. Impact**

- Environmental: Better monitoring enabling improved remediation strategies
- Economic: Cost savings for industry, potential new Alberta-based cleantech
- Social: Increased transparency and stakeholder trust
- Alignment with Environmental Innovation Program goals: Safe water release, healthy aquatic ecosystems

### For Full Proposal (if invited):

The Full Proposal would expand on the above sections with more detail and add:

**1. Project Budget and Funding Commitment**

- Detailed budget with clear justification
- Matching funds and industry partner contributions (if applicable)

**2. Expanded Project Team**

- Specific roles, expertise, and time commitments
- Access to appropriate facilities and resources

## Key Messaging Recommendations

1. **Lead with the problem scale and urgency**: The massive volume of tailings ponds (1.39 trillion liters) and the coming regulatory requirements create an urgent need for better monitoring solutions.
    
2. **Emphasize uniqueness**: Your biosensors are the first of their kind specifically for NA detection with proven sensitivity to the different classes of NAs found in tailings ponds.
    
3. **Highlight scientific validation**: The science behind your approach has been published and validated (as shown in the research paper documentation).
    
4. **Stress the dual benefits**: Your technology not only offers better monitoring but also supports remediation through identifying NA-degrading bacteria.
    
5. **Connect to Alberta priorities**: Show how your technology directly supports Alberta's goals for responsible resource development and environmental protection.
