# Pilot Proposal: Biosensor Monitoring for Constructed Wetland Treatment

**To:** Canadian Natural Resources Limited  
**From:** Luminous BioSolutions  
**Date:** January 2026

---

## The Proposal

A 12-month pilot deploying our biosensor on one CNRL constructed wetland. We deliver naphthenic acid results in 24-72 hours instead of weeks.

**Pilot Price:** $750,000  
**With Alberta Innovates 50% Match:** $375,000 net to CNRL  
**Timeline:** May 2026 – April 2027

## The Problem

Your engineers are making treatment decisions with incomplete information. Traditional lab analysis takes weeks. Between monthly results, they're guessing.

We saw this at Kearl. Engineers managed conservatively because they couldn't see what was happening between tests. Water additions, treatment adjustments—all made with limited visibility. No data means safety mode. Sensible, but inefficient.

The good news: Kearl showed that wetlands significantly reduce naphthenic acid toxicity. The path to safe water release is real.

But proving it to regulators takes more than seasonal snapshots. It takes continuous, high-frequency data. That's what we provide.

---

## What We Bring

- TRL 8 biosensor with high HRMS correlation
- Peer-reviewed paper published on the biosensor, with a new paper specific to the Kearl wetland results coming February 5, 2026
- Multi-season field experience from the Kearl academic pilot
- Squarehead Foundry data platform for real-time dashboards

---

## Expected Value

Based on what we observed at Kearl, we're confident this enables at least $250,000 or more in annual operational value:

- Better-timed interventions
- Less over-engineering
- Faster issue identification
- Optimized water management

This isn't a number we made up. We watched engineers manage a wetland with monthly data. We saw the decisions they couldn't make and the conservative defaults they relied on. $250,000 is a baseline. The upside is likely higher.

Longer-term, there's regulatory positioning and ARO implications—but that's a conversation for after we prove the operational value.

## What's Included

**Field Season (May – October 2026)**

- Biosensor deployment on one wetland
- 30+ samples per day
- 24-72 hour turnaround
- We handle sample logistics

**Full 12 Months**

- Squarehead Foundry dashboard
- Integration with your data feeds where possible
- Quarterly updates
- Final evaluation report

**Not included:** Multi-site deployment, regulatory dashboards, full enterprise integration. Those come with a full subscription post-pilot.

## The Investment

||Amount|
|---|---|
|Pilot Price|$750,000|
|Alberta Innovates Match|$375,000|
|**CNRL Net**|**$375,000**|

Alberta Innovates is aware of our plans and has responded positively. They're ready to engage once we have a committed industry partner.

## The Team

**Shawn Lewenza, PhD** — Chief Science Officer  
Invented the biosensor. 30+ years as a microbiologist. Professor at Athabasca University, Adjunct at University of Calgary.

**Greg Saunders** — Chief Technology Officer  
Co-founder of Squarehead Foundry. Builds the data platform.

**Jeff Violo** — COO & Co-Founder  
Business development and project delivery.

We're a focused team. You work directly with the people who built this—no layers, no translation required. We scale as needed.

---

## Why Now

The Oil Sands Mining Water Steering Committee is developing water release frameworks. Alberta wants guidelines in place within 12-18 months.

When those guidelines land, regulators will want data. Operators with a data history will move faster. A pilot starting May 2026 gives CNRL 12+ months of continuous monitoring before the rules are finalized.

We're looking for an early adopter. CNRL operates wetlands, understands the challenge, and can move without months of internal process. That's why we're here.

---

## After the Pilot

If this works, we'll discuss a full subscription. Scope and pricing depend on what you need—regulatory dashboards, stakeholder access, deeper integration. We can figure that out together based on what the pilot tells us.

But that's for Q1 2027. Right now, we're focused on proving value.

---

## Questions for Discussion

1. We'd like to discuss deploying on the constructed wetland at your Albian site—does that make sense from your side?
2. What does your current monitoring look like there?
3. Who would be day-to-day contact?
4. What does success look like after 12 months?

---

## Next Steps

We'd like a call to discuss fit. If there's interest, we target a Letter of Intent in February and deployment by May/June.
