# Non-Dilutive Funding Opportunities

**Target:** Secure matching funds for 4 planned pilots (Q2 2026 - Q4 2027)
**Status:** Research phase - applications to start Week 5-8
**Last Updated:** 2025-11-18

## Executive Summary

The **$2.5M** fundraise is predicated on successfully securing **1:1 matching funds** from grants (ERA/AI) and operators for our pilot deployment costs. Our total pilot delivery cost is estimated at **$780K-$967K over 24 months**, which must be covered by this matching strategy. Non-dilutive grants are critical to leveraging the raise.

## Provincial Programs (Alberta)

### 4. Emissions Reduction Alberta (ERA)

**Luminous Fit:**
- ✅ Alberta-based, oil sands focus, strong environmental impact.
- **CRITICAL:** Needed to provide the 50% government matching for pilot deployment costs.

### 5. Alberta Innovates - Technology Development & Demonstration Program

**Luminous Fit:**
- ✅ Alberta-based, demonstration phase aligns perfectly with pilot deployment.
- **CRITICAL:** Needed to provide the 50% government matching for pilot deployment costs.

## Application Tracker

| Program | Target Amount | Priority | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **IRAP** | $100K-$200K | HIGH | 🔴 Not started |
| **ERA** | $100K-$200K | HIGH (Matching Source) | 🔴 Monitoring for calls |
| **Alberta Innovates** | $150K-$300K | HIGH (Matching Source) | 🔴 Not started |
| **COSIA** | $100K-$300K | HIGH (Industry Validation) | 🔴 Need mentor intro |
| **Operator Co-Funding** | $50K-$150K per pilot | HIGH (Matching Source) | 🔴 Raise in pilot discussions |

**Recommendation:** Target **$2.5M** fundraise for strong 24-month runway. Non-dilutive strategy must scale up to secure approximately **$400K-$500K** in grant funding over 24 months to match operator contributions for the 4 planned pilots.
