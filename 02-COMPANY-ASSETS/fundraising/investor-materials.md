## Executive Summary (1-Page)

### Luminous BioSolutions: The Operating System for Water Release

**The Problem:**
Oil sands operators have 12-18 months to transition from Containment to Release. They are running massive treatment pilots but lack the feedback loops to validate them in time. Relying on slow lab data (HRMS) means they are **learning too slowly** to meet the 2027 regulatory deadline.

**The Solution:**
Luminous provides the **Operational Intelligence Infrastructure** that compresses 5 years of learning into 18 months. We combine **High-Frequency Biological Feedback** (The Eyes) with a **Relational Context Engine** (The Brain) to validate treatment performance in real-time.

**Proven Value (The Trojan Horse):**
Validated **$260K/year** operational efficiency at Imperial Kearl (payback < 6 months). This "Efficiency Wedge" pays for the system, while the platform builds the critical regulatory baseline.

**Technology Advantage:**
- **Biosensor:** TRL 8, field-proven, 3-panel toxicity screening.
- **Context Engine:** Proprietary "Multivariate Correlation" architecture that links Bio + Chem + Physics data (The Moat).
- **Trust Layer:** Immutable audit trails for regulatory verification.

**The Ask:**
**$2.5M CAD** pre-seed round.
**Use of Funds:** 70% Market Expansion (Deploying 4 pilots via Offsite Lab), 20% Product Hardening, 10% Ops.

**Why Now (The 18-Month Window):**
The regulatory clock is ticking. Operators *must* have a validated baseline before 2027. Luminous is the only infrastructure ready to deploy Q2 2026.

## Pitch Deck Outline (Selected Slides Updated)

### Slide 2: The "Complexity Gap"
**Visual:** Chaos of "Bio + Chem + Physics" variables vs. The Luminous "Central Nervous System."
**Key Points:**
- Operators are moving from Static Containment to Dynamic Release.
- Managing a living ecosystem requires correlating thousands of variables.
- Humans can't do it. Excel can't do it. **We do it.**

### Slide 5: The Technology (Bridge to Operations)
**Visual:** "Academic Pilots" (Left) -> "Luminous Bridge" -> "Daily Operations" (Right).
**Key Points:**
- **We Scale Your Science:** We operationalize decades of research.
- **Relational Context Engine:** Instantly links live sensor data to historical pilot reports.
- **Automated Correlation:** Finds the "Golden Recipe" for treatment optimization.

### Slide 7: Validated ROI (The Wedge)
**Visual:** 5 Operational Scenarios (Kearl Data).
**Key Points:**
- **$260K/year savings** (The Safe Bet).
- **Real Value:** Speed. We proved recovery in 7 days vs. 14 days.
- **Result:** Faster learning cycles for the critical 18-month experiment.

### Slide 12: The Ask ($2.5M Strategic Buffer)
**Visual:** Timeline showing Pilot Deployment *independent* of Grant Cycles.
**Key Points:**
- **Raising:** **$2.5M CAD** (Scenario B).
- **Why $2.5M?:** To secure the "Offsite Lab" model. We bypass site access delays and scale immediately.
- **Milestone:** 4 Active Pilots + Regulatory Baseline secured before 2027.
