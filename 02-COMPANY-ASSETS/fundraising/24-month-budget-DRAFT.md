# 24-Month Budget (DRAFT)

**Status:** Draft - For mentor validation (Nov 27)
**Last Updated:** 2025-11-17
**Purpose:** Validate $2M-$2.5M pre-seed target and 24-month runway

---

## Executive Summary

**Fundraising Target:** $2M-$2.5M CAD
**Timeline:** 24 months (Q1 2026 - Q4 2027)
**Key Assumption:** Pilot personnel + consumables 100% covered by ERA/Alberta Innovates + operator co-funding (1-for-1 matching)

**CORRECTED ALLOCATION:**
- Total 24-month personnel: $2,245K-$2,755K
  - **Core operations:** $1,465K-$1,788K (Luminous pays from raise)
  - **Pilot work:** $780K-$967K (100% matched - not counted in burn)
- Other expenses (CAPEX, ops, marketing, R&D): $393K-$560K
- **Total Luminous burn:** $1,858K-$2,348K
- **Less Year 2 revenue:** ($132K-$206K)
- **Net 24-month burn:** $1,726K-$2,142K

**$2M Raise (less $82.5K Jeff payment = $1,917.5K available):**
- Best case: $191K cushion (10% buffer)
- Worst case: $216K shortfall ⚠️

**$2.5M Raise (less $82.5K Jeff payment = $2,417.5K available):**
- **Cushion: $275K-$692K (13-29% buffer) ✅**

**RECOMMENDATION:** Target $2.5M for comfortable 24-month runway. $2M is viable but requires tight cost management.

## Year 1 (2026): Pilot Deployment Phase

### Personnel Cost Allocation ($503K-$613K Luminous | $420K-$530K Pilot-Matched)

**ALLOCATION METHODOLOGY:**
Personnel costs are split between:
1. **Core Operations:** Funded by Luminous fundraising capital
2. **Pilot Delivery:** Funded by ERA/Alberta Innovates (50%) + CNRL (50%) matching

**YEAR 1 PERSONNEL SUMMARY:**
- **Luminous Pays (Core Operations):** $644K-$782K
- **Pilot Matching Covers:** $302K-$375K (ERA/AI 50% + CNRL 50%)

---

### Pilot Deployment Costs ($302K-$375K Total - 100% Matched)

**CNRL Albian Pilot** (Q2 2026, 9 months):
- Pilot-allocated personnel: $189K-$235K (see allocation table above)
- Lab consumables, shipping, equipment: $50K-$65K
- **Total CNRL Pilot Cost:** $239K-$300K
- **Matched 50/50:** ERA/Alberta Innovates $120K-$150K + CNRL $120K-$150K
- **Luminous net cost: $0**

**Pilot #2** (Q4 2026, 3 months):
- Pilot-allocated personnel: $63K-$78K
- Lab consumables, shipping, equipment: $12K-$18K
- **Total Pilot #2 Cost:** $75K-$96K
- **Matched 50/50:** ERA/Alberta Innovates $38K-$48K + Operator $38K-$48K
- **Luminous net cost: $0**

**TOTAL PILOT COSTS (Year 1):** $314K-$396K (100% matched by grants + operators)

**CRITICAL ASSUMPTION:** ERA/Alberta Innovates + operator 1-for-1 matching MUST be validated. If matching falls through, Luminous would need to add $302K-$375K personnel + $62K-$83K consumables = $364K-$458K to Year 1 burn.

### Year 2 Summary

| Category | Amount |
|----------|--------|
| Personnel (Core Operations) | $821K-$1,006K |
| Pilot Deployment (Matched) | $0 |
| CAPEX | $50K-$80K |
| Operations | $90K-$110K |
| Marketing & Sales | $40K-$60K |
| R&D | $15K-$25K |
| **TOTAL YEAR 2 BURN** | **$1,016K-$1,281K** |
| **Less Revenue** | **($132K-$206K)** |
| **NET YEAR 2 BURN** | **$810K-$1,149K** |

**PERSONNEL BREAKDOWN:**
- Luminous pays (core operations): $821K-$1,006K
- Pilot matching covers: $478K-$592K (not counted in Luminous burn)

**REVENUE ASSUMPTIONS:**

## 24-Month Runway Analysis

### Scenario A: $2M Raised

**Available Capital:**
- $2M fundraise
- Less: Jeff sweat equity ($82.5K)
- **Net available:** $1,917.5K

**24-Month Net Burn (CORRECTED):** $1,726K-$2,142K
- Best case: $1,917.5K - $1,726K = **$191K cushion (10% buffer)** ✅
- Worst case: $1,917.5K - $2,142K = **$216K shortfall** 🔴

**At $10M pre-money: $2M = 16.7% dilution**

**Result: VIABLE but requires tight cost management. Risk if any assumptions slip (pilot matching, revenue timing, hiring delays).**

---

### Scenario B: $2.5M Raised (RECOMMENDED)

**Available Capital:**
- $2.5M fundraise
- Less: Jeff sweat equity ($82.5K)
- **Net available:** $2,417.5K

**24-Month Net Burn (CORRECTED):** $1,726K-$2,142K
- Best case: $2,417.5K - $1,726K = **$692K cushion (29% buffer)** ✅
- Worst case: $2,417.5K - $2,142K = **$275K cushion (13% buffer)** ✅

**At $10M pre-money: $2.5M = 20% dilution**

**Result: STRONG 24-month runway with healthy buffer for:**
- Pilot matching delays
- Revenue timing slippage
- Unforeseen hiring or infrastructure costs
- Competitive positioning (Series A negotiations)

---

## Revenue Assumptions

| Pilot | Year 1 | Year 2 Subscription |
|-------|--------|-------------------|
| CNRL Albian | $0 (matched) | $48K-$75K |
| Pilot #2 | $0 (matched) | $48K-$75K |
| Pilot #3 | N/A | $36K-$56K (9 months) |
| Pilot #4 | N/A | $0 (too early) |
| **TOTAL** | **$0** | **$132K-$206K** |

---

## Mentor Validation Questions (Nov 27)

1. **Fundraise Amount:** Should we target $2.5M (20% dilution) instead of $2M (16.7%) to ensure runway?

2. **Pilot Matching:** Is ERA/Alberta Innovates 1-for-1 matching realistic for 4 pilots ($1,040K total Year 2)?

3. **Headcount:** Is 11-12 FTEs realistic for 3-4 active pilots, or over-staffed?

4. **Contract Strategy:** Keep Intermediate Dev, Field Eng #2, PM as contract Year 1-2 for flexibility?

5. **Revenue:** Is $48K-$75K/year subscription post-pilot realistic, or price higher?

---

## Next Steps

1. **Validate Pilot Matching** (URGENT - Week 1)
   Confirm ERA/Alberta Innovates capacity for 4 pilots

2. **Mentor Call** (Nov 27)
   Decide: $2M vs. $2.5M target

3. **Finalize Budget** (Week 4)
   Create final version with mentor-validated assumptions

---

**Status:** Updated with personnel details - IDENTIFIED $2.5M target needed (not $2M)
**Owner:** Jeff Violo
**Next Update:** Post-Nov 27 mentor validation
