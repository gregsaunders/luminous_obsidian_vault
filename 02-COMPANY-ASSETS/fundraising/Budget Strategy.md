# 24-Month Budget Strategy: The Strategic Buffer

Version: 3.0 (Target Locked: $2.5M)

Date: November 19, 2025

Status: DRAFT - Mentor Review Ready

## 1. Executive Summary

Fundraising Target: $2.5M CAD

Runway: 24 Months (Q1 2026 - Q4 2027)

Burn Strategy: Leveraged Growth (Matching Funds + Zero Friction Deployment)

We have selected the **$2.5M Target** (vs. $2.0M) to create a **Strategic Buffer**. This ensures Luminous retains full operational control even if government grant matching cycles (ERA/Alberta Innovates) are delayed. It transforms our runway from "Viable" to "Antifragile."

## 2. The "Use of Funds" Allocation

We prioritize Commercial Execution over R&D.

### A. Total Raise: $2.5M

- **Less Founder Settlement:** ($82.5k) - Sweat equity settlement.
    
- **Net Available Capital:** **$2,417,500**
    

### B. Allocation Breakdown

1. **Commercial Operations (70%):**
    
    - Scaling the **Offsite Lab** in Calgary (Staff + Equipment).
        
    - Sales & Account Management for CNRL/Suncor pilots.
        
    - Field Engineering (transitioning to Customer Success).
        
2. **Product Infrastructure (20%):**
    
    - **Relational Context Engine** hardening (Security/Air-Gap features).
        
    - Biosensor supply chain ruggedization.
        
3. **Operations & IP (10%):**
    
    - Patent defense and legal.
        
    - Working capital/Office.
        

## 3. The Strategic Buffer Defence

Investors will ask: "Why $2.5M? Why not lean out at $1.5M?"

The Answer: We are buying speed and independence.

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Risk Factor**|**The $1.5M Scenario (Lean)**|**The $2.5M Scenario (Strategic)**|
|**Grant Delays**|If ERA delays 4 months, we pause pilots.|We float the pilots on balance sheet. Speed is maintained.|
|**Pilot Friction**|We rely on site access (slow).|We fund the **Offsite Lab** immediately. Revenue starts day 1.|
|**Hiring**|We hire contractors (risk of churn).|We hire Key FTEs (CSO/CTO) to lock in IP.|
|**Runway End**|18 Months (Desperation Raise).|24 Months + Buffer (Series A from strength).|

**Conclusion:** The extra dilution (~3-4%) is cheap insurance to guarantee we hit the 2027 regulatory window without pausing for cash flow.

## 4. Pilot Economics: The Leveraged Model

Our budget assumes a **Leveraged Co-Funding Model** for pilot costs, but the $2.5M raise protects us if this leverage slips.

- **Pilot Cost Structure:**
    
    - Total cost per pilot (9 months): ~$300k.
        
    - **Target Split:** 50% Operator Cash / 50% ERA Match.
        
    - **Luminous Net Cost:** $0 (pass-through).
        
- **The "Plan B" (Funded by the Buffer):**
    
    - If matching fails, Luminous can self-fund the "Offsite Lab" portion of the pilot using the raise capital, ensuring we secure the customer data regardless of grant status.
        

## 5. The SaaS Transition (Headcount Evolution)

This budget reflects the transition from Service to Software.

**Year 1 (Deployment):**

- High allocation to **Lab Technicians** and **Field Engineers**.
    
- Focus: Manual sample processing and data correlation.
    

**Year 2 (Scale):**

- Headcount shifts to **Software Developers** and **Account Managers**.
    
- Focus: Automating the Relational Context Engine.
    
- _Note:_ Lab throughput increases 10x via automation, requiring fewer techs per dollar of revenue.
    

## 6. Mentor Validation Checklist (Nov 27)

- [ ] **Valuation:** Is $10M Pre-Money defensible given the "Operator Premium" (TRL 8 on <$150k)?
    
- [ ] **The Buffer:** Does the mentor agree that "Grant Delay Risk" justifies the larger raise?
    
- [ ] **SaaS Narrative:** Is the Year 1 -> Year 3 margin transition clear in the budget lines?
