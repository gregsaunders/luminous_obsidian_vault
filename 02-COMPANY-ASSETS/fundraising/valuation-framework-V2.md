# Valuation Framework: Luminous BioSolutions (Pre-Seed)

Status: Strategic Draft for Mentor Review

Target Raise: $2.5M CAD (The "Strategic Buffer" Scenario)

Valuation Target: $8M - $10M Pre-Money

## 1. The Core Thesis: Why We Command a Premium

Most pre-seed startups ask investors to fund R&D Risk ("Will it work?").

Luminous is asking investors to fund Market Expansion of a proven platform.

We justify a premium valuation based on three defensible pillars:

### Pillar A: Extreme Capital Efficiency (The "Operator" Premium)

- **Typical CleanTech:** Burns $3M-$5M to reach TRL 7.
    
- **Luminous Achievement:** Reached **TRL 8** (Multi-season field validation) on **<$150k** of hard capital.
    
- **The Signal:** We are elite operators. $2.5M in our hands generates the output of $10M in a typical startup. We don't burn cash; we convert it into assets.
    

### Pillar B: The Regulatory Moat (The "Timing" Premium)

- **The Deadline:** The AER Water Release Guidelines (expected 2027) create a hard deadline.
    
- **The Scarcity:** Operators need 12-18 months of baseline data **before** 2027 to apply for release.
    
- **The Monopoly:** Luminous is the only **Readiness Infrastructure** ready to deploy in Q2 2026.
    
- **The Lock-in:** Once an operator starts building their baseline on our system, switching costs become prohibitive.
    

### Pillar C: Validated Unit Economics (The "Business" Premium)

We are not searching for a business model. We have validated it.

- **Proven ROI:** $260k/year validated operational savings (Kearl data).
    
- **Payback Period:** 5.0 months.
    
- **Pricing Power:** We aren't selling a commodity sensor; we are selling the **"License to Release."**
    

## 2. Investment to Date (The Foundation)

We successfully bootstrapped to Field Validation.

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Asset**|**Status**|**Value Driver**|
|**Biosensor Tech**|**TRL 8 (Field Validated)**|3-Panel System validated across multiple operational seasons at Imperial Kearl. High correlation with HRMS.|
|**Confluent Platform**|**Deployed (MVP)**|Relational Context Engine operational. Ingests Biosensor + SCADA + Historical PDFs.|
|**Customer Traction**|**Advanced Pipeline**|Imperial Kearl (Completed Pilot). CNRL Albian (Q2 2026 Planned). Suncor (Engagement initiated).|
|**Founder Equity**|**Full Commitment**|Founders have invested 18 months of effort to de-risk the tech before asking for outside capital.|

## 3. Valuation Benchmarks & Scenarios

Positioning Luminous as a "Late-Seed" asset in a "Pre-Seed" round.

**The Narrative: "The De-Risked Scale Play"**

- **Valuation Range:** $8M - $10M Pre-Money.
    
- **Dilution:** ~20% for $2.5M.
    
- **Why:** Investors get TRL 8 tech without paying for the R&D failure risk. They are funding the **Commercial Expansion** (Sales/Deployment), not the Science.
    

## 4. Use of Funds: Market Expansion (Not R&D)

Total Raise: $2.5M CAD

Goal: 24-Month Runway (Strategic Buffer against Grant Delays).

- **70% Market Expansion ($1.7M):** Deploy 3-4 Pilots (CNRL, Suncor) via "Offsite Lab" model. Scale Commercial/Field Operations team.
    
- **20% Product Hardening ($500k):** Ruggedize Biosensor supply chain. Enhance Relational Context Engine security.
    
- **10% Operations ($300k):** Legal, IP protection, Working Capital.
    

## 5. Cap Table Strategy (Clean & Founder-Friendly)

**Current Structure:**

- Founders: ~90% Ownership.
    
- Debt: ~$40k (Confluent Expenses).
    

**Proposed Deal Structure:**

- **Convertible Note for Expenses:** Convert the ~$40k debt into equity at the same terms as new investors.
    
- **Founder Vesting:** Standard 4-year vesting with 1-year cliff (resets clock, signals commitment).
    
- **Option Pool:** Create 10% post-money option pool for key hires.
    

**Post-Money Ownership Target:**

- Founders: ~60-65%
    
- Investors: ~20-25%
    
- Option Pool: ~10%
    

## 6. Mentor Validation Questions (Nov 27)

- **Valuation Check:** Does the combination of TRL 8 + Capital Efficiency justify an $8M-$10M floor?
    
- **The Buffer:** Is the argument that "We raised $2.5M to survive Grant Delays" a sign of strength or weakness?
    
- **SaaS Transition:** Is the path from "Field Services" (Year 1) to "SaaS Margins" (Year 3) credible?
