## Core Valuation Thesis: TRL 7-8 De-Risked Technology

### Why This Matters

**Traditional Early-Stage Startup:**
- Investors fund R&D risk (will the tech work?)
- Market risk (will customers buy?)
- Execution risk (can the team deliver?)
- **Typical Valuation:** $2M-$5M pre-money

**Luminous Position:**
- ✅ **Technology risk DE-RISKED:** TRL 7-8, proven with customer data
- 🔴 **Market risk REMAINING:** Will operators deploy and pay?
- 🔴 **Execution risk REMAINING:** Can we scale to 3-4 sites?
- **Justified Valuation:** $7M-$10M pre-money (HYPOTHESIS - needs mentor validation)

**Investor Value Proposition:**
"You're not funding technology development. You're funding **market expansion of proven technology**. We've already invested $[TBD] to reach TRL 7-8. You're buying de-risked execution."

**Total Founder Sweat Equity:** $242K-$306K

---

### Total De-Risked Investment to Reach TRL 8

**Capital + Sweat Equity:** $524K-$918K (using midpoint: ~$720K)

**Investor Value Proposition:**
"We've invested ~$720K (capital + foregone salaries + academic R&D) to reach TRL 8 with multi-season field validation. You're buying proven technology at a 14-17x multiple on de-risked R&D investment."

---

### IP & Technology Developed

**Biosensor Technology:**
- 3-panel system (atuA, marR, p3680) developed and validated
- 92% OSPW success rate, R > 0.9 HRMS correlation
- 24-72 hour results (vs. 2-4 weeks HRMS)
- **Multi-season field validation:** Imperial Kearl wetland pilot across multiple operational seasons (not single 98-day snapshot)

**Confluent Platform:**
- AI-native architecture (TerminusDB graph database)
- Model-agnostic orchestration (Claude, GPT-4, specialized models)
- Unified structured + unstructured data (biosensor + PDFs + SCADA + weather)
- Natural language query interface
- Automated correlation and pattern matching

**Operational Intelligence Framework:**
- 5 operational scenarios documented with quantified value ($260K/year)
- 95-99% time-to-decision reduction proven
- Integration thesis validated (biosensor + Confluent > sum of parts)

**Customer Validation:**
- **Imperial Kearl:** Multi-season wetland pilot participation, field-validated across seasonal operational cycles
- **CNRL:** Pilot discussions advanced (Q2 2026 deployment target)
- **Suncor:** Potential engagement (via Michael Lipsett mentor connection)

---

## TRL Status Validation

### Current TRL Assessment

**Biosensor (TRL 8):**
- **TRL 7:** System prototype demonstrated in operational environment
  - ✅ Analyzed field samples from Imperial Kearl operational wetland across MULTIPLE SEASONS
  - ✅ Performance validated in real-world conditions (not lab-only)
- **TRL 8:** System complete and qualified through test and demonstration
  - ✅ Multi-season validation = repeated demonstration across varied operational conditions
  - 🔴 Not yet deployed on-site (lab-based analysis), but field-validated repeatedly

**Current Status: TRL 8** (multi-season field validation qualifies as "system complete and qualified through test and demonstration")

**Confluent Platform (TRL 6-7):**
- **TRL 6:** System/subsystem model or prototype demonstrated in relevant environment
  - 🔴 Functional platform with real Kearl data
  - ✅ Natural language queries generating operational insights
- 🔴**TRL 7:** System prototype demonstrated in operational environment
  -  Requires operator using platform for real decisions to achieve

**Current Status: TRL 6-7** (functional with real data, not yet driving operational decisions)

**Integrated System (TRL 7-8):**
- Biosensor (TRL 8) + Confluent (TRL 6-7) validated with multi-season Kearl field data
- Operational scenarios documented showing decision-making value ($260K/year proven ROI)
- Ready for commercial pilot deployment

---

### What TRL 8 De-Risks for Investors

**Technology Risk: HEAVILY DE-RISKED**
- Biosensor works across multiple operational seasons (not single trial)
- R > 0.9 correlation with gold standard HRMS (repeatably validated)
- Confluent platform functional (generates insights from real operator data)
- Integration proven (95-99% time-to-decision reduction, $260K/year quantified value)

**Remaining Risk: MARKET & EXECUTION (NOT TECHNOLOGY)**
- Will operators deploy and pay? (CNRL pilot discussions advanced - strong signal)
- Can we scale to 3-4 sites simultaneously? (Team/execution risk)
- Will pilots convert to subscriptions? (Commercial model risk)

**Investor Pitch:**
"We've solved the hard technology problem with ~$720K invested (capital + sweat equity + academic R&D). Multi-season field validation proves repeatability. You're funding commercial scale-up, not R&D risk."

## Valuation Scenarios

### Scenario A: Pre-Pilot Signature (NOW - Dec 2025)

**What We Have:**
- **TRL 8 technology** with multi-season field validation (not single trial)
- Confluent investment: ~$100K capital + $36K-$45K expenses owed
- Jeff/Greg/Shawn sweat equity: ~$240K-$300K foregone salaries
- **Total de-risked investment: ~$720K**
- CNRL pilot discussions advanced (not signed)
- $260K ROI validated from Kearl data
- Competitive moat documented (2-3 year barrier to entry)

**Comparable Valuation:**
- Clean tech with TRL 8 + field validation: $8M-$12M pre-money
- Multi-season validation + ~$720K invested = later-stage positioning

**Realistic Pre-Money Valuation:** $10M-$12M
- $2M raise → 14.3-16.7% dilution

**Pros:** Capital in hand ($2M = 24-month runway), strong valuation defense
**Cons:** Pre-revenue (no paying customer yet)

---

### Scenario B: Post-Pilot Signature (Q2 2026)

**What We Have:**
- TRL 8 technology with multi-season validation
- CNRL pilot agreement signed ($260K pilot revenue Year 1, matched by ERA/Alberta Innovates)
- Deployment starting
- **Paying customer = revenue traction + market validation**

**Comparable Valuation:**
- Pre-revenue → early revenue transition: $12M-$15M pre-money
- Paying customer + pilot matching (ERA/AI) = strong operator + government validation

**Realistic Pre-Money Valuation:** $12M-$15M
- $2M raise → 11.8-14.3% dilution

**Pros:** Lower dilution, paying customer proof point
**Cons:** Burns 6 months runway before raising (may need bridge if pilot delays)

---

### Scenario C: Post-Pilot Success (Q4 2026)

**What We Have:**
- TRL 8 technology (deployed and demonstrating value for 6 months)
- $260K pilot revenue + $48K-$75K subscription ARR from CNRL
- 2nd pilot in advanced discussions or deployed
- Proven commercial model (pilot → subscription pathway validated)

**Comparable Valuation:**
- Early revenue with proven model: $15M-$25M pre-money
- Multiple customer traction + subscription conversions = strong commercial validation

**Realistic Pre-Money Valuation:** $18M-$25M
- $2M raise → 7.4-10% dilution

**Pros:** Lowest dilution, highest valuation, proven commercial model
**Cons:** Runway critically low (may need bridge), execution risk high (must deliver pilot success)

---

## Capital Efficiency Story

### Bootstrapped to TRL 8 (Competitive Advantage)

**Comparable Startups:**
- Typical clean tech raises $3M-$5M seed to reach TRL 6-7
- Often 10+ person teams, high burn rate ($200K-$500K/month)
- Single-season validation, lab-focused testing

**Luminous:**
- Bootstrapped to **TRL 8** on ~$720K invested capital (Confluent $100K + expenses $40K + sweat equity $240K-$300K + Shawn's academic R&D $200K-$500K)
- Lean team (3 co-founders, minimal burn: $7.5K/month baseline)
- **Multi-season field validation** (not single trial)
- Customer validation achieved without sales team (operator relationships from academic work)

**Valuation Argument:**
"We've proven we can execute efficiently. ~$720K got us to TRL 8 with multi-season validation - competitors spend $3M-$5M to reach TRL 6-7. $2M goes 10-15x farther with this team than typical early-stage burn rate."

## Cap Table Structure & Equity Management

### Current Ownership (Pre-Fundraise):

- **Lewenza Labs (Shawn Lewenza):** 51%
- **Confluent (Greg Saunders + Jeff Violo):** 49%
  - Jeff Violo personal equity allocation: ~24.5%
  - Greg Saunders: ~24.5%

**Confluent Debt Structure:**
- Expenses owed: $36K-$45K (rent, hardware, software, operational costs)
- **RECOMMENDATION:** Convert to convertible note at fundraise (same terms as new investors)
- **Why:** Preserves cash, aligns Confluent with investor risk, clean cap table

---

### Founder Compensation Agreements (Pre-Fundraise):

**Jeff Violo 12-Month Sweat Equity:**
- Full-time COO work: $165K market value (12 months × $150K-$180K midpoint)
- **Structure:** 50% cash / 50% equity
  - **Cash payment:** $82.5K (paid at fundraise closing from proceeds)
  - **Equity grant:** $82.5K value at $10M pre-money = 0.825% additional equity
- **Vesting:** Equity grants immediately (or 2-year vest with 6-month cliff if investors prefer)

---

### Post-Fundraise Cap Table (Scenario A: $2M at $10M Pre-Money)

**Pre-Fundraise Adjustments:**
1. Jeff sweat equity: +0.825% (carved from Confluent's 49% → Jeff gets 25.325%, Greg gets 23.675%)
2. Confluent convertible note: $40K converts at $10M = 0.4%

**Post-Fundraise (Before ESOP):**
- Lewenza Labs: 51% × (1 - 0.167) = **42.5%**
- Greg Saunders: 23.675% × (1 - 0.167) = **19.7%**
- Jeff Violo: 25.325% × (1 - 0.167) = **21.1%**
- Confluent Note (converted): 0.4% × (1 - 0.167) = **0.3%**
- **New Investors:** **16.7%** ($2M at $10M pre-money)

**Founders Retain: 83.6% (excellent position)**

---

### Employee Stock Option Pool (ESOP)

**Recommendation:** 10% option pool (industry standard for early-stage tech)

**Post-ESOP Cap Table ($2M at $10M pre-money with 10% ESOP):**
- Lewenza Labs: 42.5% × 0.9 = **38.3%**
- Greg Saunders: 19.7% × 0.9 = **17.7%**
- Jeff Violo: 21.1% × 0.9 = **19.0%**
- Confluent Note: 0.3% × 0.9 = **0.3%**
- New Investors: 16.7% × 0.9 = **15.0%**
- **ESOP Pool:** **10%**

**Founders Retain: 75.3% post-raise with option pool - STRONG**

## Mentor Validation Questions (Nov 27)

### For Terence Tham / Dave Lee (Commercial Strategy):

1. **Valuation Reality Check:**
   - Is $10M-$12M pre-money defensible for TRL 8 + multi-season validation but pre-revenue?
   - What do clean tech / SaaS companies at similar stage actually raise at?

2. **Timing Strategy:**
   - Should we raise NOW at $10M-$12M (16.7% dilution for $2M)?
   - Or bootstrap to pilot signature and raise at $12M-$15M (lower dilution, tighter runway)?

3. **Cap Table Structure:**
   - Is Confluent convertible note ($40K converting at same terms) clean approach?
   - Is Jeff's 50/50 cash/equity structure ($82.5K cash + 0.825% equity) reasonable for 12 months full-time work?
   - Is 10% ESOP sufficient for 5-7 key hires over 24 months?

### For Jocelyn McMinn / Doug Beach (Operator Context):

1. **Market De-Risking:**
   - Does TRL 8 with multi-season field validation meaningfully de-risk adoption for operators?
   - Would operators view us differently than early-stage tech (more credible, worth paying for)?

2. **Pilot Matching:**
   - Is 1-for-1 matching (ERA/Alberta Innovates + CNRL) realistic for $260K pilot cost?
   - Does this structure (operator + government co-funding) strengthen investor confidence?

---
