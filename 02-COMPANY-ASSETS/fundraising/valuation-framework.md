# Valuation Framework: Luminous BioSolutions (Pre-Seed)

**Status:** Strategic Draft for Mentor Review
**Target Raise:** $1.5M - $2.0M CAD
**Valuation Target:** $8M - $10M Pre-Money

## 1. The Core Thesis: Why We Command a Premium
Most pre-seed startups ask investors to fund **R&D Risk** (Will it work?).
Luminous is asking investors to fund **Market Expansion** of a proven platform.

We justify a premium valuation based on three defensible pillars:

### Pillar A: Extreme Capital Efficiency (The "Operator" Premium)
Typical CleanTech startups burn $3M-$5M to reach TRL 7.
* **Luminous Achievement:** Reached **TRL 8** (Multi-season field validation) on **<$150k of hard capital.**
* **The Signal:** We are elite operators. $1.5M in our hands generates the output of $5M in a typical startup. We don't burn cash; we convert it into assets.

### Pillar B: The Regulatory Moat (The "Timing" Premium)
The AER Water Release Guidelines (expected 2027) create a hard deadline for operators.
* **The Scarcity:** Operators need 12-18 months of baseline data *before* 2027 to apply for release.
* **The Monopoly:** Luminous is the only **Readiness Infrastructure** ready to deploy in Q2 2026.
* **The Lock-in:** Once an operator starts building their baseline on our graph, switching costs become prohibitive.

### Pillar C: Validated Unit Economics (The "Business" Premium)
We are not searching for a business model. We have validated it.
* **Proven ROI:** $260k/year validated operational savings (Kearl data).
* **Payback Period:** 5.0 months.
* **Pricing Power:** We aren't selling a commodity sensor; we are selling the "License to Release."

| :--------------------- | :-------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Biosensor Tech**     | **TRL 8 (Field Validated)** | 3-Panel System validated across multiple operational seasons at Imperial Kearl. High correlation with HRMS.                                     |
| **Confluent Platform** | **Deployed (MVP)**          | Infrastructure operational. Ingests Biosensor + SCADA + Historical PDFs. Integration thesis validated.                                          |
| **Customer Traction**  | **Advanced Pipeline**       | Imperial Kearl (Completed Pilot). CNRL Albian (Q2 2026 Planned). Suncor (Engagement initiated). Pathways Alliance (Engagement Initiated)        |
| **Founder Equity**     | **Full Commitment**         | Founders have invested 18 months of full-time/part-time effort (>$300k opportunity cost) to de-risk the tech before asking for outside capital. |

## 3. Valuation Benchmarks & Scenarios
*Positioning Luminous as a "Late-Seed" asset in a "Pre-Seed" round.*

### Scenario A: The "De-Risked Tech" Play (Current Status)
**Narrative:** "Technology is proven. Customer is engaged. You are funding the deployment."
* **Comparable:** Post-R&D CleanTech with TRL 8 hardware + software component.
* **Valuation Range:** **$8M - $10M Pre-Money.**
* **Dilution:** 15% - 20% for $2M.
* **Why:** Investors get TRL 8 tech without paying for the R&D failure risk.

### Scenario B: The "Revenue Traction" Play (Post-Pilot Sign)
**Narrative:** "Paying customer secured. Pilot matching funded. You are funding scaling."
* **Milestone:** CNRL contract signed + ERA Matching secured.
* **Valuation Range:** **$12M - $15M Pre-Money.**
* **Risk:** Requires bridging 4-6 months of runway to get signature.
* **Why:** Commercial validation justifies SaaS-like multiples on projected revenue.

**Recommendation:** Raise **NOW** at **Scenario A ($8M-$10M)**.
* Ensures 24-month runway to execute the CNRL pilot without desperation.
* Captures the "First Mover" window for the 2027 Regulatory Guidelines.

## 4. Use of Funds: Market Expansion (Not R&D)
*Investors prefer funding Sales over Science.*

**Total Raise:** $2.0M CAD
* **70% Market Expansion ($1.4M):**
    * Deploy 3-4 Pilots (CNRL, Suncor, etc.).
    * Build "Readiness Infrastructure" at sites.
    * Scale Commercial/Field Operations team.
* **20% Product Hardening ($400k):**
    * Ruggedize Biosensor supply chain.
    * Enhance Confluent "Automated Correlation" features.
* **10% Operations ($200k):**
    * Legal, IP protection, Working Capital.

## 5. Cap Table Strategy (Clean & Founder-Friendly)
**Current Structure:**
* **Founders:** ~90% Ownership (Lewenza Labs + Confluent).
* **Debt:** ~$40k (Confluent Expenses).

**Proposed Deal Structure:**
1.  **Convertible Note for Expenses:** Convert the ~$40k Confluent debt into equity at the same terms as new investors. (Keeps cap table clean, aligns founders with investors).
2.  **Founder Vesting:** Standard 4-year vesting with 1-year cliff for key founders (resets clock, signals long-term commitment to investors).
3.  **Option Pool:** Create 10% post-money option pool for key hires (Field Engineers, Sales Lead).

**Post-Money Ownership Target:**
* **Founders:** ~65-70%
* **Investors:** ~20%
* **Option Pool:** ~10%

## 6. Mentor Validation Questions (Nov 27)

1.  **Valuation Check:** Does the combination of **TRL 8** + **Capital Efficiency** justify an $8M-$10M floor in the current Alberta market?
2.  **The "Readiness" Moat:** Is the argument that "We are the only infrastructure for 2027 Compliance" strong enough to drive FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out)?
3.  **Raise Amount:** Is $2M the right number to secure 24 months of runway (given the pilot matching leverage), or should we target $1.5M to be safe?
