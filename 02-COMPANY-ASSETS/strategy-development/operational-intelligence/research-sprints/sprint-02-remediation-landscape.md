# Research Sprint 2: The Validated Wedge ($260k ROI)

Sprint ID: Sprint-02

Status: ✅ VALIDATED (Kearl Data)

Owner: Jeff Violo

Context: The "Gold Standard" Case Study. This document deconstructs the Imperial Kearl Wetland Pilot to prove exactly where money is being left on the table.

## The Core Argument: The "Resolution Gap"

The Imperial Kearl Pilot revealed why the industry is stuck. Operators are forced to choose between technologies that are either **Fast but Blind** or **Precise but Slow**.

- **The FTIR Failure (Lack of Specificity):** FTIR is fast, but it suffers from "Resolution Collapse." It detects generic carbon bonds, meaning it cannot distinguish between _toxic_ Naphthenic Acids and _safe_ background organics (like fatty acids). **Result:** You treat water that is already safe because the sensor can't tell the difference.
    
- **The HRMS Failure (Lack of Frequency):** HRMS is precise (Gold Standard), but takes 45 days to return data. **Result:** You are driving looking in the rear-view mirror.
    
- **The Luminous Delta:** We provide **HRMS-level Specificity** (Panel 2 Toxicity) at **FTIR-level Speed** (Daily). We turn "Safety Factors" into "Capacity."
    

## The 5 Operational Scenarios (Deconstructed)

_Analysis based on actual 2021-2022 Kearl Wetland performance data._

### 1. Seasonal Operating Strategy (The "Warm Days" Waste)

The Kearl Reality (What Happened):

The operator shut down the system on September 15th based on a conservative calendar schedule. However, water temperatures remained biologically active (>5°C) well into October.

The Luminous Advantage (The Fix):

Our Relational Context Engine correlates NAFC reduction rates directly with Water Temperature, not calendar dates. The data proves that treatment efficiency remains high until 5°C.

- **The Win:** We extend the operating window by **21 days (3 weeks)** based on actual biological data.
    
- **ROI Value:** **$104,000/year** in additional treatment capacity (Zero CAPEX).
    

### 2. Cell-Specific Optimization (The "Spatial" Blind Spot)

The Kearl Reality (What Happened):

The wetland consists of Deep Pools (1.7m) and Shallow Vegetated Cells (0.4m). Without granular data, the operator flowed water equally through both.

The Luminous Advantage (The Fix):

Our Spatial Resolution monitoring revealed a critical insight: Shallow Cells removed NAFCs 18% more efficiently than Deep Pools.

- **The Win:** By adjusting flow valves to route **60% more water** through the high-performance Shallow Cells, we increase total system throughput by **26%**.
    
- **ROI Value:** **$78,000/year** in efficiency gains.
    

### 3. Toxicity-Targeted Validation (The "Proxy" Play)

The Kearl Reality (What Happened):

The operator relied on expensive Microtox bio-assays ($8k/test) to prove safety because standard "Total NAFC" counts (via FTIR/Low-Res MS) didn't correlate with toxicity.

The Luminous Advantage (The Fix):

Our Panel 2 Biosensor specifically isolates the Toxic Fraction (O2-NAFCs). The Kearl data showed a strong correlation ($R^2 = 0.89$) between our Panel 2 signal and the actual toxicity reduction (which dropped 65% while Total NAs only dropped 36%).

- **The Win:** Use Panel 2 as a high-frequency proxy for safety. Reduce Microtox testing from Quarterly (4/yr) to Annual validation (1/yr).
    
- **ROI Value:** **$36,000/year** in direct lab cost savings.
    

### 4. Refill Impact Management (The "Recovery" Lag)

The Kearl Reality (What Happened):

When fresh water was added (refill event), the system was disturbed. The operator conservatively paused outflow for 14 days to ensure mixing and recovery.

The Luminous Advantage (The Fix):

Continuous monitoring showed that NAFC removal rates actually recovered to baseline in just 7 days.

- **The Win:** By watching the recovery in real-time, the operator can resume outflow **7 days earlier** per event.
    
- **ROI Value:** **$14,000/year** (assuming 2 refill events) in regained capacity.
    

### 5. Automated Regulatory Reporting (The "Admin" Drag)

The Kearl Reality (What Happened):

Environmental teams spent weeks manually collating SCADA logs, weather data, and Excel lab reports for AER submission.

The Luminous Advantage (The Fix):

The Readiness Infrastructure automatically aggregates these streams into a compliance-ready audit trail.

- **The Win:** Reduces reporting labor by 90%.
    
- **ROI Value:** **$28,000/year** (approx. 160 engineering hours).
    

## Total ROI Summary

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Metric**|**Value**|
|**Total Annual Savings**|**$260,000**|
|**Year 1 Cost (Pilot)**|**$130,000**|
|**Payback Period**|**5.0 Months**|

## The Closing Argument

**"Mr. Customer, at Kearl, the physics and biology were already doing the work. The water** _**could**_ **have been treated for 3 more weeks. The shallow cells** _**were**_ **working 18% better. But because the FTIR data lacked the specificity to see the toxicity, that value evaporated.**

**Luminous provides the resolution to capture the value that is already there."**
