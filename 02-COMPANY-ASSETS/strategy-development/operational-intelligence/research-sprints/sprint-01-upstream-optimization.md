# Research Sprint 2: The Validated Wedge ($260k ROI)

**Sprint ID:** Sprint-02
**Status:** ✅ VALIDATED (Kearl Data)
**Owner:** Jeff Violo
**Context:** This is our primary commercial asset. The "Safe Bet."

## The Core Argument

**Why Biosensors Alone Fail:**
* Data rich, insight poor.
* Operators get a spreadsheet of numbers and still don't know *what to do*.

**Why Confluent is Required:**
* It converts "55 mg/L" into "Normal Seasonal Variation - Do Not Intervene."
* It connects the dots between the number and the operational context (Weather/History).

## The 5 Validated Operational Scenarios

*Based on actual data from the Imperial Kearl Wetland Pilot.*

### 1. Seasonal Operating Strategy ($104k/year)
* **Context:** Operators use calendar dates (May 1 - Sept 30) to run pumps.
* **The Insight:** Biosensor data showed treatment remained effective well into October *if* temperatures stayed above 5°C.
* **The Value:** Extending the operating window by 3 weeks captures **16% more treatment capacity** for zero CAPEX.

### 2. Cell-Specific Optimization ($78k/year)
* **Context:** Wetlands have deep pools and shallow vegetated zones.
* **The Insight:** Spatial monitoring proved shallow cells outperformed deep pools by 18%.
* **The Value:** Adjusting flow valves to route 60% more water to shallow cells increases overall throughput by **26%**.

### 3. Toxicity-Targeted Validation ($36k/year)
* **Context:** Operators run expensive Microtox bio-assays ($8k) to prove safety.
* **The Insight:** Luminous Panel 2 (Complex NAs) correlates (R² = 0.89) with the toxic fraction (O2-NAFCs).
* **The Value:** Use Panel 2 as a high-frequency proxy. Reduce Microtox testing from Quarterly to Annual.

### 4. Refill Impact Management ($14k/year)
* **Context:** Adding fresh water disturbs the treatment process. Operators conservatively pause outflow for 14 days.
* **The Insight:** Continuous monitoring showed recovery actually happens in 7 days.
* **The Value:** Resuming outflow 7 days earlier saves **$8k** in capacity per event.

### 5. Automated Regulatory Reporting ($24k/year)
* **Context:** Environmental teams spend 40+ hours/quarter compiling data for the AER.
* **The Insight:** Confluent automates the data aggregation and audit trail.
* **The Value:** Reduces reporting labor by 90%.
