# Critical Assumptions Audit: The "Bullshit Detector"

**Document Purpose:** Prevents us from making unproven claims that destroy credibility with Ops Engineers.
**Date Created:** 2025-11-15
**Version:** 3.0 (Humble Confident Update)
**Status:** ✅ Active Guideline

## The Guardrails

**Rule #1: Kill the "Vendor Math" ($10M Claims)**
- **Verdict:** Claims of "15% Fresh Water Substitution" without site-specific data make us look naive.
- **Correction:** Move these to **"Joint Discovery Hypotheses"** (Tier 3). "We have a hypothesis that X is possible; let's test it together."

**Rule #2: The "AI" Trap -> The Complexity Solution**
- Engineers hate "AI" (Black Box). They respect "Correlation" (Math).
- **Verdict:** Stop selling "AI Orchestration."
- **Correction:** Sell **"Multivariate Correlation."** "The system handles the complexity of linking Bio + Chem + Physics that is too fast for manual analysis."

**Rule #3: The "Saviour" Trap (Respect the Expert)**
- **Verdict:** Never imply they are "flying blind" because they are incompetent. They are flying blind because the tools don't exist.
- **Correction:** "You have brilliant scientists and pilots. We provide the **Infrastructure** to scale that science to daily operations."

## Validated vs. Hypothesized Value

### ✅ Validated (The "Safe Bet")
*Lead with this.*
1.  **Speed of Learning:** Compressed recovery validation from 14 days to 7 days.
2.  **Time-to-Decision:** Reduction from 3 weeks (manual) to 10 minutes (automated).
3.  **Operational Efficiency:** $260k/year in specific optimizations (Kearl Data).

### 🟡 Hypothesized (The "Upside")
*Mention this as "Exploration."*
1.  **Caustic Savings:** Can we reduce dosing based on real-time toxicity? (Hypothesis).
2.  **Fresh Water Substitution:** Is Toxicity the limiting factor, or is it Chlorides? (Hypothesis).
3.  **Regulatory Trust:** Will the "Glass Box" audit trail actually speed up approval? (Hypothesis).

## Immediate Action Items
1.  **Validate Complexity Load:** Ask: "How many screens do you have open when making a release decision?"
2.  **Confirm Trust Deficit:** Ask: "How much time is spent just *proving* data to stakeholders?"
