# Critical Assumptions Audit: The "Bullshit Detector"

**Document Purpose:** Prevents us from making unproven claims that destroy credibility with Ops Engineers.
**Date Created:** 2025-11-15
**Version:** 2.1 (Trojan Horse Update)
**Status:** ✅ Active Guideline

## The Guardrails

**Rule #1: Kill the "Vendor Math" ($10M Claims)**
- We previously claimed $10M in savings based on "3-5% Caustic Reduction" and "15% Fresh Water Substitution."
- **Verdict:** This is dangerous. We have zero data to support these magnitudes. Claiming them makes us look naive.
- **Correction:** Move these to **"Discovery Hypotheses"** (Tier 3 Value). We invite them to *test* this, we do not *promise* it.

**Rule #2: The "AI" Trap**
- Engineers are cynical about "AI." They hear "Black Box."
- **Verdict:** Stop selling "AI Orchestration" and "Graph Databases."
- **Correction:** Sell **"Automated Correlation"** and **"Institutional Memory."**
    - *Bad:* "Our AI queries the graph to find insights."
    - *Good:* "The system automatically links today's spike to the weather event from Tuesday."

**Rule #3: The Multi-Contaminant Reality**
- Operators care about **Integrated Water Quality** (Chlorides, Metals, TDS), not just NAs.
- **Verdict:** Selling an "NA Platform" is insufficient for fresh water substitution.
- **Correction:** Confluent MUST be positioned to ingest *their existing* LIMS/SCADA data for Chlorides/Metals. We provide the NA piece; we integrate the rest.

## Validated vs. Hypothesized Value

### ✅ Validated (The "Safe Bet")
*Lead with this.*
1.  **Treatment Optimization:** $260k/year (Kearl Data).
2.  **Time-to-Decision:** Reduction from 8 weeks to 24 Hours.
3.  **Regulatory Baseline:** 12-month head start on 2027 guidelines.

### 🟡 Hypothesized (The "Upside")
*Mention this as "Exploration."*
1.  **Caustic Savings ($200k+):** Literature suggests it, but magnitude is unknown.
2.  **Fresh Water Substitution ($500k+):** Depends entirely on Chloride/Metal limits.
3.  **Tailings Flocculation ($100k+):** Does NA reduction actually help settling? Unproven.

## Immediate Action Items
1.  **Validate Caustic Hypothesis:** Ask Michael Lipsett (CDL) specifically about Suncor's experience with caustic vs. water quality.
2.  **Confirm Chloride Limits:** In Discovery Interviews, ask: "What is the *actual* limiting factor for fresh water substitution?"
