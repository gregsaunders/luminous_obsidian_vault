# Pilot Proposal: High-Frequency NAFC Monitoring & Optimization

Prepared For: [Operator Name]
Prepared By: Luminous BioSolutions
Date: November 21, 2025
Status: DRAFT v2.1

## 1. Executive Summary
**The Challenge:** You cannot optimize what you cannot measure. Currently, your feedback loop on NAFC toxicity—the primary barrier to release—is 4-8 weeks (HRMS). This forces you to operate conservatively, guessing at treatment performance.

**The Proposal:** Luminous BioSolutions deploys the industry's first **High-Frequency NAFC Biosensor**. We reduce your feedback loop from weeks to days, giving you the operational visibility to optimize flow, reduce retention times, and validate your pilots in real-time.

## 2. The Problem: The "Blind Spot"
Your treatment systems (wetlands, pit lakes) are dynamic biological ecosystems.
1.  **Too Slow:** Managing a daily process with monthly data is impossible.
2.  **Too Vague:** "Total NAs" doesn't tell you if the water is toxic.
3.  **Result:** You are flying blind through the critical 18-month release preparation window.

## 3. The Solution: Seeing the Invisible

### Part A: The Innovation – 3-Panel Biosensor (The "Mine Detector")
We provide the only field-validated technology capable of tracking NAFC toxicity at operational speed.
* **Speed:** **24-72 Hour Turnaround** (vs. 45 days for labs).
* **Resolution:** Our 3-Panel system isolates the **Toxic Fraction (Panel 2)**, filtering out the non-toxic background noise.
* **Deployment:** **Zero-Friction Offsite Lab.** You ship samples; we generate data. No site access needed.

### Part B: The Value Multiplier – Relational Context Engine
Raw data isn't enough. You need to know *why* the numbers moved.
* **Automated Correlation:** We ingest the Biosensor data and instantly map it against your SCADA (Flow, Temp) and Weather data.
* **Actionable Intelligence:** We tell you: *"Toxicity spiked because flow reduced,"* not just *"Toxicity spiked."*

## 4. Validated ROI: The Power of Speed
During the Imperial Kearl pilot, high-frequency biosensor data revealed efficiencies that monthly sampling missed:

| Insight | The Biosensor Advantage | Annual Value |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Recovery Speed** | Proved treatment recovered in 7 days (vs. 14-day guess). | **$14,000 + Capacity** |
| **Seasonal Strategy** | Proved biological activity continued at lower temps. | **$104,000** |
| **Spatial Optimization** | Detected 18% better performance in shallow zones. | **$78,000** |
| **Toxicity Proxy** | Validated correlation with expensive Bio-Assays. | **$36,000** |
| **TOTAL** | | **$260,000 / year** |

## 5. Project Timeline (9 Months)
* **Phase 1 (Month 1-2):** Sensor Calibration & Baseline Establishment.
* **Phase 2 (Month 3-8):** Active Monitoring (Weekly Reporting & Optimization).
* **Phase 3 (Month 9):** Readiness Baseline Delivery (2027 Compliance Data).
