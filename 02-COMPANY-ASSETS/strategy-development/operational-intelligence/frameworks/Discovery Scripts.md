# Discovery Scripts: Validating the "Upside" (Tier 2)

Goal: Validate the potential for Caustic Savings and Fresh Water Substitution without promising them as guaranteed features.

Strategy: Use "Diagnostic Questions" to make the client reveal the pain.

## 1. The Caustic Savings Hypothesis

Context: We suspect that real-time toxicity data (Panel 2) can allow operators to reduce upstream caustic dosing, saving millions.

The Trap: Do not say: "We can save you $2M on caustic." (We don't know that yet).

The Script:

**Jeff:** "We’ve been digging into the Kearl data, and we saw something interesting. When Panel 2 (Toxicity) dropped, the pH naturally stabilized without as much help. It got us thinking about upstream chemical costs."

**Jeff:** _"In your current process, is your caustic dosing set to a fixed 'Safety Factor' because you assume the worst about the water quality, or is it dynamically adjusted?"_

- (If they say "Fixed Safety Factor"):
    
    Jeff: "Interesting. If you had a dashboard that proved—daily—that the incoming water was less toxic than you thought, would operations actually trust that data enough to dial back the dosing? or is that a 'Third Rail' nobody touches?"
    
- (If they admit it's a cost pain):
    
    Jeff: "We aren't promising anything yet, but during this pilot, we could easily overlay your caustic spend against our Panel 2 data. It might show a massive efficiency gap. Is that worth tracking as a 'secondary' KPI for you?"
    

## 2. The Fresh Water Substitution Hypothesis

Context: We suspect operators use fresh water because they don't trust recycled water.

The Trap: Do not say: "We will replace your fresh water." (Regulatory risk).

The Script:

**Jeff:** "Everyone talks about fresh water reduction, but I want to understand the _actual_ bottleneck. When you decide to pull from the river instead of the recycle pond, what is the specific metric that scares you?"

**Jeff:** _"Is it the **Salt** (Chlorides), or is it the **Toxicity** risk?"_

- (If they say "Toxicity/Unknowns"):
    
    Jeff: "That’s exactly what the Biosensor solves. If we could give you a 'Green Light' on toxicity every morning, would that give you the confidence to increase the recycle ratio, or is the Chloride limit a hard stop regardless?"
    
- (If they say "Chlorides are the hard stop"):
    
    Jeff: "Okay, that helps. Our Confluent engine can ingest your Chloride data too. We can build a model that says: 'Toxicity is Low, but Chlorides are High = Don't Recycle.' versus 'Both are Low = Safe to Recycle.' Right now, you're probably treating both scenarios as 'Unsafe' just to be sure, right?"
    

## 3. The "Stakeholder Authority" Check (Gap G3)

Context: We need to know if we are selling to Ops (Efficiency) or Environment (Compliance).

The Script:

**Jeff:** _"This pilot pays for itself in 5 months on operational savings alone ($260k). But the long-term value is the 2027 Regulatory Baseline."_

**Jeff:** _"When it comes to signing the check for a pilot like this—does this budget come from the **Process/Maintenance** side (because it helps daily ops), or does it have to go through the **Environmental Projects** committee?"_

- _(Note: You want "Process/Maintenance." Environmental committees are where pilots go to die)._
    

**Jeff:** _"If we frame this as a 'Process Optimization' pilot that just happens to generate regulatory data as a bonus, does that make it easier for you to approve internally?"_
