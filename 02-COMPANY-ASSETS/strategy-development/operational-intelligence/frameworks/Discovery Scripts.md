# Discovery Scripts: Validating the "Upside" & "Complexity"

Goal: Validate the potential for Caustic Savings and the pain of Multivariate Complexity without sounding arrogant.

Strategy: Use "Diagnostic Questions" to make the client reveal the pain.

## 1. The "Complexity Gap" Check (New)
**Context:** We need to confirm that they are struggling to correlate Bio/Chem/Physics data manually.

**Jeff:** "You guys have incredible pilots running. When you try to move those learnings to daily operations, where does the friction happen?"

**Jeff:** *"When a treatment rate drops, how hard is it to correlate that with a temperature shift from yesterday or a flow change from this morning? Is that automatic for you, or is someone digging through spreadsheets?"*

**(If they say "Spreadsheets"):**
**Jeff:** "That's what we hear everywhere. That's exactly why we built the Relational Context Engine—to automate that lookup so your experts can focus on the decision, not the data digging."

## 2. The Caustic Savings Hypothesis (Softened)
**Context:** We suspect real-time data allows for chemical optimization.

**Jeff:** "We’ve noticed in the Kearl data that toxicity often drops naturally before standard chemical dosing is adjusted. It’s a hypothesis of ours that there might be room for optimization there."

**Jeff:** *"In your current process, is caustic dosing set to a fixed 'Safety Factor' because you have to assume the worst, or do you have the data confidence to adjust it dynamically?"*

**(If "Safety Factor"):**
**Jeff:** "If we could give you a daily 'Green Light' on toxicity, would your team be open to testing a dynamic dosing strategy, or is that a 'Third Rail' nobody touches right now?"

## 3. The "Trust Deficit" Check (Glass Box)
**Context:** Validating the Tier 3 Regulatory value.

**Jeff:** *"Looking ahead to the 2027 release guidelines—how much of a headache is the data audit going to be?"*

**Jeff:** *"When you submit that baseline data, do you have a system in place to prove the chain of custody from the sensor to the report, or is it going to be a manual compilation project?"*

**(If "Manual"):**
**Jeff:** "One of the things we built into our platform is an immutable audit trail. It’s basically a 'Glass Box' for the regulator—proving the data hasn't been touched. Is that something that would help you internally?"
