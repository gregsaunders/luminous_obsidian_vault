# An Analytical Synthesis of the Oil Sands Mine Water Science Team's Technical Reports and Commentary

## Executive Summary

This report provides a comprehensive analytical synthesis of the compendium document titled "Oil Sands Mine Water Science Team - final technical reports and commentary," published by the Government of Alberta. This foundational body of work was commissioned to address critical scientific information gaps surrounding the potential for treating and releasing accumulated oil sands mine water (OSMW) into the Lower Athabasca River. The work was overseen by the Oil Sands Mine Water Science Team (OSMWST), a multi-stakeholder body comprising experts from Indigenous communities, the oil sands industry, government, and academia, whose mandate was to review the technical work and provide expert commentary.

The scientific program was structured around six key work plans, each addressing a distinct information gap: (1) predictive environmental modeling, (2) human and ecological health risk assessment, (3) technology-based effluent limits, (4) whole-effluent toxicity testing, (5) baseline environmental monitoring data analysis, and (6) future environmental effects monitoring program design.

The technical reports, prepared by independent consultants, present a series of key findings based on a hypothetical regional release scenario. Predictive modeling (Work Plan 1) concluded that while such a release would cause statistically detectable changes in the river's chemistry, potentially exceeding conservative "early warning" triggers, the concentrations of contaminants would remain well below the protective environmental "limits" established to prevent adverse effects on aquatic life and other water uses. The subsequent Human and Ecological Health Risk Assessment (HEHRA, Work Plan 2) built upon this modeling, concluding that the incremental risks to aquatic life, wildlife, and human health from the hypothetical release would be low and within acceptable regulatory thresholds. However, the HEHRA also highlighted significant scientific uncertainties, particularly concerning the long-term effects of complex chemical mixtures unique to OSMW. Concurrently, assessments of treatment technologies (Work Plan 3) and toxicity testing protocols (Work Plan 4) established frameworks for what could be technologically achievable and how effluent safety could be regulated, while analyses of baseline data (Work Plan 5) underscored the challenges that the river's high natural variability poses for designing effective future monitoring programs (Work Plan 6).

Despite the extensive technical work, the Science Team's commentary reveals a profound lack of consensus among the expert caucuses. The Indigenous Caucus identified what it termed "fatal flaws" in the methodology, including the use of an unvalidated environmental model and an "inflammatory" and potentially illegal release scenario, leading to a full rejection of the reports' conclusions. Conversely, the Industry Caucus largely endorsed the work as a comprehensive and scientifically sound assessment. The Government Caucus adopted a middle position, acknowledging the reports as a useful framework while highlighting significant remaining data gaps and uncertainties.

The primary conclusion of this synthesis is that the OSMWST process did not produce a unified body of scientific fact upon which to base policy. Instead, its most significant output is the clear documentation of deep scientific uncertainty and fundamental disagreement among key expert stakeholders. The central, overarching message, agreed upon by all parties, is that this entire exercise is a preliminary, hypothetical assessment. It is consistently and emphatically stated that **no policy decision on the release of treated OSMW has been made.** Furthermore, no such release will be authorized unless it can be definitively demonstrated to be safe through future, rigorous, site-specific assessments, and a comprehensive regulatory framework is established to ensure the unequivocal protection of human and ecological health. This body of work serves not as an answer, but as a detailed map of the complex scientific and socio-political terrain that must be navigated before any such policy decisions can be contemplated.

## 1. Mandate and Framework: The Oil Sands Mine Water Science Team

### 1.1 The Challenge of Oil Sands Mine Water Accumulation

The surface mining of bitumen from Alberta's oil sands is a water-intensive industrial process that generates vast quantities of process-affected water. This water, which has been in direct contact with the oil sands ore, is stored on-site in large tailings ponds. Over decades of operation, the accumulated volume of this oil sands mine water (OSMW) has grown to represent a significant environmental liability and a central challenge for the progressive reclamation of mine sites. The Government of Alberta, committed to the principle of returning mined lands to the Crown with equivalent land capability, has been exploring a range of options to manage this legacy and ongoing accumulation of OSMW.1

One potential management option, formally identified within Alberta's _Tailings Management Framework for the Mineable Athabasca Oil Sands_ (2015), is the possibility of treating OSMW to a quality that is safe for controlled release into the adjacent Lower Athabasca River. This option presents a complex nexus of technical, ecological, social, and regulatory challenges. It necessitates a profound understanding of the chemical composition of treated OSMW, the efficacy and economic feasibility of treatment technologies, the fate and transport of any residual constituents in a large and dynamic river system, and the potential risks to the intricate aquatic ecosystem and the human communities that depend upon it.1

Recognizing the gravity of this potential policy direction and the significant scientific questions it entails, the Government of Alberta initiated a formal process to address key knowledge gaps. It is a foundational premise of this entire body of work, and a point repeatedly emphasized throughout the resulting reports, that this initiative is a scientific information-gathering exercise. It does not represent a predetermined path toward permitting the release of treated OSMW. The reports consistently state that **no policy decision has been made** on this matter, and no release will be authorized unless and until it can be definitively and scientifically demonstrated that it can be executed safely, with robust policy and regulatory frameworks in place to protect human and ecological health.1

### 1.2 Formation and Composition of the Multi-Stakeholder Science Team

To navigate the scientific complexities and ensure a diversity of expert perspectives were brought to bear on the issue, Alberta Environment and Protected Areas (EPA) established the Oil Sands Mine Water Science Team (OSMWST) in August 2020. The formation of this team was the central mechanism for addressing the identified information gaps and providing a scientifically credible foundation for any future policy considerations.1

The composition of the OSMWST was deliberately multi-stakeholder in nature, reflecting a recognition that the issue of releasing treated OSMW transcends purely technical questions and engages deeply held community values, Indigenous rights, and industrial interests. The team included credentialed scientific and technical experts drawn from a wide array of organizations, including 1:

- **Indigenous Communities:** Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation, Fort Chipewyan Métis Nation, Fort McKay First Nation, McMurray Métis Nation, Mikisew Cree First Nation, and Smith's Landing First Nation.
    
- **Industry and Industry Associations:** Canada's Oil Sands Innovation Alliance (COSIA), Canadian Natural Resources Limited, Imperial Oil, Suncor Energy, and Syncrude Canada.
    
- **Provincial Government and Regulators:** Alberta Environment and Protected Areas, the Alberta Energy Regulator, and Alberta Health.
    
- **Federal Government and Regulators:** Environment and Climate Change Canada and Health Canada.
    
- **Academia:** The team was chaired by the Campus Alberta Innovation Program Chair in Aquatic Ecosystem Health.
    

The formal mandate of the OSMWST was to provide expert oversight and review of a series of technical work plans and the subsequent detailed reports prepared by consultants hired by the Government of Alberta. Team members provided substantial feedback on draft versions of these documents, which was then considered by the consultants during finalization. A crucial part of the team's role was to prepare complementary "commentary reports" to be published alongside the technical findings. These commentaries were designed to summarize the perspectives of the various members and caucuses on the strengths and contributions of the technical reports, as well as to formally document any outstanding scientific gaps, deficiencies, or unresolved concerns.1

This structure, which formalized the roles of distinct caucuses (Indigenous, Industry, Government), was a mechanism to manage and transparently document the input of groups with diverse and, at times, fundamentally opposing interests, values, and scientific paradigms. The very design of the OSMWST process anticipated the potential for disagreement and created a formal channel for that disagreement to be recorded. This structure is a precursor to, and a primary explanation for, the divergent conclusions and profound lack of consensus that characterize the final commentary reports. The process was thus designed not necessarily to achieve consensus, but to clearly articulate the state of scientific understanding alongside the full spectrum of expert opinion and contention.

### 1.3 The Six Key Information Gaps: A Foundation for Policy Deliberation

The scientific program overseen by the OSMWST was organized around six key information gaps. These were identified by the Government of Alberta as the most critical areas where further scientific knowledge was required before any informed policy guidance on the release of treated OSMW could be developed. Each gap became the subject of a detailed technical report, or "Work Plan," forming the structural backbone of the entire endeavor. This systematic approach was intended to ensure that all major facets of the issue—from contaminant modeling to risk assessment to monitoring design—were addressed in a logical sequence.1

The six information gaps and their corresponding work plans provide a clear roadmap for understanding the scientific investigation that was undertaken 1:

1. **Modeling Environmental Concentrations and Effects:** This work plan focused on using predictive computer models to simulate how concentrations of substances from a hypothetical release of treated OSMW would behave in the Lower Athabasca River and its delta.
    
2. **Human and Ecological Health Risk Assessment:** This work plan used the outputs from the modeling study to assess the potential risks that the predicted environmental concentrations might pose to aquatic organisms, wildlife, and human populations in the region.
    
3. **Technology-Based Effluent Limits Assessment:** This work plan reviewed existing water treatment technologies and regulatory limits from other industries to help establish what level of water quality is technologically and economically achievable for treated OSMW.
    
4. **Treated Effluent Toxicity Assessments:** This work plan focused on the use of whole-effluent toxicity (WET) testing—which exposes aquatic organisms directly to effluent samples—as a tool for regulatory management and compliance.
    
5. **Enhanced Baseline Environmental Monitoring:** This work plan involved the detailed statistical analysis of existing environmental monitoring data to better understand the natural variability of the Athabasca River system, which is crucial for detecting future changes.
    
6. **Local and Regional-Scale Environmental Monitoring Design:** This work plan provided guidance and options for designing a future environmental effects monitoring (EEM) program that could be implemented to track the health of the river if a release were ever approved.
    

Together, these six work plans represent a comprehensive attempt to build a foundational scientific understanding of the potential consequences and regulatory requirements associated with releasing treated OSMW. The structure and findings of this summary report are organized around the analysis of each of these six distinct but deeply interconnected bodies of work.

## 2. Predictive Environmental Fate: Modelling Contaminant Concentrations (Work Plan 1)

The foundational component of the scientific program was Work Plan 1, which sought to predict the environmental fate of constituents released in treated OSMW. Without a quantitative estimate of how these substances would disperse and what concentrations they would reach in the river, no meaningful assessment of risk or impact would be possible. This work was conducted in two phases: Phase I focused on the mainstem of the Lower Athabasca River (LAR) from Fort McMurray to Old Fort, while Phase II extended the analysis into the complex network of channels and lakes in the Athabasca River Delta.1

### 2.1 The Hypothetical Regional Release Scenario

The core of the modeling exercise was a carefully defined, hypothetical "regional release scenario." This was not a model of any single, specific project proposal, but rather a cumulative assessment designed to represent a plausible future state between 2025 and 2035 where the release of treated OSMW is permitted. The scenario included the continuation of two existing approved releases (Suncor Industrial Wastewater and Aurora North depressurization water) combined with six new hypothetical releases. These new sources comprised water from two end-pit lakes (Base Mine Lake and Lake Miwasin), treated depressurization water from two additional sites, and treated oil sands process water (OSPW) from two sites.1

The chemical composition, or "water quality profile," for each of these hypothetical releases was developed in consultation with industry operators. A critical assumption underpinning the entire analysis was that these effluents would be treated to a level consistent with established Technology-Based Effluent Limits (TBELs) from comparable industrial sectors, such as metal mining and municipal wastewater treatment. This assumption links the modeling exercise to a standard of achievable treatment performance, rather than modeling the release of raw, untreated water.1 The modelers also considered three different release management strategies to understand the influence of timing on river concentrations: a continuous year-round release, a release restricted to the open-water season (April to October), and a release further restricted to only the peak-flow period (May to August).1

### 2.2 Near-Field Impacts: Mixing Zones and Acute Guideline Compliance

The first stage of the impact analysis focused on the "near-field"—the area immediately downstream of a discharge outfall where the effluent initially mixes with the river water. Using established regulatory models, including the Cornell Mixing Zone Expert System (CORMIX) and the Athabasca River Model (ARM), the study predicted the size of the mixing zone required for effluent to dilute to safe levels. The modeling was conducted under conservative, "worst-case" conditions, assuming the simultaneous release from all sources at their peak concentrations into the river during a period of extreme low flow (the 1-in-10-year low flow, or 1Q10).1

The results of this near-field analysis indicated rapid and effective dilution. The key findings were 1:

- **Acute Guideline Compliance:** Predicted concentrations were found to meet the applicable _acute_ water quality guidelines for the protection of aquatic life within a very short distance of 5 to 30 meters downstream from the outfall. Acute guidelines are designed to protect organisms from severe, short-term effects.
    
- **Chronic Guideline Compliance:** The more stringent _chronic_ guidelines, which are designed to protect organisms from long-term, continuous exposure, were predicted to be met in most cases within 5 to 400 meters downstream of the outfall.
    

The report also noted that the spatial extent of these mixing zones could be effectively minimized through engineering and design choices. The use of multiport diffusers, which release effluent through multiple small ports rather than a single large pipe, was identified as a key mitigation measure to enhance initial mixing. Furthermore, the strategic siting of outfalls in areas of the river with relatively high depth and velocity was shown to significantly improve dilution and reduce the potential for contaminants to settle into the riverbed sediments.1

### 2.3 Regional Impacts: SWQMFLAR Triggers vs. Limits for Key Contaminants

Beyond the immediate mixing zone, the study assessed the potential for cumulative, regional-scale changes in water quality. The primary tool for this evaluation was the comparison of predicted concentrations at the long-term monitoring station at Old Fort against the regulatory thresholds established in Alberta's _Surface Water Quality Management Framework for the Lower Athabasca River_ (SWQMFLAR). This framework is a critical component of the regional land-use plan and employs a two-tiered system of thresholds: conservative "triggers" and protective "limits".1

The distinction between these two thresholds is the central technical finding of the entire modeling exercise and the pivot point for much of the subsequent policy debate.

- **SWQMFLAR Limits:** These are health-based, protective values derived from established water quality guidelines. A limit represents a concentration that should not be exceeded to ensure the protection of aquatic ecosystems and other water uses like drinking water or agriculture. The modeling concluded that for the hypothetical regional release scenario, predicted concentrations of all substances at Old Fort were **well below** their respective SWQMFLAR limits. This is a crucial finding, as it suggests that, based on the model, the cumulative release would not push the river into a state considered harmful to the ecosystem.1
    
- **SWQMFLAR Triggers:** These are not health-based thresholds but are statistically derived "early warning" signals. They are set conservatively based on the historical range of water quality at Old Fort. An exceedance of a trigger does not necessarily indicate an ecological problem but signals a statistically significant change from past conditions that warrants further investigation. The modeling predicted that for some substances, these triggers **would likely be exceeded** over a period of several years.1
    

The report provided specific examples of this trigger-limit dynamic. For chloride, a component of saline depressurization water, concentrations were predicted to exceed the mean SWQMFLAR trigger of 20.2 mg/L by approximately 7 mg/L. For molybdenum, a trace element associated with OSPW, the mean concentration at Old Fort was predicted to more than double from its historical average of 0.73 μg/L to 2.2 μg/L. While this represents a significant statistical change from the baseline (exceeding the trigger), this new concentration of 2.2 μg/L still represents only 15% of the protective SWQMFLAR limit for molybdenum.1

This nuanced outcome creates a complex regulatory and policy challenge. The model predicts a future in which the river's chemistry is demonstrably and statistically different from its past, yet remains within a state that is scientifically defined as safe and protective of aquatic health. This forces a fundamental policy judgment that goes beyond simple scientific metrics: Is any detectable, human-caused change to the river's chemistry acceptable, even if that change is modeled to be safe? This question sits at the heart of the divergent perspectives expressed by the Science Team members and frames the core debate for policymakers.

### 2.4 Preliminary Sediment Quality Predictions and Limitations

The modeling work also included an initial assessment of potential changes to the quality of bed sediments in the river. The report is careful to frame these findings as both preliminary and precautionary, acknowledging the complexities of sediment transport and contaminant binding.1

The focus of the sediment analysis was on depositional areas—localized zones where slower-moving water allows fine-grained particles to settle out of the water column. The modeling predicted that any measurable changes in sediment contaminant concentrations would be confined to these very small, specific areas, which collectively represent less than 1% of the total riverbed area. For the vast majority of the river, which is characterized by faster flows and coarser bed material, no changes in sediment quality were anticipated. Further refinement and validation of the sediment modeling were identified as necessary future work, particularly for the Phase II analysis of the deposition-dominated Athabasca River Delta.1

## 3. Assessing Potential Impacts: Human and Ecological Health Risk Assessment (Work Plan 2)

Following the predictive modeling of environmental concentrations, Work Plan 2 undertook a formal Human and Ecological Health Risk Assessment (HEHRA) to interpret what those predicted concentrations might mean for the health of the river's ecosystem and the people who rely on it. The HEHRA is a structured, multi-step process that provides a quantitative estimate of potential risk, forming a critical bridge between the raw environmental data and its implications for protection goals.1

### 3.1 The HEHRA Framework: Receptors, Pathways, and Endpoints

The HEHRA was conducted in accordance with standard protocols established by regulatory agencies like Health Canada and Environment and Climate Change Canada. The assessment was entirely dependent on the outputs of the Work Plan 1 modeling, using the predicted concentrations of substances in water, sediment, and suspended solids as the foundational exposure data for the various release scenarios (Year-Round, Open-Water, and Peak-Flow) as well as for the baseline condition.1

The framework for the assessment involved three distinct but interconnected components:

- **Aquatic Ecological Risk Assessment (AERA):** This evaluated potential risks to organisms living in the river, such as algae, benthic invertebrates (insects and mussels living in the sediment), and fish.
    
- **Wildlife Health Risk Assessment (WHRA):** This evaluated potential risks to semi-aquatic wildlife that are closely linked to the river for food or habitat, such as mink, river otter, and various waterfowl.
    
- **Human Health Risk Assessment (HHRA):** This evaluated potential risks to human populations in the Lower Athabasca Region, with a specific focus on the exposure patterns of Indigenous community members who may have higher rates of consumption of traditional foods, such as fish and wild game harvested from the region.1
    

For each component, the assessment identified the relevant chemicals of potential concern (COPCs), the receptors of concern (the species or human populations potentially affected), and the operable exposure pathways (the routes by which a receptor might come into contact with a COPC, such as breathing air, drinking water, direct skin contact, or consuming contaminated food).1

### 3.2 Aquatic Health Risk Characterization

The AERA component of the report evaluated the potential for adverse effects on the aquatic community through direct contact with contaminants in surface water and sediment, as well as through the process of bioaccumulation, where substances build up in the tissues of organisms over time. The assessment compared the predicted environmental concentrations (PECs) from the model to established toxicological reference values (TRVs), or benchmarks, below which adverse effects are not expected to occur.1

The overall conclusion of the AERA was that for the majority of individual substances, particularly metals and major ions, the risks to aquatic life under the hypothetical release scenario were **negligible to low**. For several metals, such as aluminum and lead, the assessment found that while predicted concentrations sometimes exceeded chronic guidelines, these exceedances were driven by existing baseline conditions in the river (largely related to natural geology and suspended sediment levels) and were not meaningfully increased by the addition of treated OSMW. However, the assessment identified a higher degree of uncertainty and a slightly elevated risk profile for complex organic mixtures 1:

- **Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs):** The risk from PAHs was characterized as **negligible-to-low** for most organisms, but was elevated to **low** for piscivorous (fish-eating) fish. This was due to the high uncertainty associated with predicting the toxicity of the complex mixture of both parent and alkylated PAHs found in oil sands-related materials.
    
- **Naphthenic Acids:** The risk from total naphthenic acids was determined to be **negligible** for most aquatic life. However, similar to PAHs, the risk was elevated to **low-to-moderate** for piscivorous fish. This conclusion was heavily influenced by the lack of a definitive, regulatory-endorsed water quality guideline for naphthenic acids and the scientific uncertainty surrounding the toxicity of different acid structures within the complex mixture.
    

### 3.3 Human Health Risk Characterization for Regional Populations

The HHRA component focused on the potential for incremental changes in health risks for people living in the region. The assessment modeled exposure through multiple pathways, including the consumption of drinking water, incidental ingestion of river water during recreation, and, most importantly, the consumption of traditional foods like fish, moose, and waterfowl, whose tissues may accumulate certain contaminants from the environment.1

The primary conclusion of the HHRA was that the potential incremental health risks—both non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic—associated with the hypothetical release of treated OSMW were **low and fell within the range of what is considered acceptable** by regulatory agencies like Health Canada. The assessment did note, however, that for some substance groups, particularly petroleum hydrocarbon (PHC) fractions F2 and F3, the estimated baseline risks (i.e., the risks present in the region _before_ the addition of treated OSMW) were already elevated, primarily due to the consumption of traditional foods. The hypothetical OSMW release was predicted to add a small, incremental amount of risk on top of this existing baseline, but this increment did not push the total risk beyond acceptable regulatory thresholds.1 The assessment of fish tainting potential was identified as a key uncertainty, as this could impact the consumption of traditional foods even in the absence of a direct health risk.

### 3.4 Key Uncertainties

A hallmark of a rigorous risk assessment is the transparent identification of uncertainties, and the HEHRA report dedicates significant attention to this aspect. The conclusions of low risk are heavily qualified by the acknowledgment of several major sources of uncertainty that limit the confidence in the quantitative risk estimates.1 The most critical of these include:

- **Mixture Toxicity:** This was identified as a primary uncertainty for both the AERA and the HHRA. Most regulatory guidelines are based on the toxicity of individual chemicals. However, OSMW is a complex mixture of hundreds or thousands of different organic and inorganic compounds. The combined toxic effect of this mixture may be additive, synergistic (greater than the sum of its parts), or antagonistic (less than the sum). The science for predicting the toxicity of such complex mixtures is still evolving, and this uncertainty is particularly high for oil sands-specific organic groups like naphthenic acids and alkylated PAHs.1
    
- **Toxicological Data Gaps:** For some of the unique compounds found in OSMW, there are no established toxicity reference values (TRVs) available for either aquatic life or human health. In these cases, the assessment had to rely on surrogates or less certain data, which introduces another layer of uncertainty into the risk calculations.1
    
- **Dependence on Modeled Data:** The entire HEHRA is predicated on the environmental concentrations generated by the Work Plan 1 models. Any inaccuracies or limitations in that modeling—such as the use of detection limits for non-detected chemicals, which may overestimate concentrations—are carried directly through into the risk assessment. The HEHRA conclusions are therefore entirely contingent on the validity and accuracy of the upstream environmental fate modeling.1
    

The HEHRA's conclusion of low incremental risk, when viewed alongside its explicit acknowledgment of these significant uncertainties, creates a complex narrative for policymakers. It suggests that while a standard application of risk assessment methodology does not identify an unacceptable level of risk, the novel nature of the OSMW mixture and the limitations of the predictive tools mean that a considerable degree of the unknown remains. This reinforces a framing of the policy decision not as a simple "safe vs. unsafe" binary, but as a judgment about whether accepting a small, modeled, incremental risk—with its attendant and significant scientific uncertainties—is a worthwhile trade-off for addressing the larger, existing environmental challenge of long-term OSMW storage and reclamation.

## 4. Engineering and Regulation: Establishing Effluent Limits and Testing Protocols (Work Plans 3 & 4)

While the first two work plans focused on predicting and assessing the potential environmental consequences of a hypothetical release, Work Plans 3 and 4 addressed the practical questions of regulation and control: What level of treatment is achievable, and how can the safety of a treated effluent be consistently verified? These reports provide the engineering and regulatory context for the modeling scenarios, outlining the potential technological and legal boundaries for any future discharge.

### 4.1 Technology-Based Effluent Limits (TBELs): A Review of Treatment Capabilities (Work Plan 3)

The objective of Work Plan 3 was to inform the development of Technology-Based Effluent Limits (TBELs). A TBEL is a regulatory limit placed on the concentration of a pollutant in a discharge that is based not on the receiving environment's capacity to assimilate it, but on the demonstrated performance of the best available and economically achievable pollution control technologies for a given industrial sector. In essence, a TBEL defines the level of water quality that a facility _should_ be able to achieve with modern treatment systems.1

The methodology for this work plan involved a comprehensive jurisdictional review. The consultants examined existing TBELs and related regulations for a wide range of industrial sectors considered analogous to oil sands mining, including metal and diamond mining, petroleum refining, coal mining, and municipal wastewater treatment. This review spanned regulations in Alberta, other Canadian provinces, federal regulations under the _Fisheries Act_, and regulations in the United States and the European Union.1

The key finding of this report is the establishment of a preliminary, potential range for numeric, concentration-based TBELs for a suite of 34 parameters in treated OSMW. However, the report is unequivocal in stating that this is a **first step** in a longer, iterative process. A critical limitation identified is the lack of performance data from full, commercial-scale treatment systems specifically designed for OSMW. Consequently, the report concludes that a crucial next step, prior to the establishment of any final, legally binding TBELs, must be a dedicated performance evaluation stage. This would involve a rigorous program of bench-scale, pilot-scale, and eventually demonstration-scale testing of promising treatment technologies to generate the robust, real-world data needed to define what is truly the "best available demonstrated technology" for this unique wastewater.1

The report also highlighted specific technological and economic challenges. The management of high concentrations of dissolved salts (total dissolved solids, or TDS), particularly chloride from depressurization water, was identified as a major hurdle. While technologies such as reverse osmosis can effectively remove these salts, they are often considered to be uneconomical at the scale required for oil sands operations and create a concentrated brine waste stream that presents its own disposal challenges.1 This finding is particularly salient, as it reveals a potential conflict between what may be required to meet water quality objectives and what is considered economically achievable by industry.

### 4.2 Whole-Effluent Toxicity (WET) Testing: A Proposed Regulatory Framework (Work Plan 4)

Work Plan 4 addressed a complementary aspect of effluent regulation: the use of Whole-Effluent Toxicity (WET) testing. While chemical-specific limits like TBELs regulate individual known substances, WET tests provide a holistic measure of an effluent's overall safety. These are standardized laboratory bioassays that expose sensitive aquatic organisms, such as rainbow trout or the water flea _Daphnia magna_, directly to samples of the effluent to measure its aggregate toxic effect. A common regulatory requirement is that there be no acute lethality, meaning that more than 50% of the test organisms must survive a 96-hour exposure to the undiluted effluent.1

Similar to the TBELs report, this work plan was based on a jurisdictional scan of how WET testing is incorporated into the regulatory frameworks for other industrial sectors across Canada and internationally. The report reviewed the various standardized test methods, species, and endpoints (e.g., survival, growth, reproduction) that are used to manage industrial discharges.1

The primary output of Work Plan 4 is not a prescriptive list of required tests, but rather a recommended **framework and logic for the selection of an appropriate suite of toxicity tests**. The report proposes a tiered approach tailored to the different phases of a potential release 1:

1. **Planning and Application Phase:** During the initial assessment of a proposed treatment technology and before any release is approved, the report recommends casting a "wide net" by using a broad and comprehensive battery of toxicity tests. This would include tests on a variety of organisms (fish, invertebrates, algae) and endpoints (acute and chronic) to fully characterize the potential toxicological profile of the treated effluent.
    
2. **Regulatory Monitoring Phase:** Once a release is approved, a smaller, standardized subset of these tests would be selected for routine, ongoing compliance monitoring to ensure the treatment process remains effective and the effluent remains non-toxic.
    
3. **Environmental Effects Monitoring Phase:** Additional, potentially more sensitive or ecologically relevant tests could be incorporated into the long-term environmental monitoring program to investigate subtle, sub-lethal effects in the receiving environment.
    

This framework provides a logical pathway for using WET testing as a robust regulatory tool, moving from broad characterization to targeted compliance monitoring. The report acknowledges that the specific tests chosen would ultimately depend on the final chemical characteristics of the treated effluent from a given facility.1

A critical point of friction, however, arises when comparing the findings of these regulatory work plans with the scenario modeled in Work Plan 1. The commentary from the Indigenous Caucus highlights a fundamental tension: the hypothetical release scenario modeled in Work Plan 1 contained high concentrations of total dissolved solids and chloride. The TBELs report (Work Plan 3) acknowledges that treating these salts to low levels is technologically and economically challenging. Most importantly, these high salt concentrations would likely cause the effluent to fail the standard WET tests (particularly the sensitive _Daphnia magna_ test) that are legally required for other mining sectors under the federal _Fisheries Act_ and which Work Plan 4 identifies as a key regulatory tool. This reveals a significant logical disconnect within the overall scientific program: the central scenario that was modeled to assess environmental risk may not represent an effluent that could be legally discharged under the very regulatory frameworks being contemplated. This suggests that future assessments must more tightly integrate the modeling of environmental fate with the practical realities of what is both technologically achievable and legally permissible.

## 5. Monitoring for Change: Baseline Variability and Future Program Design (Work Plans 5 & 6)

The final two work plans addressed the critical issue of monitoring. If a release of treated OSMW were ever to be permitted, a robust monitoring program would be essential to verify that the predictive models were accurate and to detect any unforeseen environmental effects. These work plans focused on understanding the existing state of the river and providing guidance on how to design such a future monitoring program.

### 5.1 Characterizing the Baseline: Statistical Analysis of Environmental Variability (Work Plan 5)

The objective of Work Plan 5 was to provide a deeper understanding of the existing environmental conditions in the Lower Athabasca River. To detect a change caused by a new industrial input, one must first have a thorough understanding of the system's natural or existing range of variability. The report was based on a detailed statistical analysis of environmental data collected by the Oil Sands Monitoring (OSM) program, with a particular focus on an "enhanced monitoring program" conducted in 2018 and 2019. This enhanced program involved more intensive sampling of water chemistry, sediment chemistry, benthic invertebrate communities, and fish health in the area of a potential future pilot release.1

The core task of the report was to characterize the spatial and temporal variability in these datasets and, critically, to use that characterization to conduct a statistical power analysis. A power analysis calculates the probability of detecting a real environmental change of a certain magnitude, given the natural "noise" or variability in the data. It is a fundamental tool for assessing the adequacy of a monitoring program design.1

The key finding of this work was a quantitative characterization of the river's variability and the resulting implications for monitoring. The analysis demonstrated that for many parameters, particularly those that are highly variable and influenced by factors like river flow (e.g., suspended solids and associated metals), a considerable degree of change would need to occur before it could be detected with high statistical confidence. For some parameters of key concern, such as naphthenic acids, the analysis found that the variability in the baseline data was so high that **only very large changes could be reliably detected** with the current sampling design and frequency.1

The commentary reports from several Science Team members, including the Indigenous and Government caucuses, highlighted significant limitations of this work. A primary concern was that the analysis was based on only two years of open-water data (2018-2019) and did not include data from the critical winter low-flow period, when the river has the least capacity to dilute effluents. This temporal limitation restricts the generalizability of the findings and underscores the need for a more comprehensive, multi-year baseline dataset before any release could be considered.1

### 5.2 Designing a Future Environmental Effects Monitoring (EEM) Program (Work Plan 6)

Building on the understanding of baseline variability, the objective of Work Plan 6 was to provide high-level guidance and design options for a future, local-scale Environmental Effects Monitoring (EEM) program. Such a program would be a mandatory regulatory requirement for any facility approved to discharge treated OSMW and would be designed to answer the fundamental question: "Is the discharge having a negative effect on the aquatic ecosystem?".1

The report reviewed the established EEM frameworks used for other industrial sectors in Canada, such as pulp and paper mills and metal mines, which have been regulated under the federal _Fisheries Act_ for decades. These programs typically involve cyclical monitoring of fish and benthic invertebrate populations in areas exposed to the effluent and in comparable reference areas to detect effects on endpoints like fish growth, reproduction, and survival, or changes in the benthic community structure.1

The report identified the key considerations and challenges for applying an EEM-type design to the Lower Athabasca River. These challenges include the sheer size and physical power of the river, which makes sampling difficult; the naturally dynamic and shifting nature of the riverbed substrate; and the potential for multiple discharges to be located in relatively close proximity, which could confound the ability to attribute an observed effect to a single source. The report's primary recommendation for a study design is the **Before-After-Control-Impact (BACI)** design, which involves collecting data at both control (reference) and impact (exposure) locations, both before and after the discharge begins. This is considered the most statistically robust design for detecting environmental impacts.1

However, the report stops short of providing a detailed, prescriptive monitoring program. Instead, it offers a high-level framework and emphasizes the critical importance of a collaborative design process. A key theme is the need for meaningful community engagement, particularly with Indigenous communities, to ensure that the monitoring program includes indicators and endpoints that are relevant to their concerns, values, and traditional uses of the river and its resources.1

The findings of these two monitoring-focused work plans are deeply interconnected. The high natural variability and resulting low statistical power for some parameters, as identified in Work Plan 5, act as a direct and significant constraint on the design ambitions of Work Plan 6. If the baseline data demonstrates that detecting subtle, near-field effects for key contaminants is statistically challenging or requires an unfeasibly large sampling effort, then any EEM program designed for the river will be inherently limited in its sensitivity. This diminishes the program's "early warning" capability. This reality has profound regulatory implications: if the monitoring system can only be relied upon to detect large, significant effects, it places a much heavier burden of proof on the pre-release predictive models (Work Plan 1) and risk assessments (Work Plan 2) to be exceptionally robust and conservative in their demonstration of safety before any discharge is ever contemplated.

## 6. Synthesis of Perspectives: Commentary and Points of Contention

The publication of commentary reports from the various caucuses of the Oil Sands Mine Water Science Team is a unique and critically important feature of this overall body of work. These commentaries move beyond the dispassionate technical findings of the consultants' reports to reveal the expert interpretations, residual concerns, and fundamental disagreements among the key stakeholder groups. A synthesis of these commentaries demonstrates that the scientific process, as conducted, did not lead to a unified consensus. Instead, it resulted in a clear documentation of a profound schism in expert opinion on the validity, completeness, and interpretation of the science.1

### 6.1 Indigenous Caucus Perspectives

The collective commentary from the Indigenous Caucus—representing six First Nations and Métis communities from the region—is unequivocal in its assessment. The caucus states that the technical work is beset by "fatal flaws" and, as a result, the reports are not endorsed. Their position is not one of minor disagreement with specific findings, but a fundamental rejection of the methodological and procedural basis of the entire scientific program.1

The key concerns articulated by the Indigenous Caucus include:

- **Model Validation and Precaution:** A central critique is that the primary modeling tool, the Athabasca River Model (ARM), is not considered to be fully validated for its predictions of suspended solids and bed sediment transport. This is seen as a critical flaw that leads to a consistent underestimation of risks, particularly in the downstream reaches and the Athabasca River Delta, which are of paramount importance to the communities. This approach is viewed as the opposite of the precautionary principle that should guide such work.1
    
- **Scenario Selection:** The caucus was highly critical of the decision to base the entire modeling and risk assessment effort on a single, industry-proposed hypothetical release scenario. This scenario was described as "inflammatory" because it included very high concentrations of total dissolved solids and chloride—levels that the caucus argues would not be legal under the federal _Fisheries Act_ as they would fail standard acute toxicity tests. The failure to model more realistic or best-case treatment scenarios is seen as a critical deficiency that skewed the entire analysis.1
    
- **Lack of Integration and Sequencing:** A major procedural flaw identified was the poor sequencing of the work plans. The caucus argues that the modeling of environmental concentrations (Work Plan 1) and the subsequent risk assessment (Work Plan 2) should have been informed by the findings of the reports on what is technologically achievable (TBELs, Work Plan 3) and what is required for toxicity compliance (WET testing, Work Plan 4). The failure to do so created the logical disconnect where the risks of an unachievable and potentially illegal effluent were being assessed.1
    
- **Process, Consultation, and Knowledge Integration:** The caucus repeatedly states that the process was rushed, which "precluded producing quality work that adequately addresses Indigenous community concerns." They argue that opportunities for meaningful consultation were insufficient, and as a result, the work failed to incorporate Indigenous knowledge, community-defined health indicators, or endpoints relevant to the quality of traditional foods (e.g., fish tainting), which are critical to assessing impacts on their rights and way of life.1
    

### 6.2 Industry Caucus Perspectives

In stark contrast to the Indigenous Caucus, the commentary from the Industry Caucus, representing the oil sands operators and their innovation alliance, is broadly supportive of the technical work. The reports are generally endorsed and described as "well written, comprehensive" assessments that utilize appropriate and standard scientific tools and methodologies.1

The key points raised by the Industry Caucus include:

- **Utility of Modeling:** The predictive modeling is viewed as a valuable and necessary tool for enabling informed, watershed-scale management discussions among all stakeholders. The caucus emphasizes that such models, when paired with comprehensive monitoring, provide testable predictions for managing potential cumulative effects.1
    
- **Critique of TBELs Report:** While generally supportive, the Industry Caucus did raise a significant concern with the Work Plan 3 report on Technology-Based Effluent Limits. They argue that the recommendation of potential TBELs for 34 different parameters is excessive and not aligned with the regulatory approach in other sectors, which typically focus on fewer than ten key parameters. They also stress that true TBELs should be based on the observed performance of commercial-scale treatment facilities, data which does not yet exist for OSMW.1
    
- **Scope of Toxicity Testing:** The caucus asserts that the scope of end-of-pipe WET testing should be focused on assessing the effectiveness of treatment for protecting the aquatic environment. They argue that it is not the appropriate tool for assessing human health endpoints, as that is the specific and more comprehensive purpose of the Human and Ecological Health Risk Assessment (HEHRA).1
    

### 6.3 Government Caucus Perspectives (Environment and Climate Change Canada)

The commentary provided by the federal government experts from Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) occupies a middle ground. The reports are seen as providing a "good overview and rationale" and a logical framework for future work, but this assessment is heavily qualified by an acknowledgment of significant remaining "unknowns" and data gaps.1

The key points from the Government Caucus include:

- **Acceptance of a Framework Approach:** The caucus finds the general approach of the reports to be acceptable, particularly given the major uncertainty that the final chemical composition of any future treated effluent is not yet known. The reports are seen as providing a useful framework for how to approach the problem once more specific data becomes available.1
    
- **Data Limitations:** A primary weakness identified across multiple reports is the reliance on a limited dataset. The analysis of baseline variability (Work Plan 5), for example, was based on only two years of data. The caucus stresses that more years of data are essential to strengthen the findings and increase confidence in the ability to detect change.1
    
- **Acknowledgment of Variability Challenges:** The federal experts concur with the technical finding that the high natural variability of some key parameters, such as naphthenic acids, presents a significant challenge for monitoring. They acknowledge that because of this variability, only large changes in concentration are likely to be statistically detectable with current methods.1
    

### 6.4 Analysis of Key Disagreements and Their Implications for Policy

The stark divergence in the caucus commentaries is perhaps the single most important outcome of the entire OSMWST process. The conflict is not merely a matter of differing interpretations of a shared set of facts. Rather, it represents a fundamental disagreement about what constitutes a valid, trustworthy, and sufficiently precautionary scientific process for making high-stakes environmental decisions.

The consultants, largely supported by the Industry Caucus, operated within the paradigm of standard scientific and engineering practice for conducting a hypothetical assessment. This paradigm accepts the use of established (though not locally validated) models, the definition of a plausible (though not necessarily ideal) "what if" scenario, and the application of standard risk assessment methodologies to generate quantitative estimates of risk, complete with identified uncertainties.

The Indigenous Caucus, however, challenges the very premises of this paradigm as applied to their rights and their ancestral territory. Their critique is epistemological: they question the validity of the model without comprehensive, site-specific validation; they reject the legitimacy of a risk assessment based on a scenario they deem unrealistic and unacceptable; and they view a process that does not meaningfully integrate their knowledge and specific concerns from the outset as procedurally flawed.

This schism means that the primary output of the OSMWST is not scientific consensus. It is the clear and formal documentation of scientific uncertainty and profound stakeholder disagreement. For any government body tasked with developing policy, this is a critical takeaway. A policy that relies solely on the technical conclusions of the consultants' reports, without directly and substantively addressing the fundamental critiques raised by the Indigenous Caucus, would be built on a contested scientific foundation and would almost certainly be viewed as illegitimate by the affected Indigenous Nations, leading to further conflict. The path forward for policy development is therefore not a simple matter of implementing scientific recommendations, but of navigating a landscape of deep and well-documented expert division.

**Table 3: Synthesis of Science Team Commentary on Key Work Plan Themes**

|Key Theme|Indigenous Caucus Perspective|Industry Caucus Perspective|Government Caucus (ECCC) Perspective|
|---|---|---|---|
|**WP1 Model Validity & Scenario**|**"Fatally flawed."** Model not fully validated for sediments, underestimating downstream risk. The single, "inflammatory" release scenario is unrealistic and not precautionary. 1|**Endorsed.** Modeling is a "well written, comprehensive assessment" and a useful tool for watershed-scale management discussions. 1|**Acceptable as a framework.** The general approach is logical, but acknowledges "unknowns" given that the final effluent composition is not yet defined. 1|
|**WP2 HEHRA Conclusion**|**Not endorsed.** The HEHRA is compromised by the flawed inputs from the modeling and a failure to incorporate Indigenous-defined health endpoints and concerns. 1|**Endorsed.** A comprehensive assessment using standard practices. Human health endpoints are appropriately addressed in the HEHRA, not in end-of-pipe testing. 1|No specific caucus statement on the HEHRA conclusion, but general comments on other reports highlight the need for more data to increase confidence.|
|**WP3 TBEL Approach**|**Partially supported.** Commends the analysis of treatment options but rejects the proposed broad ranges for limits, arguing the upper ranges are unacceptably toxic and inconsistent with other Canadian mining regulations. 1|**Flawed.** The recommendation of 34 TBELs is "not aligned with other sectors" and excessive. TBELs should be based on commercial-scale data, which is not yet available. 1|No specific caucus statement on the TBEL approach.|
|**WP5 Baseline Data Analysis**|**Not endorsed.** Report contains "statistical and experimental design errors." The lack of winter data and the exclusion of the third year of data render it inadequate to fill the knowledge gap. 1|**Endorsed.** The report "clearly fulfills the intended purpose" and will be useful for developing future local monitoring programs. 1|**A good start, but limited.**The main weakness is the reliance on only two years of data (2018-19). More years of data are needed to strengthen findings and confidence. 1|
|**Overall Process & Consultation**|**Inadequate.** The process was "too rushed to support any meaningful consultation." Failed to adequately address Indigenous concerns or incorporate Indigenous knowledge. 1|No major process concerns raised in the commentary. The process is implicitly endorsed through the endorsement of the final reports. 1|No major process concerns raised in the commentary. The focus is on the technical adequacy and data limitations of the reports. 1|

## 7. Overarching Conclusions and Path Forward

The comprehensive body of work produced under the direction of the Oil Sands Mine Water Science Team represents a significant, albeit preliminary, step in addressing the complex issue of managing accumulated OSMW. The six technical reports provide a detailed, multi-faceted scientific assessment of a hypothetical release scenario. However, the accompanying commentaries from the expert stakeholders reveal that the science is far from settled and that fundamental disagreements persist. The overarching conclusions must therefore be understood on two levels: the technical findings of the reports, and the procedural and social outcomes of the scientific process itself.

### 7.1 Summary of Key Scientific Findings Across All Work Plans

When synthesized, the six technical reports present a coherent, if heavily qualified, picture of a potential future. The key scientific findings can be summarized as follows:

- **Modeled Environmental Fate:** A cumulative release of treated OSMW, assuming treatment to standards comparable to other industries, is predicted to result in environmental concentrations in the Lower Athabasca River that remain well below established protective limits for aquatic health. However, the release is predicted to cause statistically significant changes from historical baseline conditions for certain parameters like chloride and molybdenum.
    
- **Predicted Health Risks:** A standard Human and Ecological Health Risk Assessment based on these modeled concentrations concluded that the incremental risks to aquatic life, wildlife, and human health are low and within acceptable regulatory bounds. This conclusion is tempered by high uncertainty, especially regarding the chronic toxicity of complex organic mixtures like naphthenic acids and PAHs.
    
- **Regulatory and Monitoring Frameworks:** Established regulatory tools, including Technology-Based Effluent Limits (TBELs) and Whole-Effluent Toxicity (WET) testing, can provide a framework for controlling and monitoring discharges. However, specific, defensible TBELs for OSMW require further pilot- and demonstration-scale data on treatment performance. Furthermore, the high natural variability of the Athabasca River presents a significant statistical challenge for designing a future monitoring program capable of detecting subtle environmental effects with high confidence.
    

### 7.2 The Precautionary Stance: The Imperative for Site-Specific Assessment

Perhaps the single most important and consistent message to emerge from the entire compendium—from the government's introduction to the consultants' conclusions to the commentaries of all caucuses—is that this entire body of work is a preliminary, hypothetical, and regional-scale exercise. It was designed to fill broad information gaps to _inform_ the early stages of policy consideration, not to serve as an approval document for any specific project.1

There is universal agreement that any actual regulatory application from an operator to release treated OSMW would trigger the need for a new, comprehensive, and site-specific suite of assessments. The findings of these work plans cannot be used as a substitute for that rigorous, project-level due diligence. As outlined in the reports, such an application would require, at a minimum 1:

- **Detailed, Site-Specific Modeling:** Tailored to the specific outfall location, diffuser design, and final effluent composition.
    
- **Detailed Treatment and Water Management Analysis:** Based on pilot- or demonstration-scale data for the specific treatment train being proposed.
    
- **Refined Effluent Characterization:** Using advanced, low-level analytical methods to accurately quantify trace contaminants.
    
- **A Comprehensive, Project-Specific Environmental Effects Evaluation:** Including a new HEHRA based on the specific release scenario.
    
- **A Detailed, Proponent-Funded Monitoring Program:** Designed to verify model predictions and detect environmental effects.
    

### 7.3 Remaining Scientific and Policy Gaps for Future Consideration

The OSMWST process was initiated to fill information gaps, and while it has provided a wealth of new analysis, it has also served to illuminate and refine the critical gaps that remain. These can be broadly categorized as scientific gaps and process or policy gaps.

**Key Remaining Scientific Gaps:**

- **Treatment Performance Data:** There is a critical need for robust performance data from commercial-scale treatment systems specifically designed for the different types of OSMW. This is a prerequisite for establishing defensible, achievable TBELs.
    
- **Chronic Mixture Toxicity:** A better understanding of the long-term, sub-lethal toxic effects of the unique, complex mixtures of organic compounds (particularly naphthenic acids and alkylated PAHs) in treated OSMW on relevant aquatic species is required to reduce the largest source of uncertainty in the risk assessment.
    
- **Comprehensive Baseline Data:** A multi-year baseline dataset that includes the full range of hydrological conditions, especially the winter low-flow period, is needed to improve the statistical power of any future monitoring program and to more accurately model worst-case conditions.
    

**Key Remaining Process and Policy Gaps:**

- **Integration of Indigenous Knowledge:** A formal, transparent, and adequately resourced framework for meaningfully integrating Indigenous knowledge, values, and community-defined indicators of health and well-being into the regulatory assessment and monitoring process needs to be developed. The current process was identified by the Indigenous Caucus as insufficient in this regard.
    
- **Reconciling Modeling with Reality:** There is a need to resolve the logical inconsistency highlighted in the commentaries, where the scenarios being modeled for risk assessment are not clearly linked to what is technologically, economically, and legally achievable under a TBEL and WET testing framework. Future modeling and risk assessment should be iteratively linked to the development of treatment standards.
    

In conclusion, the reports of the Oil Sands Mine Water Science Team provide a valuable, if contested, scientific foundation. They have advanced the technical understanding of a potential OSMW release but have also revealed the depth of the scientific uncertainties and the profound divisions in expert and stakeholder perspectives. The path forward for the Government of Alberta is not one of simple policy implementation based on these findings, but one that must first address the critical remaining scientific gaps and, perhaps more importantly, bridge the procedural and epistemological divides that this process has so clearly brought to light.
