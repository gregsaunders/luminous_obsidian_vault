This collection of reports from the Oil Sands Mine Water Science Team provides a scientific foundation for the potential future development of regulations around the release of treated oil sands mine water (OSMW) into the environment. The team was formed to address six key information gaps to ensure that any potential releases would be protective of aquatic ecosystems and human health.

Here's a summary of the key findings:

- **Environmental Impact Modeling:** Sophisticated modeling was used to predict the environmental concentrations of contaminants in the Athabasca River if treated OSMW were to be released. The models showed that while concentrations would be highest near the discharge points, they would decrease with distance and dilution.
    
- **Human and Ecological Health Risks:** The reports conclude that the risks to both human health and the environment from the release of treated OSMW are likely to be low. However, the authors note some uncertainties, particularly regarding ions, aluminum, naphthenic acids, and petroleum hydrocarbons, which would require further investigation.
    
- **Treatment Technologies and Effluent Limits:** The research indicates that current and emerging treatment technologies can significantly reduce the concentration of contaminants in OSMW. The reports provide a preliminary range of potential concentration-based limits for treated water.
    
- **Toxicity Testing:** A framework for toxicity testing is proposed to ensure that any released water is not harmful to aquatic life. This framework includes a suite of tests to be used at different stages of the regulatory process.
    
- **Monitoring Programs:** The reports outline the need for both an enhanced monitoring program to detect any changes in the Athabasca River and a local-scale Environmental Effects Monitoring (EEM) program to assess the effects of any specific release on the local aquatic environment.
    

**In conclusion, these reports provide a comprehensive scientific basis for potential future policy and regulation of treated OSMW. They identify key substances of concern that would need to be managed and emphasize that any actual application to release treated water would require further detailed, site-specific assessments to ensure the protection of the environment and human health.**
