### **Preamble: An Evolving Context for Water Management**   

The Government of Alberta's recent commitment to establish water release standards, following recommendations from the Oil Sands Mine Water Steering Committee (OSMWSC), represents a significant policy development for the oil sands industry. This development initiates a shift from a long-term strategy of **containment** towards one that includes active **treatment, release, and reclamation.** 

This operational shift increases the importance of monitoring and verification. As operators prepare for this transition, there is a heightened need for robust, transparent, and high-frequency data. Regulators, operators, and Indigenous and local communities have all emphasized the need for this process to be managed with careful oversight. 

This technical brief addresses the role of monitoring technology in this evolving context. It outlines an operational data gap that emerges from this shift and presents a validated, peer-reviewed technology as a potential tool to help address it.

### **1. The Monitoring Challenge in OSPW Management**     
The shift toward active treatment requires a different approach to monitoring. Effective management of treatment systems benefits from a near real-time data feedback loop for process control. Current monitoring approaches, however, present an operational data gap.  

**The Standard:** High-Resolution Mass Spectrometry (HRMS) is the established standard for the forensic, chemical characterization of Naphthenic Acids (NAs).  
**The Challenge:** For the application of high-frequency operational monitoring, HRMS is constrained by several factors:
	**Specialized Personnel:** Operation requires highly-trained, graduate-level personnel who can be challenging to retain for routine, operational work, creating a human resource bottleneck.   
	**Cost:** The cost per sample can be prohibitive for the frequency of testing needed for active process management. 
	**Time-Lag:** Sample turnaround times of several weeks deliver historical data, making it difficult to use for proactive process control. 

This gap between the need for real-time data and the capabilities of the standard compliance tool can make proactive management of treatment systems challenging.

### **2. A Tier 2 Monitoring Technology** 

This brief outlines a peer-reviewed, field-validated **Tier 2 monitoring technology** intended to complement, not replace, HRMS. 	

**Positioning:** A high-frequency screening and process optimization tool.        **Operational Design:** In contrast to the specialized requirements of HRMS, the biosensor platform is designed for operational simplicity. The testing protocol is a repeatable process that can be reliably executed by a trained technician with a diploma.
**Primary Use Case:** To provide accessible, operational data for process monitoring between HRMS compliance sampling events.

### **3. Technology and Validation Data**
#### **3.1. Scientific Foundation** 
The technology consists of a panel of whole-cell bacterial biosensors developed at **Athabasca University and the University of Calgary**, and validated in the peer-reviewed journal ***ACS Synthetic Biology*** (Bookout et al., 2024). This multi-sensor approach provides a more nuanced "fingerprint" of the NA composition, rather than a single bulk  measurement. 
#### **3.2. Performance Metrics**  

**Analysis Time:** Provides quantitative results within **24 hours**.
**Sample Matrix:** Designed to work with raw OSPW with minimal sample preparation.
**Detection Limits:** Aggregate limits of **2-30 mg/L**, dependent on NA mixture composition and the specific biosensor response.  
**OSPW Field Validation:** Successfully detected NAs in **22 out of 24** unique raw OSPW samples, demonstrating performance in the target matrix.
#### **3.3. HRMS Correlation** 

For an operational tool, the primary objective is to provide reliable trend data that tracks with the reference method, allowing operators to confirm if a process is working as expected. The platform has been rigorously compared against Orbitrap-MS to validate this capability.   

**Controlled Mesocosm Studies:** In greenhouse studies tracking NA biodegradation biosensor data showed a **strong, statistically significant correlation** with Orbitrap-MS results, consistently tracking degradation trends. 
**Large-Scale Field Pilot:** In a multi-season deployment at a large-scale constructed wetland, the platform demonstrated **strong qualitative agreement and visual concordance** with HRMS. It successfully tracked the reduction of total NAs from ~70 mg/L to below the platform's signal loss threshold, mirroring the trend identified by concurrent MS analysis. 

This validation suggests the platform can be a useful tool for tracking the efficacy of remediation processes.

### **4. The Confluent Data Platform: An Integrated Intelligence Hub**

An increase in monitoring frequency creates a high-volume data stream that is challenging to manage with traditional tools. The Confluent data platform is designed to serve as an integrated intelligence hub, contextualizing this new data by correlating it with other critical operational inputs.  

**Key Capabilities:** 

**Multi-Source Integration:** The platform is designed to ingest and harmonize data from multiple sources, including the biosensor panel, periodic HRMS results, treatment process inputs (e.g., chemical dosing, flow rates), SCADA system data, and external feeds like weather.   

**Holistic Process Analysis:** By correlating high-frequency NA data with other operational variables, the platform enables a more complete understanding of the treatment system, helping to identify key performance drivers and optimization opportunities. 

**Advanced Analytics:** The platform's architecture is designed to leverage modern data science, including pattern recognition and predictive modeling algorithms, to provide deeper operational insights from the integrated data set.

**Auditable Data Log:** Provides a timestamped, immutable data log for all integrated data streams to support transparent regulatory reporting and facilitate stakeholder communication.

### **5. An Integrated Monitoring Framework**  

A multi-tiered monitoring strategy can be an effective and pragmatic approach for OSPW management. By using the right tool for the right application, operators can gain operational control while maintaining regulatory certainty. 

**Tier 1 (Operational Monitoring):** High-frequency screening with a tool like the Luminous biosensor platform provides timely, cost-effective data. This enables active process control, allows for rapid assessment of treatment efficacy, and helps prioritize which samples require more intensive analysis.

**Tier 2 (Compliance & Forensic Analysis):** Definitive, low-frequency analysis using HRMS remains the essential tool for regulatory compliance reporting, final validation of water quality, and in-depth scientific investigation. 

This integrated framework offers a practical path forward. It addresses the need for high confidence operational data without challenging the role of the established reference method. It provides a mechanism for operators to optimize their systems and de-risk the transition to release, while also generating a more robust and transparent data set to share with regulators and community stakeholders.
