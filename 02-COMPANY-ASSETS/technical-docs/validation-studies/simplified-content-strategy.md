## **Publication Strategy Assessment: SIMPLIFY DRASTICALLY**

### **Original Strategy Problems:**
- **90-day timeline with daily tasks** = administrative overkill
- **4 peer-reviewed submissions** = unrealistic for early-stage company
- **Resource intensive** = distracts from revenue generation
- **Premature optimization** = need customers before thought leadership

### **Simplified Alternative:**

**Immediate (Next 30 Days):**
- Complete **one technical white paper** combining HRMS + validation data
- Submit **one conference abstract** (Oil Sands Trade Show 2025)
- Create **one-page validation summary** for technical conversations

**After First Pilot Customer (3-6 months):**
- Write **customer case study** with operational results
- Submit **one peer-reviewed paper** with real deployment data
- Present at **one industry conference** with customer validation

**After Established Revenue (6-12 months):**
- Industry **thought leadership articles**
- **Academic partnerships** for independent validation
- **Speaking opportunities** at major conferences

## **Content Creation Workflow**

### **Before Each Meeting:**

### **Monthly Content Review:**

## **Honest Assessment: What to Keep vs Archive**

### **KEEP & ACTIVATE:**
‚úÖ **HRMS Scalability Paper** - Core commercial messaging  
‚úÖ **Data Framework Study** - Technical credibility for skeptics  
‚úÖ **Core messaging framework** - Active commercial tool  
‚úÖ **Customer-specific talking points** - Direct revenue support  

### **SIMPLIFY DRASTICALLY:**
‚ö†Ô∏è **Publication Strategy** - Reduce 90-day plan to 30-day essentials  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Conference Strategy** - Focus on 1-2 high-value opportunities  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Academic Partnerships** - Maintain relationships but don't over-invest time  

### **ARCHIVE FOR LATER:**
üóÑÔ∏è **Detailed publication timelines** - Revisit after established revenue  
üóÑÔ∏è **Multiple journal submission plans** - Focus on commercial validation first  
üóÑÔ∏è **Brand awareness surveys** - Premature metrics for current stage

## **Strategic Recommendation: 80/20 Content Rule**

**80% of content effort** ‚Üí Direct commercial support:
- Customer-facing materials
- Technical validation for sales
- Pilot program documentation  
- Regulatory compliance support

**20% of content effort** ‚Üí Authority building:
- One well-executed conference presentation
- One peer-reviewed publication (after pilot success)
- Customer success stories and case studies

---

**Bottom Line:** Your existing content is excellent. Don't create more content - **execute with what you have**. Focus on converting prospects to paying customers using your current strong technical validation. Add authority content only after revenue is established.

**The best thought leadership is successful customers talking about your results.**
