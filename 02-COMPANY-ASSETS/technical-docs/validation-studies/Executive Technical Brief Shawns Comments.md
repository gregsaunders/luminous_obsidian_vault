**Shawns Comments** - I’m working on the technical brief, but I have a few questions that I need to sort out. 

1. Limits of detection are typically something important, but in my mind they aren’t so meaningful here because we need to quantitate NA before getting an estimate. That way things are 100X concentrated and the biosensors are exposed to NA at quite high concentrations. We measure the response and then make a back calculation to dilute the NA values by 100X  to estimate what their original concentration in water would be before extraction. 
   
   The other meaningful sections are regarding their “performance in OSPW” and “correlation with mass spectrometry”, which are the basis of two papers I am currently in preparation. Here I have make up something that doesn’t disclose unpublished data, an I'm not sure how to do this yet. 
   
   I think we should also make all the takeaway points of what MS can’t do, and what biosensors can do. I’m doing the correlation analysis, although this is not something I understand well, and I don’t see good correlation values using one statistical test. There are multiple methods to do this, and again, we should not expect to get the same values as orbitrap. The important part is that we can show the same trends, the decrease in NA values as NA is remediated.

**Gregs Comments** - I agree that the limit of detection isn’t a problem, i.e. just concentrate the sample, no biggie. I think the ability to show trends is probably more important than the actual numbers of NA as MS will always be part of the equation regardless.

**Shawns Comments** - Statistics are a fickle beast…. We don’t have R=0.99 that Gemini and Claude led you to believe, we have trends, and we have multiple methods!! The beauty is that we can get numbers that are close to HRMS and relevant for the concentration of NA in tailings ponds, at the low and high ranges, which is still a miracle (despite not having a Pearson coefficient close to 1). I’m exploring the various correlation methods, and will update.

Here is the introduction to my latest biosensor paper, a system that could be used to measure toxicity in treated/untreated OSPW. I’m saving that part for discussion, here is the introduction:                                                                       
- Naphthenic acids (NAs) are a complex mixture of cyclic and polycyclic alkyl-substituted carboxylic acids that accumulate in oil sands tailings as a by-product of bitumen extraction using the hot alkaline water process (Clark process)

We need to edit this:

We are Canadian owned and operated.

Our mission is to help the Alberta oil sands industry address the complex problem of Naphthenic Acid (NAs) in tailings pond water. 

We have developed a bioluminescent bacterial biosensor to address this problem. Our BioSensor provides a fast and cost effective way to monitor the presence of NA's in the water.  

We are also developing microbial solutions to accelerate remediation efforts by identifying naturally occurring bacteria that can break down NAs.

This helps water reclamation in:
- Constructed Wetlands: Our biosensors help select and enhance microbial communities that can be used in wetlands to accelerate NA degradation.

- Bioaugmentation Strategies: We can scale up the most effective bacteria and introduce them into treatment sites, dramatically improving NA breakdown rates.

- Continuous Monitoring: Unlike conventional approaches, which rely on infrequent lab tests, biosensors can provide ongoing feedback on remediation progress, ensuring treatment success.

This is significant for oil sands operators seeking cost-effective, scientifically sound reclamation strategies that align with evolving environmental regulations.

To something like this: 

We are Canadian owned and operated. Our mission is to help the Alberta oil sands industry address the complex problem of Naphthenic Acid (NAs) in tailings pond water. 
We have developed a bioluminescent bacterial biosensor to address this problem. Our BioSensor provides a fast and cost-effective way to monitor the presence of NA's in the water. 
NA biosensors are an effective method for high volume, frequent, long-term monitoring of NA in tailings facilities and during treatment of wastewater to remediate NA.
Unlike conventional, analytical chemistry approaches to detect NA, which rely on infrequent lab tests, biosensors can provide ongoing feedback on remediation progress, ensuring treatment success.
Our sensors are also effective at identifying NA degrading microbial communities that could be used in wetlands to accelerate NA degradation using a ‘bioaugmentation’ approach. 
This technology could be significant for oil sands operators seeking cost-effective, scientifically sound monitoring and reclamation strategies that align with evolving regulations.

Aso edit this sentence.. Unlike conventional, analytical chemistry approaches to detect NA, which rely on costly, infrequent lab tests, and long wait times, biosensors can provide ongoing feedback on remediation progress, ensuring treatment success.
