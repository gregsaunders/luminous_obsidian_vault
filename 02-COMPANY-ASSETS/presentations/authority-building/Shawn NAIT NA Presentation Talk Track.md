## Slide 1: Title Slide

![[Pasted image 20250815112953.png]]

Good morning everyone. I'm Shawn Lewenza from Athabasca University and University of Calgary. Today I'll present our novel biosensor technology for rapid, high-throughput detection of naphthenic acids in oil sands process water.

## Slide 2: What is a whole cell bacterial biosensor?

![[Pasted image 20250815113014.png]]
Biosensors aren't new - we've been developing this technology since the 1990s. The concept is simple: identify genes that respond to specific pollutants, fuse those promoters to reporter genes like lux for bioluminescence, then expose bacterial cultures to samples and measure the output.

The advantages are compelling - these systems are simple, rapid, inexpensive, high-throughput, and both specific and sensitive, detecting compounds at ppm to ppb levels. We've filed a patent and published our work in ACS Synthetic Biology.

## Slide 3: Biosensor construct designs

![[Pasted image 20250815113137.png]]
We developed three generations of biosensors. First generation had dual ribosome binding sites. Second generation removed the vector RBS for better expression. Third generation added constitutive repressor expression for enhanced sensitivity. Each iteration improved performance.

## Slide 4: The mar resistance and efflux operon

![[Pasted image 20250815113156.png]]
Our first biosensor targets the marR operon, which responds to complex naphthenic acids and antimicrobials like fusaric acid. You can see strong dose-dependent responses to various NA mixtures. The specificity data shows it responds best to complex structures like fusaric acid and tetrahydro-naphthoic acid.

## Slide 5: Hypothetical protein biosensor

![[Pasted image 20250815113212.png]]
This biosensor targets a hypothetical protein linked to lipid metabolism. It's our most sensitive detector, responding to classical NAs like cyclopentane and cyclohexane carboxylic acids. Detection limits reach 2-4 mg/L for the 9xNA mixture.

## Slide 6: The atu fatty acid degradation cluster

![[Pasted image 20250815113241.png]]
The atuA biosensor responds to acyclic fatty acids. It shows strong responses to medium-chain fatty acids but doesn't cross-react with alkanes, BTEX compounds, or terpenes. This gives us specificity for acyclic naphthenic acids.

## Slide 7: Mass spectrometry analysis

![[Pasted image 20250815113305.png]]
This slide shows why we need different biosensors. Commercial Sigma-Aldrich NAs are mostly acyclic compounds, while industry NAFCs contain predominantly 2-3 ring structures. Our biosensor panel covers this diversity.

## Slide 8: Dose response curves

![[Pasted image 20250815113323.png]]
Here are our detection limits: atuA detects 15-30 mg/L, marR detects 7-15 mg/L, and p3680 is most sensitive at 2-4 mg/L. All show excellent dose-response linearity suitable for quantitative analysis.

## Slide 9: Detection of NA in OSPW

![[Pasted image 20250815113340.png]]
Real-world validation is crucial. Testing NAFC extracts at ~40 mg/L, we detected NAs in 11 of 24 samples. With raw OSPW samples, 22 of 24 samples were detected by at least two biosensors. This demonstrates practical utility.

## Slide 10: Biosensors for monitoring degradation

![[Pasted image 20250815113433.png]]
We can scale down for high-throughput screening. This 96-well format uses just 100 μL samples with 1 μL biosensor culture. It's perfect for rapid screening of NA-degrading bacteria or monitoring treatment processes.

## Slide 11: Monitoring NA degradation results

![[Pasted image 20250815113509.png]]
We tested OSPW-derived Pseudomonas isolates for NA degradation capability. The p3680 biosensor successfully identified strains that degraded NAs, showing decreased signal in cell-free supernatants compared to positive controls.

## Slide 12: LC-QTOF-MS confirmation

![[Pasted image 20250815113547.png]]
Vogon Labs confirmed our biosensor results with LC-QTOF-MS. Four bacterial strains degraded 3-5 compounds from the 9xNA mixture. These validated strains could be used for bioaugmentation in constructed wetlands.

## Slide 13: GROW Genomics project

![[Pasted image 20250815113715.png]]
Our biosensors integrate with the larger GROW Genomics project. We test both greenhouse mesocosms and full-scale constructed treatment wetlands. The mesocosms operate with ~30 L/day flow, while the field system handles 400 m³/day.

## Slide 14: Orbitrap MS validation in mesocosms

![[Pasted image 20250815113755.png]]
Orbitrap MS data shows excellent NA removal in vegetated treatments, with R values of -0.97 to -0.99. Our biosensors tracked these same trends, validating the technology against gold-standard analytical methods.

## Slide 15: Agar spot plate method

![[Pasted image 20250815113822.png]]
For field deployment, we developed this simplified method. Concentrate samples 80-160 fold, spread biosensor on agar, spot samples, incubate overnight, and image luminescence. It's much simpler than liquid culture methods.

## Slide 16: Mesocosm treatment results

![[Pasted image 20250815113850.png]]
These plates show biosensor responses across different treatment conditions and time points. You can see signal intensity decreasing with treatment time, correlating with NA removal. Each biosensor shows different response patterns.

## Slide 17: Constructed wetland monitoring

![[Pasted image 20250815113923.png]]
We've successfully monitored the full-scale Kearl wetland. Orbitrap MS shows ~70 mg/L decreasing to ~40 mg/L over the treatment season. Our biosensors tracked these changes in real-time.

## Slide 18: Field wetland biosensor results

![[Pasted image 20250815113957.png]]
These plates show responses from different wetland cells over time. You can see signal loss as NA concentrations drop below ~36 mg/L. Different cell locations show varying treatment efficacy.

## Slide 19: Biosensor specificity summary

![[Pasted image 20250815114051.png]]
This diagram summarizes our three-biosensor panel. patuA detects medium-length fatty acids, pmarR detects complex NAs, and p3680 detects classical NAs. Together, they don't respond to alkanes, BTEX, or terpenes, giving us NA-specific detection.

## Slide 20: Summary

![[Pasted image 20250815114117.png]]
Key points: Biosensor data available in 24 hours. Minimal sample preparation required. Qualitative data shows NA detection and treatment progress. Signal lost below 32-36 mg/L due to camera limitations. Results correlate well with mass spectrometry. We're developing quantitative methods and using these tools to identify effective NA degraders.

## Slide 21: Luminous BioSolutions

![[Pasted image 20250815114137.png]]
We're commercializing this technology through Luminous BioSolutions. Our website is luminousbiosolutions.com. We're developing both biosensor testing services and a bioaugmentation approach, adding proven NA-degrading bacteria to treatment systems to accelerate remediation.

That concludes my presentation. I'm happy to take questions about our biosensor technology or its applications in oil sands water treatment.
