**TITLE:**
How We Got Here: A Unique Challenge

**LEFT SIDE TEXT:**
**Traditional Mining Operations:**
- Gold, copper, diamond mines
- Regulatory approval to release treated water

**Oil Sands Operations:**
- No regulatory approval for water release
- Containment strategy for decades

**RIGHT SIDE (Key Stats with Icons):**

⚠️ **The NA Bottleneck**
Naphthenic acids—one of the principal contaminants preventing regulatory approval for water release

⏳ **Decades Recalcitrant**
NAs don't break down predictably like other contaminants

🔒 **Containment Mode**
Minimal operational NA monitoring required

---

### Speaker Notes (Timing: 2 minutes):

**CONTEXT SETTING (90 seconds):**

> "Oil sands operations face a challenge unlike any other mining sector.
>
> Gold mines, copper mines, diamond mines—they all have regulatory approval to release treated water once they hit certain environmental targets. It's a standard part of their operational lifecycle.
>
> Oil sands operations have never had that approval.
>
> Why? **Naphthenic acids.** These compounds are toxic and recalcitrant—they don't break down predictably like other contaminants. They're one of the principal contaminants of concern preventing regulatory approval for water release.
>
> Now, to be clear: operators need to address multiple contaminants—metals like arsenic and selenium, salts, suspended solids, other organics. But NAs are the specific bottleneck holding back release approval. You can't get regulatory approval if NA levels aren't demonstrated to be safe, regardless of other contaminants.
>
> So for decades, the only viable strategy was containment.
>
> Build larger ponds. Recycle water. Don't release anything.
>
> That created what we see today: **1.4 trillion liters of water covering 300 square kilometers.** To put that in perspective, that's roughly the size of the City of Calgary.
>
> Because operators weren't planning to release water, there was no need for rigorous operational NA monitoring. Quarterly HRMS compliance samples for NA analysis were sufficient.
>
> That lack of continuous NA monitoring contributed to the trust challenges we see today."

**TRANSITION (30 seconds):**

> "So we have significant water volumes, no release pathway, and a monitoring infrastructure designed for containment, not NA treatment.
>
> And then multiple pressures began to converge."

---

### Speaker Notes (Timing: 2 minutes):

**SETTING UP THE CONTEXT (2 minutes):**

> "Multiple pressures are now converging simultaneously—all pointing to the need to address the NA bottleneck.
>
> **Economic context:** Alberta has announced plans to double oil production over the coming decade. That's economically important for the province, but it requires significantly more water. We're already approaching tailings capacity limits. Without demonstrating NA reduction and water release capability, this creates potential production constraints.
>
> **Physical constraints:** Continued expansion of tailings facilities has limits. The physical footprint is already 300 square kilometers. There are engineering, environmental, and regulatory limits to continued growth. NA treatment systems need to be proven effective to enable water release.
>
> **Regulatory momentum:** These pressures led to the formation of the Oil Sands Mine Water Steering Committee in 2024. In September 2025, the Alberta government made a public commitment to establishing water release guidelines within 12-18 months. Naphthenic Acids are explicitly identified as one of the key contaminants of concern that must be addressed for release approval.
>
> **Social license:** Indigenous communities, environmental groups, and local stakeholders are demanding accountability specifically on NA levels. After past incidents where operators couldn't independently verify NA contamination quickly, trust is at historic lows. They want verifiable proof that NA levels are safe.
>
> All of this is converging on the NA challenge. The status quo—indefinite containment—is no longer sustainable.
>
> Which brings us to the trust question."

**TITLE:**
The Trust Challenge: NA Transparency Through Verifiable Data

**LEFT SIDE - THE CONTEXT:**

**Historical Issues:**
- Past incidents: Inability to rapidly verify NA contaminants
- Minimal operational NA monitoring during containment era
- NA data gaps undermining confidence

**Current Skepticism:**
- Indigenous communities hiring independent toxicologists to verify NA levels
- Scrutiny of regulatory frameworks for potential loopholes on NA release criteria
- Environmental groups questioning NA treatment efficacy

**The Requirement:**
Verifiable, transparent, real-time NA data demonstrating treatment effectiveness

---

**RIGHT SIDE - CALLOUT BOX (Luminous Teal Background, White Text):**

**"If you drink the water, we will consider letting you release it into our lands."**

— Indigenous Community Statement

**Subtext (smaller):**
They want proof NA levels (and other contaminants) are safe. Not promises. Proof.

---

### Speaker Notes (Timing: 2 minutes):

**EXPLAINING THE TRUST CHALLENGE (2 minutes):**

> "Here's why trust is so critical—and so fragile—especially around the NA issue.
>
> When incidents occurred in the past, operators couldn't quickly verify what NA contaminants were present or at what concentrations. HRMS testing for NAs takes 6-8 weeks. By the time results came back, the incident was over, and stakeholders were left with questions about what really happened with NA levels.
>
> That lack of real-time NA monitoring capability contributed to ongoing skepticism.
>
> During the containment era, there simply wasn't a need for continuous operational NA monitoring. Quarterly compliance samples for NA analysis were sufficient because water wasn't going anywhere. But that also meant there wasn't a comprehensive dataset demonstrating active management of NA levels.
>
> Now, as we transition to active treatment and potential release, that NA data gap is a significant barrier to trust.
>
> Indigenous communities have hired their own toxicologists and environmental scientists. They're scrutinizing every aspect of the regulatory framework, looking for potential gaps in NA release criteria. They're not accepting assurances about NA levels—they want verifiable proof.
>
> And they've set the bar clearly: [PAUSE] **'If you drink the water, we will consider letting you release it into our lands.'**
>
> To be clear: they want proof that all contaminants are safe—metals, salts, NAs, everything. But NAs are specifically the bottleneck because they're one of the principal contaminants preventing regulatory approval.
>
> That's the standard. Meeting that standard requires a level of NA monitoring rigor, transparency, and verifiable data that hasn't existed in oil sands operations.
>
> So what's preventing that? The NA monitoring gap."

**TITLE:**
The NA Monitoring Gap: When Requirements Change

**TIMELINE GRAPHIC:**

**← CONTAINMENT ERA (Gray/Muted Colors)**

**NA Monitoring Approach:**
- Quarterly HRMS compliance samples for NA analysis
- 6-8 week turnaround acceptable
- Historical NA data sufficient

**Requirements:**
✓ Verify water stays contained (NAs not released)
✓ Annual regulatory reporting on NA levels
✓ Minimal operational adjustments needed

---

**→ ACTIVE NA TREATMENT ERA (Teal/Vibrant Colors)**

**NA Monitoring Requirements:**
- Daily operational NA screening needed
- 24-hour turnaround essential for NA data
- Real-time NA data for process control

**New Questions:**
? Is NA treatment working RIGHT NOW?
? What adjustments optimize NA degradation performance?
? Can we prove NA reduction progress transparently?

**CENTER ARROW (Large, Bold, Coral):**
**HRMS Alone Cannot Bridge This NA Monitoring Gap**

### Speaker Notes (Timing: 2 minutes):

**DIAGNOSING THE NA MONITORING GAP (2 minutes):**

> "Here's how we got to this NA monitoring gap.
>
> **During the containment era,** the NA monitoring requirements were straightforward:
> - Quarterly HRMS samples for NA analysis confirmed water stayed within acceptable parameters
> - 6-8 week turnaround times for NA results were acceptable because water wasn't being released
> - Historical NA data was sufficient for annual regulatory reports
> - There was no need for daily operational NA monitoring because operators weren't actively treating water for release
>
> That NA monitoring approach made sense for containment.
>
> **But now we're entering the active NA treatment era,** and the requirements have fundamentally changed:
> - Operators need to know: Is NA treatment working RIGHT NOW?
> - They need to optimize NA degradation processes in near real-time
> - They need to demonstrate transparent NA reduction progress to regulators and communities
> - They need high-frequency NA data to validate that treatment approaches are reducing NA levels effectively
>
> And here's the challenge: HRMS—the gold standard for regulatory compliance on NA characterization—cannot bridge this NA monitoring gap alone.
>
> Here's why."

## SLIDE 6: THE HRMS CONSTRAINT FOR NA MONITORING

### Visual Layout:
- **Three-Column Layout**
- Each column represents one constraint with icon + description

### Slide Content:

**TITLE:**
Root Cause: The HRMS Constraint for NA Monitoring

**SUBTITLE:**
When Forensic NA Analysis Tools Meet Operational Needs

---

**COLUMN 1: ⏱️ TIME-LAG CONSTRAINT (Navy)**

**6-8 Weeks for NA Results**
Sample collection → Lab analysis → NA characterization

**Impact:**
- NA treatment conditions change
- Operators adjust NA degradation processes based on historical data
- Can't validate if adjustments improved NA reduction until weeks later

**Real Example:**
Multi-season wetland study: 9 NA samples over 2 field seasons. NA degradation decline detected 6 months too late to optimize.

---

**COLUMN 2: 💰 COST CONSTRAINT (Teal)**

**$700-$1,000 per NA sample**

**Impact:**
- Constrains NA testing frequency
- Creates blind spots between NA sampling events
- New standards require 10-50x more NA monitoring
- Financially challenging to monitor NAs at operational frequency with HRMS alone

---

**COLUMN 3: 📁 DATA ACCESSIBILITY CONSTRAINT (Coral)**

**Decades of unstructured NA data**

**Impact:**
- Historical HRMS NA results in PDFs, spreadsheets
- Multiple repositories (operators, consultants, regulators)
- No unified view of NA trends across time/space
- Institutional knowledge about NA treatment in documents, not queryable systems

---

**BOTTOM CALLOUT (Gray Box):**
**HRMS was designed for forensic NA analysis, not high-frequency operational NA monitoring.**

---

### Speaker Notes (Timing: 2 minutes):

**EXPLAINING THE CONSTRAINT (2 minutes):**

> "HRMS is the gold standard for NA characterization—and rightly so. Its molecular-level precision for NA analysis is indispensable for regulatory compliance. We're not here to criticize HRMS.
>
> But using HRMS as the primary tool for operational NA monitoring creates three significant constraints:
>
> **First, the time-lag constraint for NA data.**
> 6 to 8 weeks from sample collection to NA results. By the time NA data arrives, treatment conditions have changed. Operators are adjusting NA degradation processes based on data that's weeks to months old.
>
> Here's a real example: A recent multi-season engineered wetland study collected only 9 NA samples over two full field seasons. With 8-week HRMS turnaround times for NA analysis, when natural NA degradation rates declined mid-season, operators didn't discover it until the following year's data analysis. Too late to optimize NA treatment or course-correct.
>
> **Second, the cost constraint for NA testing.**
> HRMS costs $700 to $1,000 per sample for NA characterization. That high cost constrains testing frequency. You end up with significant blind spots between NA sampling events. When new treatment standards require 10 to 50 times more NA monitoring, that's financially challenging with HRMS alone.
>
> **Third, the data accessibility constraint for NA intelligence.**
> There are decades of valuable HRMS NA results and operational data in unstructured PDFs and spreadsheets, stored across multiple repositories—operator archives, consultant reports, regulatory submissions. There's no unified view of NA trends across time, space, or treatment approaches. All that institutional knowledge about NA treatment is in documents, not queryable systems.
>
> The fundamental issue: HRMS was designed for forensic NA analysis, not high-frequency operational NA monitoring.
>
> So what's at stake if we don't address this NA bottleneck? Here's the context."

### Speaker Notes (Timing: 2 minutes):

**ESTABLISHING SCALE (2 minutes):**

> "I want to be transparent about the scale of what we're dealing with.
>
> **1.4 trillion liters.** That's 560,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools. That's enough water to fill Lake Louise 28 times over.
>
> **300 square kilometers.** That's roughly the size of the entire City of Calgary.
>
> By any measure, this represents one of Alberta's most significant environmental management challenges.
>
> [PAUSE]
>
> Now, to be clear: this water contains multiple contaminants that must be addressed—metals, salts, suspended solids, other organics. Operators need monitoring solutions for all of these.
>
> But **Naphthenic Acids are one of the principal contaminants preventing regulatory approval for water release.** You can't get approval to release this water—even if everything else is clean—if NA levels aren't demonstrated to be safe.
>
> **Here's what's encouraging: there ARE pathways forward for NA treatment.**
>
> Engineered wetlands are showing promise for NA degradation. End pit lake strategies are being piloted. Active treatment technologies for NAs are advancing. Research from the University of Calgary, Athabasca University, and others is demonstrating that biological degradation of naphthenic acids is possible.
>
> The question isn't 'can NAs be treated?'—it's 'can we prove we're treating them effectively?'
>
> Can operators demonstrate, with verifiable NA data, that treatment is working?
> Can they optimize NA degradation processes in near real-time to improve performance?
> Can they share that NA reduction progress transparently with regulators, communities, and Indigenous nations?
>
> That's the NA monitoring challenge. Addressing that is essential for moving forward.
>
> So what does the solution look like? This is where Luminous fits."

---

### Speaker Notes (Timing: 3 minutes):

**INTRODUCING THE SOLUTION (3 minutes):**

> "We don't claim to solve the entire tailings challenge. That requires biological treatment, physical remediation, regulatory frameworks, Indigenous partnerships—all of which are beyond our scope.
>
> What we address is the NA monitoring gap—providing visibility and transparency specifically around Naphthenic Acids through a three-tier NA monitoring strategy where different tools serve different purposes.
>
> To be very clear upfront: **tailings water contains multiple contaminants that operators must monitor**—metals like arsenic and selenium, salts, suspended solids, other organic compounds. Our biosensor specifically targets Naphthenic Acids because NAs are one of the principal contaminants preventing regulatory approval. We're addressing the NA bottleneck first.
>
> **Tier 1 is HRMS for NA compliance—and it remains essential.**
> HRMS provides the molecular-level precision needed for regulatory NA compliance, forensic NA analysis, and validating new NA methods. It's the gold standard for NA characterization, and it will continue to be the gold standard. We're not replacing it.
>
> **Tier 2 is our Luminous Biosensor platform for operational NA screening.**
> This is a peer-reviewed technology—published in ACS Synthetic Biology in 2024—specifically engineered for rapid NA detection. It provides 24-hour turnaround on operational NA screening. This gives operators daily NA visibility. It bridges the gap between quarterly HRMS compliance events with continuous operational NA intelligence.
>
> **Tier 3 is Confluent, our AI-native data intelligence platform currently focused on NA data.**
> This isn't just a database. It's built from the ground up to leverage modern AI capabilities for NA intelligence. It ingests biosensor NA data, HRMS NA validation results, SCADA outputs, historical NA PDFs—all of it—and creates a unified, queryable knowledge graph specifically around NA treatment. Operators can ask questions in plain English about NA trends and get evidence-based answers.
>
> Confluent's architecture is designed to eventually integrate data from other contaminant monitoring systems—metals, salts, other organics—as operators expand their comprehensive water treatment programs. But our current focus is **the NA bottleneck**—the specific contaminant preventing water release.
>
> And importantly, Confluent provides different dashboard views for different stakeholders: operators get full operational detail on NA treatment, regulators get NA compliance metrics and audit trails, and communities get transparent, plain-language reporting on NA reduction trends.
>
> This three-tier approach is about making HRMS more valuable for NA monitoring by providing operational NA context and stakeholder transparency around that gold-standard NA data.
>
> Here's the validation."

### Speaker Notes (Timing: 2 minutes):

**ESTABLISHING CREDIBILITY (2 minutes):**

> "Here's the validation for NA detection.
>
> **First, peer-reviewed publication specifically on NA detection.**
> Our biosensor technology for Naphthenic Acid detection was published in ACS Synthetic Biology in 2024. That's one of the top journals in the field. The paper documents our three-panel detection system targeting different NA compound classes—acyclic, complex/aromatic, and classical NAs—with detection ranges from 1.5 to 30 milligrams per liter.
>
> This is peer-reviewed science specifically for NA monitoring that other researchers can replicate and build upon.
>
> **Second, field validation for NA monitoring.**
> [GESTURE TO IMAGE] What you're seeing here is our biosensor bacteria responding to naphthenic acids by producing bioluminescence.
>
> We recently completed field trials at a multi-season engineered wetland study that wrapped up in June 2025. We ran our biosensors alongside Orbitrap Mass Spectrometry—the industry gold standard for NA characterization—on real OSPW samples with minimal preparation.
>
> The results showed high correlation for NA detection. We're being conservative with language until the peer-reviewed papers on NA biosensor performance are published—we expect those by year-end 2025. But the validation for NA monitoring is there.
>
> **Third, university partnerships focused on NA research.**
> We're working with Athabasca University—which is in the heart of oil sands country and a leading center for NA research—and the University of Calgary. These are academic institutions providing independent validation and credibility for NA detection. Our Chief Science Officer, Dr. Shawn Lewenza, holds faculty positions at both universities and has spent 10+ years specifically researching Naphthenic Acids.
>
> **And finally, operational capability for NA testing.**
> This isn't just lab-scale. We can process 96 samples simultaneously for NA detection. That scales to hundreds to thousands of NA tests per day. This is built for operational NA monitoring deployment.
>
> So the science for NA detection is validated. Here's the business impact."

### Speaker Notes (Timing: 2 minutes):

**QUANTIFYING VALUE (2 minutes):**

> "Here's how this translates into measurable business outcomes specifically around NA management.
>
> **First, NA monitoring frequency.**
> Within your existing analytical budget, this approach enables a 10 to 50 times increase in NA monitoring data points. You're not spending more—you're getting comprehensive spatial and temporal coverage of NA levels for what you're already spending on sparse HRMS sampling for NAs.
>
> **Second, cost avoidance through early NA detection.**
> Early detection of NA treatment issues prevents significant losses. We had an operator describe a scenario where a treatment system began failing at NA degradation in May, but the next HRMS NA sample wasn't collected until July, with results back in September. That's a 4-month detection lag on NA treatment effectiveness. The cost: $2 to $5 million in wasted treatment inputs, plus a 12-month delay in their remediation timeline.
>
> With daily biosensor screening for NAs, that anomaly gets flagged within 72 hours. You investigate, correct the issue, and preserve the NA treatment window. The value isn't just money saved—it's maintaining project timelines and stakeholder confidence on NA reduction.
>
> **Third, compliance positioning on NA transparency.**
> Operators who establish comprehensive NA monitoring capabilities now—before release standards are finalized—gain a 12 to 18 month positioning advantage. You're not scrambling to retrofit NA monitoring infrastructure when regulations are set. You're already demonstrating good-faith effort with verifiable NA data. That's proactive positioning on the NA bottleneck.
>
> **Fourth, social license through NA transparency.**
> The multi-stakeholder dashboard capability addresses the OSMWSC September 2025 requirement for technology transparency specifically on NA levels. You can provide real-time access to communities and Indigenous nations showing verifiable NA reduction progress. That immutable audit trail of NA data—data that can't be retroactively changed—builds trust in a way that quarterly reports simply cannot.
>
> **And here's where we are commercially:**
> We're in active discussions with Pathways Alliance—that's the consortium representing all major oil sands operators: Suncor, Canadian Natural Resources, Imperial, Cenovus, ConocoPhillips, and MEG Energy—specifically about our NA monitoring solution. These conversations are progressing toward pilot program discussions.
>
> So what does a pilot look like? Here's the pathway."

### Speaker Notes (Timing: 2 minutes + Q&A setup):

**CLEAR PATHWAY FORWARD (2 minutes):**

> "So what does engagement look like for NA monitoring? We've designed a three-phase pilot program with defined success metrics at each stage.
>
> **Phase 1 is technical validation—months 1 through 6.**
> We establish that our biosensors correlate with your site-specific OSPW matrices for NA detection. We deploy the Confluent platform and start ingesting your historical NA data. We work with your team to develop stakeholder engagement frameworks specifically around NA transparency. And we train your operators on how to query the system using natural language to ask questions about NA trends.
>
> The success metric is straightforward: do we achieve high correlation with HRMS for NA detection? Can we structure your historical NA data? Can your team use the platform effectively to track NAs? If yes, we move forward.
>
> **Phase 2 is operational deployment—months 7 through 18.**
> We're providing daily biosensor screening for NAs with quarterly HRMS validation maintaining confidence in NA compliance. We're integrating additional data sources—SCADA outputs, weather data, NA treatment operation logs. We're deploying the multi-stakeholder dashboards so regulators and communities can see NA reduction progress in real-time.
>
> Success here means demonstrating that 10 to 50 times NA monitoring increase, validating early detection capabilities for NA issues, and getting stakeholder feedback that transparency on NA levels is working.
>
> **Phase 3 is scale and leadership—month 19 onward.**
> We expand across multiple sites and NA treatment approaches. We provide cross-site comparative analysis of NA degradation identifying best practices. We automate regulatory reporting for NA compliance. And we help you document your compliance leadership positioning on NA transparency through industry case studies.
>
> The outcome: you have comprehensive NA monitoring coverage, verifiable transparent progress on NA reduction, and the data packages needed to support regulatory approval for water release.
>
> **We're proposing a phased approach** where each stage has clear go/no-go decision points. You validate the technology works for your specific NA monitoring needs before scaling.
>
> **Three ways to engage:**
>
> 1. **Technical briefing:** 45 to 60 minutes with our technical team—Dr. Shawn Lewenza, our Chief Science Officer who has 10+ years of NA research experience, and Greg Saunders, our CTO—where we dive deeper into NA validation data, platform architecture for NA intelligence, and site-specific application.
>
> 2. **Pilot program discussion:** Collaborative design of a custom NA monitoring program tailored to your operations, timeline, and success criteria.
>
> 3. **Partnership exploration:** For engineering consultants or operators interested in longer-term strategic relationships around NA management.
>
> I'll leave behind our Executive Brief [HOLD UP DOCUMENT] which provides more detail on the three-tier NA monitoring strategy, Confluent's AI-native architecture for NA intelligence, and quantified business impact.
>
> **[PAUSE]**
>
> The challenge we're facing in Alberta is significant. 1.4 trillion liters. 300 square kilometers. Trust challenges. Production capacity constraints. Regulatory timelines accelerating.
>
> And Naphthenic Acids are one of the principal contaminants preventing regulatory approval for water release.
>
> NA treatment technologies are advancing. Regulators are committed to establishing pathways. And operators are ready to move from containment to active NA management.
>
> What's been missing is the NA monitoring infrastructure to prove NA treatment is working and the transparency to build trust around NA reduction.
>
> That's what we address.
>
> **I'm happy to take questions now, or we can continue the conversation afterward.**
>
> Thank you."

## APPENDIX: ANTICIPATED QUESTIONS & RESPONSES

### Q: "How does your biosensor compare to FTIR screening for NAs?"

**Response:**
"Great question. FTIR is fast and inexpensive, but it lacks specificity—it measures total acidity, not NA-specific compounds. It can't distinguish toxic naphthenic acids from harmless naturally-occurring organic acids like humic and fulvic acids. That creates false positives.

Our biosensor panel provides compound-class specificity for NAs. We're detecting naphthenic acids specifically, not just any acidic compound. That specificity is why we see high correlation with Orbitrap Mass Spec for NA characterization, which FTIR doesn't achieve.

So FTIR might tell you 'there's acidity.' Our biosensor tells you 'there are naphthenic acids of this specific class at this concentration.' That's the difference between screening and actionable NA intelligence."

---

### Q: "What about other contaminants like metals and salts? Don't operators need to monitor those too?"

**Response:**
"Absolutely correct, and I want to be very clear about this: operators must monitor multiple contaminants—metals like arsenic and selenium, salts, suspended solids, other organic compounds.

Our biosensor specifically targets Naphthenic Acids because **NAs are one of the principal contaminants of concern preventing regulatory approval for water release.** You can't get release approval if NA levels aren't demonstrated to be safe, regardless of how clean everything else is.

We're addressing the NA bottleneck first because that's what's blocking progress right now.

Confluent's architecture—our data platform—is designed to eventually integrate monitoring data from other contaminant systems. As operators expand their comprehensive water treatment programs to address metals, salts, and other organics, Confluent can incorporate that data too.

But today, our focus and our expertise is the NA monitoring gap."

---

### Q: "What if regulators don't accept biosensor data for NA compliance?"

**Response:**
"We completely expect that—and that's why we designed a three-tier strategy, not a replacement strategy for NA monitoring.

HRMS will remain the regulatory gold standard for NA compliance reporting and final release authorization. We're not challenging that.

What we're providing is operational NA screening between those compliance events. Think of it like this: HRMS is your annual physical exam for NA levels. Our biosensor is your daily fitness tracker for NAs. You need both.

The biosensor gives you continuous operational visibility to optimize NA treatment. HRMS validates that your NA optimization is working and provides the regulatory-grade NA data for official submissions.

We specifically designed this as complementary for NA monitoring, not competitive."

---

### Q: "This sounds expensive. What's the actual cost per NA test?"

**Response:**
"I appreciate the direct question. We're still finalizing commercial pricing, but here's the framework:

Biosensor cost per NA test will be a small fraction of HRMS—we're targeting 10 to 20% of HRMS cost.

But more importantly, the value proposition isn't about cost per sample—it's about total NA monitoring program cost and outcomes.

With HRMS alone at $1,000 per sample for NA analysis, if you want daily NA monitoring across 10 sampling points for one field season, that's $1.8 million for 180 days.

With our three-tier approach, you might spend $200K on daily biosensor NA screening across all 10 points, plus $50K on quarterly HRMS NA validation—$250K total for the same time period with far more NA data.

That's 10 to 50 times more NA monitoring for a fraction of the cost. And the business value—early detection preventing NA treatment failures, optimization improving NA degradation performance—pays for itself with one avoided incident.

We're happy to work through specific economics for your operational context around NA monitoring."

---

### Q: "How long until Confluent is fully operational for NA data?"

**Response:**
"The backend services for NA intelligence—the graph database, vector stores, data ingestion pipeline for NA data, AI orchestration—are operational now. We can start ingesting your NA data immediately.

The frontend interfaces—the polished dashboards for NA transparency and user experience—are being finalized for Q4 2025 deployment.

What that means practically: if we started a pilot in the next month or two, we'd be ingesting your NA data, structuring your historical NA archives, and enabling natural language querying about NA trends through API access initially. Then when the frontend launches in Q4, you'd get the polished dashboard views for NA transparency on top of all that foundational work that's already been done.

So there's no waiting period to start generating value from NA intelligence. The intelligence layer for NA data is working now."

---

### Q: "What happens if you go out of business? Do we lose access to our NA data?"

**Response:**
"Excellent due diligence question. A few safeguards specifically around NA data:

First, all NA data you provide remains your data. We don't claim ownership. Our contracts specify data portability—you can export everything in standard formats at any time.

Second, Confluent is built on open-source and commercially-supported technologies—TerminusDB, PostgreSQL, standard APIs. It's not proprietary black-box architecture. If we disappeared tomorrow, your NA data isn't trapped.

Third, for pilot programs, we typically include data escrow provisions where a third party holds access credentials and data backups.

Fourth—we're backed by university partnerships focused on NA research, actively fundraising, and in discussions with major operators about NA monitoring solutions. Our goal is to become infrastructure for oil sands NA monitoring long-term. But I respect that you need to de-risk that scenario.

We're happy to structure pilot agreements with appropriate data sovereignty and continuity provisions specifically for your NA data."

---

### Q: "Can you work with our existing LIMS system for NA data?"

**Response:**
"Absolutely. Confluent is designed for integration, not replacement—including for NA data.

We have REST and GraphQL APIs specifically for connecting to Laboratory Information Management Systems for NA results, SCADA systems, historian databases—whatever operational infrastructure you're already using.

In Phase 1 of the pilot, one of our first activities is working with your IT and operations teams to map out integration points for NA data flows. We're not asking you to rip and replace anything.

The value of Confluent is that it sits on top of your existing systems and creates a unified intelligence layer specifically around NA data. Your LIMS keeps doing what it does with NA results. Your SCADA system keeps doing what it does. Confluent connects the dots and makes all of that NA-related data queryable together.

Our CTO, Greg Saunders, has 30 years of experience building enterprise integrations. This is not our first time connecting to complex operational environments."
