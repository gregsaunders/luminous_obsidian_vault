## ANIMATIONS & TRANSITIONS

### Animation Guidelines:

**General Rule:** Keep animations minimal and professional. This is a technical presentation, not a marketing pitch.

**Recommended Animations:**

1. **Title Slides:**
   - No animation or simple "Fade In"

2. **Content Slides:**
   - Bullets: "Appear" (no fancy effects)
   - Timing: "On Click" (allows you to control pacing)

3. **Diagrams/Graphics:**
   - "Fade In" or "Grow/Shrink" (subtle)
   - Timing: "On Click"

4. **Callout Boxes:**
   - "Wipe" or "Fade In"
   - Timing: "After Previous" (0.5 second delay)

**Transitions Between Slides:**
- Use consistent transition throughout
- Recommended: "Fade" (0.5 seconds)
- Avoid: Flashy transitions like "Flip" or "Cube"
