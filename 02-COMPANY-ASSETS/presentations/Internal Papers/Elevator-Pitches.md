# Luminous BioSolutions: Elevator Pitches (NA-SPECIFIC)

Version: 3.0 (Engineer-Safe)

Updated: November 2025

### 1. TWO-SENTENCE PITCH (Written)

Oil sands operators are driving blind through a regulatory minefield because standard Naphthenic Acid (NAFC) testing takes **6-8 weeks** to return data. Luminous provides a **"Mine Detector"** (24-hour Biosensor) and a **"Map"** (Relational Context Engine) that gives operators the daily visibility they need to treat toxins and secure water release.

### 2. THIRTY-SECOND PITCH (Verbal)

[The Hook]

Right now, operators can't release water because they can't see the "mines"—the toxic Naphthenic Acids. They are managing a billion-dollar liability with a 45-day blind spot.

[The Solution]

Luminous builds the Readiness Infrastructure to solve this. We deploy a 24-hour Biosensor that acts as a high-speed mine detector, identifying toxicity in real-time. We pair it with a Context Engine that automatically links that toxicity to your weather and SCADA data.

[The Proof]

We validated this at Imperial Kearl, where we found $260k/year in operational efficiencies just by seeing what the standard labs missed. Operators are asking how fast we can deploy.

### 3. ONE-MINUTE PITCH (Extended)

[The Problem]

The industry faces a hard deadline: 2027 Water Release Guidelines. But you can't release water if you can't prove it's safe. Current labs (HRMS) are the gold standard for compliance, but they are useless for control because they take 6 weeks. You can't steer a ship looking in the rear-view mirror.

[The Solution]

Luminous provides the operational headlights.

1. **The Detector:** A 3-Panel Biosensor that isolates the **Toxic Fraction** (Panel 2) every 24 hours.
    
2. **The Map:** A Relational Context Engine that connects those sensor readings to your historical PDF reports and SCADA logs.
    

[The Business Case]

We don't sell "Compliance." We sell "Efficiency." Our pilot at Kearl proved we could extend the operating season by 3 weeks and optimize flow routing, saving $260k/year. That pays for the system in 5 months.

[The Ask]

We are raising $2.5M to deploy this "Trojan Horse" strategy: using the efficiency wedge to secure the regulatory infrastructure contracts for the next decade.

### 4. EMAIL INTRODUCTION (Cold Outreach)

**Subject:** Re: 24-hour NAFC visibility (Operational Control)

Hi [Name],

As the 2027 Release Guidelines approach, the gap between "Forensic Data" (HRMS, 6 weeks) and "Operational Reality" (Daily) is becoming a critical risk.

Luminous BioSolutions closes this gap. We provide **24-hour NAFC toxicity screening** that complements your HRMS compliance sampling.

We combine a **3-Panel Biosensor** (TRL 8, validated at Kearl) with a **Relational Context Engine** that automatically correlates toxicity spikes to your weather and flow data. This gives you the visibility to:

1. **Optimize Treatment:** See the impact of process changes in hours, not months.
    
2. **Reduce Risk:** Detect toxicity "breakthrough" events immediately.
    
3. **Save Money:** Validated **$260k/year** in efficiency gains during our Kearl pilot.
    

**Zero-Friction Pilot:** We use an **Offsite Lab** model. You ship samples; we provide the dashboard. No site access permits or IT integration required.

Are you open to a 30-minute review of the Kearl data?

Best regards,

Jeff Violo
