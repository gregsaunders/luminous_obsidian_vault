## SLIDE 2: The Problem

**Title:** The $30B+ Liability Meets a Regulatory Bottleneck

**Layout:** Three-column table on left, large aerial photo of oil sands on right

### Table Structure:

|The Scale & Cost|The New Regulatory Reality|The Operational Bottleneck|
|---|---|---|
|**1.4 Trillion Litres** of toxic tailings in the Athabasca Oil Sands Region.|**OSMWSC Mandate:** Alberta is moving from "containment" to "treat and release" of Oil Sands Mine Water (OSMW).|**Expensive Monitoring:** Current HRMS compliance testing costs $700-$1,000 per sample.|
|**$30B - $130B+** Unfunded environmental liability.|**Urgent Shift:** This mandates a move from static forensic reporting to dynamic process control capabilities.|**Slow Monitoring:** Turnaround time of 6-8 weeks renders data useless for operational adjustments.|
|**Problem:** No scalable, cost-effective method for high-frequency monitoring of Naphthenic Acids required to manage treatment and achieve release compliance.|**Opportunity:** Operators have a 12-18 month timeline to establish the intelligence systems required to de-risk their water release strategy.|**Need for something new:** Operators will require 10-50x more data points to effectively optimize treatment and track progress.|

### Visual Element:
