### SPEAKER NOTES (30 seconds):

"Thank you for your time today. Before I show you the opportunity, I want you to remember one principle that drives this entire investment thesis: **You can't manage what you can't see.**

The oil sands industry has been managing 1.4 trillion liters of toxic tailings water essentially blind. They've never needed to see it—because they've never been allowed to release it. That's about to change.

What I'm going to show you is not just a monitoring technology. It's the intelligence infrastructure that makes a $30 billion liability manageable—and more importantly, **investable** for the operators who need to solve it.

Let's talk about why now, why us, and why this is a once-in-a-generation opportunity."

## SLIDE 2: The Problem

**Title:** The Blind Spot in a $30B+ Environmental Liability

**Layout:** Split screen - left side has three stacked sections with icons, right side has large aerial photo of tailings ponds

### Left Side - Three Problem Sections:

#### 1. THE SCALE (Icon: Water droplet with dollar sign)
- **1.4 trillion liters** of toxic tailings water
- **300 square kilometers** of contaminated surface area
- **$30B - $130B** unfunded environmental liability
- Alberta's oil sands operators face one of the largest industrial water remediation challenges in human history

#### 2. THE BLIND SPOT (Icon: Eye with slash through it)
- **Current monitoring:** HRMS testing costs $700-$1,000 per sample
- **6-8 week turnaround** makes data operationally useless
- **Data scarcity:** A recent multi-season wetland study collected only **9 samples over 2 field seasons**
- **The gap:** When natural treatment rates declined mid-season, it wasn't discovered until the following year—too late to optimize

#### 3. THE CONSTRAINT (Icon: Regulatory document)
- **Historic containment mode:** Oil sands operators have never had release approval (unlike other mining operations)
- **No monitoring infrastructure:** Because they never needed to treat and release, they never built the intelligence systems to manage it
- **Trust at historic low:** Past spills without ability to verify contaminants independently

### Right Side Visual:
- Large aerial photograph of oil sands tailings ponds showing the scale

### SPEAKER NOTES (90 seconds):

"Let me give you context on why this problem is so unique—and why it's never been solved.

**The oil sands are unlike any other mining operation in the world.** Copper mines, gold mines, even uranium mines—they all eventually got release approval for treated water. But oil sands? Never. For 50+ years, the regulatory answer has been: 'Keep it contained. Don't release anything.'

So operators built their entire infrastructure around **containment, not treatment**. They had no reason to invest in high-frequency monitoring. Why would you? You're not releasing the water. You're just holding it.

[PAUSE]

But here's what changed: **1.4 trillion liters doesn't just sit there forever.** Production is doubling. Physical constraints are maxing out. And Indigenous communities—whose lands these tailings ponds border—are saying: 'If you can drink the water, we'll consider letting you release it into our watershed.'

That quote isn't rhetoric. That's the level of trust that needs to be rebuilt.

**The blind spot:** Operators are managing this $30-130 billion liability with data that's 6-8 weeks old and costs $1,000 per sample. A recent engineered wetland study—a multi-million dollar treatment system—collected **9 samples over two field seasons.** When treatment effectiveness declined mid-season, they didn't find out until they analyzed the data the following year.

You can't optimize what you can't see. And right now, they're flying blind."

## SLIDE 3: Why Now?

**Title:** The Perfect Storm: Regulatory Shift Meets Operational Urgency

**Layout:** Center focal point with four arrows pointing inward, each arrow labeled with a pressure point

### Center Circle:
**12-18 MONTH WINDOW**
"Operators must establish intelligence infrastructure to de-risk water release strategy"

### Four Arrows Pointing to Center:

#### 1. REGULATORY PRESSURE (Top arrow - from government icon)
- **OSMWSC Sept 2025 Recommendations:** Alberta moving from "containment" to "treat and release" mandate
- New guidelines require stakeholder transparency and independent verification
- Operators need auditable, immutable monitoring systems

#### 2. ECONOMIC PRESSURE (Right arrow - from dollar sign icon)
- Production doubling over next decade
- Existing tailings ponds at capacity constraints
- No release = no expansion = stranded assets

#### 3. PHYSICAL PRESSURE (Bottom arrow - from beaker/treatment icon)
- Treatment technologies exist (wetlands, bioaugmentation) but need process control
- Current HRMS monitoring renders these systems un-optimizable
- **Need 10-50x more data points** to manage treatment effectively

#### 4. SOCIAL LICENSE PRESSURE (Left arrow - from handshake icon)
- Indigenous communities demand independent verification
- Public trust at historic low
- Multi-stakeholder transparency no longer optional—it's competitive advantage

### SPEAKER NOTES (90 seconds):

"So why now? Why is this a venture-backable opportunity in 2025 and not 2020 or 2030?

Because four massive pressures are converging **right now**—and they're creating a 12-18 month window where operators must build the intelligence infrastructure to de-risk their water release strategy.

**First: Regulatory pressure.** In September 2025, Alberta's Oil Sands Mine Water Steering Committee issued recommendations moving from containment to treat-and-release. This isn't a suggestion—it's a mandate. And it explicitly requires stakeholder transparency and independent verification. The old 'trust us' model is dead.

**Second: Economic pressure.** Production is projected to double over the next decade. But existing tailings ponds are at capacity. If they can't release treated water, they can't expand. And if they can't expand, billions in capital investment becomes stranded assets. The math is simple: no release = no growth.

**Third: Physical pressure.** They have treatment technologies—constructed wetlands, bioaugmentation, chemical treatments. But here's the problem: you can't optimize a treatment system when your feedback loop is 6-8 weeks and costs $1,000 per data point. They need **10 to 50 times more monitoring data** to make these systems work. That's not hyperbole—that's basic process control.

**Fourth: Social license.** Indigenous communities are demanding independent, verifiable proof. After decades of spills and broken promises, public trust is at historic lows. Multi-stakeholder transparency isn't just a nice-to-have—it's a competitive advantage. The operators who get this right will unlock their growth. The ones who don't? They'll be stuck in containment mode forever.

This is a **once-in-a-generation forcing function.** And Luminous is the only company positioned to provide the intelligence infrastructure they need."

## SLIDE 4: The Three-Tier Strategy

**Title:** How the Industry Will Solve This (And Where Luminous Fits)

**Layout:** Three columns showing the complete monitoring strategy framework

### Column 1 - TIER 1: Compliance & Validation (Navy Blue)
**Icon:** Microscope

**What it is:**
- High-Resolution Mass Spectrometry (HRMS)
- Gold standard for regulatory compliance
- Molecular-level accuracy

**The Reality:**
- **Cost:** $700-$1,000 per sample
- **Speed:** 6-8 weeks turnaround
- **Purpose:** Regulatory reporting, validation baseline

**Role:** The regulatory backstop—accurate but too slow for operations

---

### Column 2 - TIER 2: Operational Monitoring (Luminous Teal)
**Icon:** DNA helix / bacterial cell

**What's Missing:**
- High-frequency operational screening
- 24-hour turnaround for process control
- Cost-effective enough for 10-50x more samples

**The Gap:**
- No existing solution bridges HRMS accuracy and operational speed
- Treatment systems can't be optimized with 6-8 week feedback loops

**Role:** **Luminous fills this gap** ← (Callout box)

---

### Column 3 - TIER 3: Intelligence & Transparency (Coral/Orange)
**Icon:** Connected network / brain

**What's Needed:**
- Unified data platform connecting all monitoring sources
- AI-driven insights for predictive optimization
- Multi-stakeholder dashboards for transparency

**The Problem:**
- Historical data trapped in PDFs, spreadsheets
- No system of record for water treatment history
- No auditable trail for stakeholder verification

**Role:** **Confluent Platform provides this** ← (Callout box)

---

### Bottom Callout Box (spans all three columns):
**"Operators need all three tiers to succeed. HRMS exists. Luminous provides Tier 2 + Tier 3."**

### SPEAKER NOTES (90 seconds):

"Now let me show you the framework that makes this opportunity so defensible.

To solve the tailings water challenge, operators need **three tiers of monitoring**—not one. And here's the key insight: they know this. We're not selling them on the problem. They're already bought in. The question is: who's going to provide the missing pieces?

**Tier 1 is HRMS**—High-Resolution Mass Spectrometry. This is the gold standard. Molecular-level accuracy. It's what regulators require for compliance. But it costs $700 to $1,000 per sample and takes 6-8 weeks to get results. It's perfect for validation and regulatory reporting, but it's useless for operational decision-making. You can't wait two months to find out if your treatment system is working.

**Tier 2 is where the gap exists**—and where Luminous fits. Operators need high-frequency operational screening with 24-hour turnaround times and cost-effective enough to run 10 to 50 times more samples than they do today. This is the layer that enables process control. This is what lets them optimize treatment systems in real-time. And right now? **This doesn't exist.** No one provides this. Luminous does.

**Tier 3 is intelligence and transparency.** Even if you're generating high-frequency data, it's useless if it's trapped in spreadsheets and PDFs. Operators need a unified platform that connects HRMS results, biosensor data, SCADA systems, weather data, and historical reports into one auditable system of record. They need AI-driven insights that predict treatment effectiveness. And they need multi-stakeholder dashboards that provide independent verification to Indigenous communities and regulators. That's **Confluent**—our AI-native data platform.

Here's why this is so powerful: **Operators need all three tiers.** Tier 1 already exists—HRMS isn't going anywhere. But Tier 2 and Tier 3? That's Luminous. We're not replacing HRMS. We're complementing it. And that makes us a must-have, not a nice-to-have."

---

### Bottom Callout Box (spans both columns):
**"Biosensor provides operational data. Confluent transforms it into competitive advantage."**

### SPEAKER NOTES (2 minutes):

"So let's get specific. What exactly are you investing in?

**Tier 2 is our biosensor panel.** This is peer-reviewed technology published in ACS Synthetic Biology in 2024. It's a panel of engineered bacterial biosensors that glow when they detect Naphthenic Acids—the toxic compounds preventing water release.

Here's what makes it operationally game-changing:
- **Speed:** Less than 24 hours for quantitative results. Operators can make treatment decisions the same week instead of waiting 6-8 weeks.
- **Cost:** Under $100 per test versus $700 to $1,000 for HRMS. This makes high-frequency monitoring economically feasible.
- **Specificity:** It targets specific classes of NAs—not just total concentration, but which types are present. That matters for treatment optimization.
- **Detection range:** 2 to 30 milligrams per liter—exactly the operational range where treatment systems need process control.

This enables operators to go from quarterly HRMS snapshots to daily or weekly operational screening. That's a **10 to 50 times increase in monitoring frequency** at a fraction of the cost.

But here's the thing: high-frequency data is only valuable if you can make sense of it. That's where **Tier 3—Confluent—comes in.**

Confluent is our AI-native data intelligence platform. It unifies biosensor results with HRMS reports, SCADA data, flow meters, weather patterns, and—critically—historical data trapped in PDFs and spreadsheets. It creates a single system of record for water treatment history.

But it's not just a database. It's **AI-native**, meaning it's built from the ground up to leverage AI for insights:
- **Model-agnostic orchestration:** We use Claude, GPT-4, Gemini—whatever's best for the task. We're not locked into one vendor.
- **Graph database architecture:** Every data point is explicitly connected—biosensor readings to weather events to treatment adjustments to NA degradation rates.
- **Natural language querying:** An operator can ask, 'Show me all wetland sampling points where NA levels increased after heavy rain in the last three years,' and Confluent returns visualizations, trend analysis, and historical case studies.

And here's the kicker: **multi-stakeholder dashboards.** Indigenous communities, regulators, and operators all see the same data in real-time. It's auditable. It's immutable. It's independent verification. That's not just compliance—that's **competitive advantage.** The operators who crack the social license problem will unlock billions in stranded capital.

So to summarize: The biosensor provides the operational data operators have never had. Confluent transforms that data into predictive insights and verifiable transparency. Together, they're the intelligence infrastructure that makes a $30 billion liability manageable."

- Multi-season field pilot at Imperial Oil's Kearl site
- Tested on 22/24 unique raw OSPW samples with minimal preparation
- Demonstrated high correlation with Orbitrap Mass Spectrometry (gold-standard HRMS)

**Operational Proof:**
- Successfully tracked NA reduction in constructed wetland
- Detected concentration changes from ~70 mg/L down to 32-36 mg/L threshold
- Demonstrated qualitative agreement with HRMS trending over time

**Key Insight Revealed:**
- Monitoring gap discovered: only 9 samples collected over 2 field seasons
- Treatment effectiveness declined mid-season but wasn't detected until following year
- Proved the need for high-frequency operational screening

---

### Column 3: The Technical Moat

---

### Visual Elements:
- ACS Synthetic Biology journal publication preview (top right)
- Journal of Environmental Chemical Engineering publication preview (bottom right)
- Optional: Graph showing biosensor correlation with HRMS (without specific R² value)

### SPEAKER NOTES (90 seconds):

"Let me address the question every investor asks: Is this technology real? Is it validated? And what's your moat?

**First: Scientific credibility.** Our biosensor technology is peer-reviewed and published in ACS Synthetic Biology—one of the top journals in the field. This isn't a garage science experiment. It's been independently validated by experts. We also have publications in the Journal of Environmental Chemical Engineering covering field application methodology. And we have multi-layered IP protection with patents filed in Canada, the US, and under the PCT.

**Second: Field validation.** We ran a multi-season field pilot at Imperial Oil's Kearl site—one of the largest oil sands operations in the world. We tested our biosensor on 22 out of 24 unique raw OSPW samples with minimal preparation. And we demonstrated high correlation with Orbitrap Mass Spectrometry, which is the gold-standard HRMS technology. We successfully tracked NA reduction in a constructed wetland from 70 milligrams per liter down to the 32-36 threshold—proving the biosensor works in real-world operational conditions.

But here's what's even more important: **we proved the gap.** During that field study, we discovered that operators had only collected 9 samples over 2 field seasons. Treatment effectiveness declined mid-season, but they didn't discover it until they analyzed the data the following year—too late to optimize. That's a multi-million dollar treatment system flying blind. We didn't just validate our technology—we validated the need.

**Third: The moat.** Every time we deploy our biosensor and Confluent platform, we're building a proprietary dataset of NA degradation kinetics that no one else has. This data becomes the training ground for predictive models that get better with every deployment. That's a compounding intelligence moat.

And here's the competitive barrier: We're peer-reviewed. We're field-tested. We have regulatory relationships through our alignment with the OSMWSC recommendations. Any competitor trying to enter this space is starting years behind us.

Bottom line: **This is de-risked technology with a defensible moat.**"

---

### SPEAKER NOTES (2 minutes):

"Now let's talk about why this is an investable market from a venture perspective.

**First: Market size.** The total addressable market is $30 to $130 billion in unfunded environmental liability across Alberta's oil sands. 1.4 trillion liters of toxic water that needs to be treated and released over the next 20 to 30 years. This is a multi-decade remediation challenge affecting every major operator.

But here's what makes this special: **It's concentrated.** The top three operators—Canadian Natural, Suncor, and Imperial—represent over 80% of oil sands production. We're not chasing hundreds of small customers. We're targeting a handful of massive operators with deep pockets and urgent need.

**Our serviceable obtainable market—the revenue we can realistically capture in the next 18-24 months—is $6 to $20 million in annual recurring revenue.** Here's how that breaks down per operator:
- **Biosensor testing services:** $2 to $5 million annually for high-frequency screening across multiple treatment sites.
- **Confluent platform subscription:** $500K to $1 million annually in SaaS revenue.
- **Integration and professional services:** $500K to $1 million for custom API integration, historical data structuring, and training.

At full deployment, each major operator represents **$3 to $7 million in annual recurring revenue.** And that's just Phase 1.

**The expansion path is clear:**
- **Phase 1:** Secure 1-2 anchor customers in the first 12 months. Prove the solution at scale.
- **Phase 2:** Expand to the remaining major operators. Leverage case studies and OSMWSC regulatory alignment.
- **Phase 3:** Adjacent markets—mining tailings, industrial wastewater, global operations.

**Why is this market so investable?**

**It's concentrated and accessible.** Small number of massive operators means efficient capital deployment. And we have direct access through CDL Rockies mentors—Steve Laut is Vice Chair of Canadian Natural. That's not a cold call. That's a warm introduction to the largest operator in the space.

**There's a regulatory forcing function.** The OSMWSC September 2025 recommendations create a 12-18 month window where operators must establish their intelligence infrastructure. This isn't a 'nice-to-have in 5 years.' This is 'we need this yesterday.'

**It's multi-decade recurring revenue.** Treatment and release is a 20-30 year process. Monitoring isn't one-and-done—it's required throughout the entire lifecycle. And as production expands, monitoring needs expand. This is compounding, recurring revenue.

**And there are massive switching costs.** Once Confluent becomes the system of record for water treatment history—integrated into SCADA, regulatory reporting, stakeholder dashboards—operators aren't switching. The data moat compounds with every sample. The longer they use it, the more valuable it becomes.

Bottom line: **This is a concentrated, accessible, multi-decade market with a regulatory forcing function and compounding moat dynamics.** That's investable."

### SPEAKER NOTES (90 seconds):

"Let's talk about how we make money—and why this model is so attractive from an investor perspective.

**We have four revenue streams, but the first three are what matter for the next 18-24 months.**

**Revenue Stream 1: Biosensor Testing Services.** This is our primary entry point. We charge $75 to $150 per test depending on volume and complexity. For context, HRMS costs $700 to $1,000 per sample. We're 5 to 10 times cheaper, but operators will run 10 to 50 times more samples. So we're not competing on price—we're unlocking a new budget category. They're not replacing HRMS spend; they're creating a new operational monitoring line item.

We structure these as monthly retainer contracts for high-frequency operational screening. A single major operator with multiple treatment sites could easily represent $2 to $5 million annually in biosensor testing alone. And gross margins are 60-70% after lab setup.

**Revenue Stream 2: Confluent Platform.** This is where we transition from service revenue to recurring SaaS. The platform is priced at $500K to $1 million per operator annually, tiered based on data volume and user seats. Once Confluent becomes the system of record—integrated into their SCADA systems, regulatory reporting, and stakeholder dashboards—they're not switching. This is 80-90% gross margin, sticky SaaS revenue with very low churn.

**Revenue Stream 3: Professional Services.** Integration and professional services accelerate adoption and deepen lock-in. Initial setup is $200K to $500K per operator—we're structuring historical data, integrating APIs, building custom dashboards, and training their teams. Ongoing optimization services add another $50K to $150K annually. These are 50-60% margins and they make us mission-critical to their operations.

**Revenue Stream 4 is the future opportunity:** Bioaugmentation. This is TRL 3-4 right now, but the idea is simple: Once we've identified where NA degradation is slow using our monitoring platform, we can deploy microbial consortia to accelerate treatment. This is a premium add-on service that expands our TAM and leverages the infrastructure we've already built.

**Here's the model:** Land with biosensor testing. Expand to platform subscription. Deepen with professional services. By Year 2, we're targeting $3 to $5.75 million in revenue with 70% gross margins and 75%+ recurring.

And here's the kicker: **The more they use it, the more valuable it becomes.** The data moat compounds. The switching costs increase. The customer lifetime value grows.

This is not a one-time sale. This is multi-decade, recurring, high-margin revenue with compounding lock-in."

---

### Bottom Callout Box (spans all quadrants):

**"IP protects the technology. Data moat compounds the advantage. Social license unlocks the market. Regulatory timing accelerates adoption."**

### SPEAKER NOTES (2 minutes):

"Let me walk you through why Luminous wins—and why this is defensible.

**First: Intellectual Property.** We have patents filed in Canada, the US, and under the PCT. Our biosensor design, detection methods, and platform architecture are protected. We've established freedom to operate—no blocking patents. And critically, we're peer-reviewed and published in ACS Synthetic Biology. That academic credibility is a massive barrier to entry. Operators in this space are risk-averse. They trust peer-reviewed science. Competitors can't just show up with a garage prototype and win. They're starting 3 to 5 years behind us.

**Second: Proprietary Data Moat.** This is where it gets really interesting. Every time we deploy our biosensor and Confluent platform, we're generating proprietary data that no one else has. We're building a structured dataset linking NA concentrations to treatment methods, environmental conditions to degradation rates, historical trends to predictive outcomes. This data becomes the training ground for predictive models that improve with every deployment. The more customers we have, the better our predictions get. The better our predictions, the more valuable we become. That's a compounding moat with network effects. Competitors can't catch up because they don't have the data.

**Third: Social License as Competitive Advantage.** This is the insight most people miss. **Trust is the bottleneck, not technology.** Indigenous communities don't trust operators. Regulators don't trust self-reported data. The public is skeptical after decades of spills and broken promises. Luminous solves this with multi-stakeholder transparency. Confluent provides independent, auditable verification with real-time dashboards for Indigenous communities, regulators, and operators. Immutable records. Independent verification. This isn't just compliance—this is social license infrastructure. And here's the key: Operators who crack the social license problem will unlock billions in stranded capital. We're in active discussions with Mikisew Cree First Nation. We're co-developing transparency protocols. Competitors retrofitting compliance into their systems will be years behind.

And the OSMWSC September 2025 recommendations explicitly require stakeholder transparency. We didn't bolt this on—we designed for it from Day 1.

**Fourth: Regulatory and Market Timing.** The OSMWSC mandate creates a 12-18 month window where operators must establish their intelligence infrastructure. They can't wait for a "better solution" in 3 years. They need a compliant, validated system now. And Luminous is the only solution that's peer-reviewed, field-tested, and aligned with the September 2025 requirements.

We also have established relationships. CDL Rockies mentors give us direct access—Steve Laut is Vice Chair of Canadian Natural. We have field validation credibility from Imperial Kearl. And we're in active discussions with Pathways Alliance, which represents all the major operators.

Bottom line: **IP protects the technology. The data moat compounds the advantage. Social license unlocks the market. And regulatory timing accelerates adoption.** Those four advantages working together create a defensible, venture-scale opportunity."

## SLIDE 10: Competitive Positioning

**Title:** Complementary, Not Competitive: Luminous Fills the Operational Gap

**Layout:** Left side has positioning framework text, right side has revised 2x2 matrix

### Left Side - Positioning Framework:

**The Key Insight:**
"Luminous does not replace HRMS. We enable operators to use HRMS more strategically by providing high-frequency operational screening that identifies when and where to deploy expensive gold-standard testing."

**Why This Matters to Operators:**
- HRMS remains the regulatory backstop (Tier 1)
- Luminous biosensor provides operational process control (Tier 2)
- Confluent unifies both into actionable intelligence (Tier 3)

**Result:** Operators reduce total monitoring cost while increasing data quality and frequency

---

**The Complementary Value Proposition:**

**Before Luminous:**
- Operators collect 10-20 HRMS samples per year per site
- Cost: $700-$1,000 per sample
- Annual monitoring spend: $7K-$20K per site
- Result: Blind to operational trends, treatment optimization impossible

**With Luminous:**
- Operators run 100-500 biosensor tests per year per site (operational screening)
- Operators run 10-20 HRMS samples per year (validation + compliance)
- Biosensor cost: <$100 per test
- Total monitoring spend: $10K-$50K per site for biosensor + $7K-$20K for HRMS = $17K-$70K
- Result: 10-50x more data, targeted HRMS deployment, optimized treatment, regulatory compliance maintained

**Value Delivered:**
- 10-50x increase in monitoring frequency
- $2-$5M in avoided treatment costs (optimized process control)
- Maintained regulatory compliance (HRMS still used for validation)
- Multi-stakeholder transparency (Confluent provides auditable records)

- Subtitle: "Unifies all monitoring data into actionable insights"

---

### Bottom Callout Box:

**"Operators need both HRMS accuracy AND operational frequency. Luminous provides the missing operational layer while making HRMS more strategic."**

### SPEAKER NOTES (90 seconds):

"I want to be crystal clear about our competitive positioning because this is critical: **Luminous does not replace HRMS. We complement it.**

Let me explain why this matters.

HRMS—High-Resolution Mass Spectrometry—is the gold standard for regulatory compliance. It's molecular-level accuracy. Regulators require it. It's not going anywhere. But it costs $700 to $1,000 per sample and takes 6-8 weeks. That makes it perfect for validation and compliance reporting, but useless for operational decision-making.

**Luminous fills the operational gap.** Our biosensor provides high-frequency screening at a fraction of the cost. Operators can run 10 to 50 times more tests than they do today with HRMS, which gives them the operational visibility they need to optimize treatment systems in real-time.

But here's the key: **We make HRMS more strategic.** Instead of operators blindly collecting HRMS samples every quarter and hoping they captured the right moment, they use our biosensor for continuous operational screening. When the biosensor identifies an interesting trend—NA levels spiking, treatment effectiveness declining—they deploy targeted HRMS testing to validate and report to regulators.

**Before Luminous:** Operators collect 10-20 HRMS samples per year per site. Annual spend is $7K to $20K. They're blind to operational trends. Treatment optimization is impossible.

**With Luminous:** Operators run 100-500 biosensor tests per year for operational screening, plus 10-20 HRMS samples for validation and compliance. Total monitoring spend increases to $17K to $70K per site, but they get 10 to 50 times more data, optimized treatment, and maintained regulatory compliance. And critically, they avoid $2 to $5 million in treatment costs by catching inefficiencies early.

Look at the positioning matrix on the right. HRMS is Tier 1—high regulatory acceptance, low frequency. Luminous biosensor is Tier 2—operational screening, high frequency. And Confluent is the connecting layer—Tier 3—that unifies all the data into actionable insights and stakeholder transparency.

**We're not in competition with HRMS. We're in collaboration with it.** And that's what makes this so defensible. We're selling into an existing budget, not trying to displace an entrenched solution. Operators need both. We provide the missing piece."

### SPEAKER NOTES (2 minutes):

"Let me close with the roadmap and the ask.

**We're raising $1.5 million in a seed round** to execute an 18-month roadmap that gets us to Series A-ready with $3-5 million in annual recurring revenue and a clear path to $20 million ARR.

Here's the roadmap:

**Phase 1—Foundation, Months 0-6:** Close the seed round. Secure two anchor operator pilots with committed, paid deployments. Establish field lab infrastructure for high-throughput biosensor testing. Deploy the Confluent platform MVP with initial SCADA integrations. By Month 6, we have paying customers and operational deployments. This is proof that operators will pay for the solution.

**Phase 2—Validation, Months 7-12:** Convert those pilots into multi-year monitoring contracts. Achieve TRL 7+ with successful multi-site deployments. Publish additional peer-reviewed validation data to reinforce scientific credibility. Expand Confluent platform to include multi-stakeholder dashboards for Indigenous communities and regulators. By Month 12, we have $1 million-plus in annual recurring revenue and validated technology at scale. This is proof that the business model works.

**Phase 3—Scale, Months 13-18:** Expand to a third major operator. Multi-site deployments across multiple operators. Formalize Indigenous partnership—Mikisew Cree or equivalent. Prepare the Series A fundraise of $5-8 million for market expansion. By Month 18, we have $3-5 million in ARR, 75%+ recurring revenue, and a clear expansion pipeline. This is proof that we're ready to scale.

**Here's how we're deploying the $1.5 million:**

- **40%—$600,000—goes to commercial scaling:** Sales, business development, pilot execution, customer success. This is how we land and expand with anchor operators.

- **30%—$450,000—goes to market development:** Regulatory and Indigenous engagement, OSMWSC alignment, marketing, thought leadership, CDL Rockies participation. This is how we build credibility and access.

- **20%—$300,000—goes to technology optimization:** Biosensor lab scaling, Confluent platform development, API integrations. This is how we deliver on our technical promises.

- **10%—$150,000—goes to operations and working capital:** Core team salaries, legal, IP, compliance.

**Key milestones you should track:**
- **Month 0:** Close $1.5 million seed round.
- **Month 6:** Two anchor pilots launched.
- **Month 12:** $1 million-plus ARR, TRL 7 validation.
- **Month 18:** $3-5 million ARR, Series A ready.

**Why invest now?**

This is a **concentrated market with a regulatory forcing function.** Operators have a 12-18 month window to establish their intelligence infrastructure. We're peer-reviewed, field-tested, and aligned with the OSMWSC September 2025 requirements. We have direct access through CDL Rockies mentors. We have a compounding data moat. And we have a land-and-expand model that turns one customer into multi-million dollar ARR.

This is not a science project. This is a **de-risked, defensible, venture-scale opportunity with clear milestones and a path to $20 million ARR.**

**Next steps:** I have a due diligence package ready—technical validation data, financial model, IP documentation. If you want, we can arrange a site visit to Imperial Kearl where we ran our field validation. I can also make introductions to our CDL Rockies mentors and operator contacts.

We're targeting to close this round in Q1 2026. The structure is flexible—SAFE or priced equity.

**Let's talk about how you can be part of solving one of the largest industrial environmental challenges in Canada—and building a multi-decade, recurring revenue business in the process.**

Thank you."

## Q&A Preparation (Anticipated Investor Questions):

### Technical Questions:

**Q: How do you ensure biosensor accuracy in variable field conditions?**
A: Our multi-season field validation at Imperial Kearl tested 22/24 unique OSPW samples with minimal preparation. We demonstrated high correlation with gold-standard Orbitrap Mass Spectrometry across varying NA concentrations (2-70 mg/L). The biosensor panel uses multiple engineered strains targeting different NA classes, which provides redundancy and increases reliability. We validate against HRMS periodically to ensure accuracy is maintained.

**Q: What happens when operators need regulatory-grade data? Doesn't that make your biosensor irrelevant?**
A: Operators will always need HRMS for regulatory compliance—and we're not replacing it. We're complementary. Our biosensor enables 10-50x more operational screening, which helps operators identify when and where to deploy expensive HRMS testing strategically. Instead of blind quarterly sampling, they use our biosensor for continuous monitoring and deploy HRMS for targeted validation and regulatory reporting.

**Q: Is the AI in Confluent actually operational, or is this vaporware?**
A: The backend architecture is operational—graph database (TerminusDB), PostgreSQL for structured data, vector database (Qdrant) for semantic search. We're ingesting and structuring data today. The AI-native design means we're built to leverage multiple LLMs (Claude, GPT-4, Gemini) with model-agnostic orchestration. Natural language querying and advanced predictive analytics are in development for frontend deployment in Q4 2025. We're not selling vaporware—we're selling the infrastructure that makes AI valuable.

### Business Model Questions:

**Q: Why wouldn't operators just build this in-house?**
A: Three reasons: (1) **IP protection**—our biosensor technology is patented and peer-reviewed. They can't replicate it without licensing. (2) **Data moat**—we're building a proprietary dataset of NA degradation kinetics they can't access. (3) **Opportunity cost**—operators are focused on extraction and production, not building biotech R&D labs and AI platforms. They want turnkey solutions, not science projects.

**Q: What's your customer acquisition cost, and how long is the sales cycle?**
A: Oil sands sales cycles are typically 12-18 months for new technology adoption. However, the OSMWSC regulatory mandate compresses this to 6-12 months because operators must act urgently. Our CAC is low relative to enterprise SaaS because: (1) Concentrated market—only 3-5 major operators. (2) CDL Rockies mentors provide warm introductions. (3) Regulatory forcing function reduces friction. We estimate CAC of $150K-$300K per anchor customer (pilot programs, validation, integration) with LTV of $10M-$20M over 10 years (3-7M annually x multi-decade contracts).

**Q: How do you prevent commoditization? What if competitors undercut on price?**
A: The data moat prevents commoditization. Confluent becomes the system of record for water treatment history. The longer operators use it, the more valuable it becomes—historical trends, predictive models, regulatory audit trails. Switching costs are massive. Even if a competitor offered cheaper biosensor testing, they can't replicate the intelligence layer and historical data we've built. That's the moat.

### Market Questions:

**Q: What if the regulatory mandate gets delayed or watered down?**
A: Even without regulatory pressure, operators face physical and economic constraints. Tailings ponds are at capacity. Production is doubling. They need to release treated water or face stranded assets. The regulatory mandate accelerates urgency, but the operational need exists regardless. Additionally, social license pressure from Indigenous communities is intensifying independent of government timelines.

**Q: Why hasn't this been solved already? If it's such a big problem, why are you the first?**
A: Because oil sands operators have never had release approval. For 50 years, the answer was "contain it, don't release it." There was no economic incentive to invest in high-frequency monitoring. The regulatory shift to "treat and release" only happened in 2024-2025. We're not early—we're exactly on time. The market is just being created now.

**Q: Can this expand beyond oil sands?**
A: Absolutely. Phase 1 is oil sands (concentrated market, high urgency). Phase 2 is adjacent mining operations—coal mining tailings (Teck Resources), hard rock mining. Phase 3 is industrial wastewater—pulp and paper, chemical processing. The biosensor panel can be adapted to detect other contaminant classes. The Confluent platform is industry-agnostic. Oil sands is the beachhead, but the TAM expands significantly beyond Alberta.

### Team & Execution Questions:

**Q: Do you have the team to scale this operationally? Running a lab and deploying field services is hard.**
A: Yes. Jeff (COO) has 30 years commercializing technology and understands operational scaling. Dr. Lewenza (CSO) has run research labs for decades and knows biosensor production. We're raising $1.5M specifically to build field lab infrastructure and hire lab technicians for high-throughput testing. We're not trying to scale to 100 operators in Year 1—we're targeting 2 anchor customers in Year 1, which is operationally manageable.

**Q: What's your unfair advantage in getting the first customer?**
A: Three things: (1) **Field validation credibility**—we already ran a multi-season pilot at Imperial Kearl. We're not cold-calling with a science experiment. (2) **CDL Rockies mentor access**—Steve Laut (Vice Chair of Canadian Natural) is one of our mentors. That's a warm introduction to the largest operator. (3) **Indigenous engagement**—we're in active discussions with Mikisew Cree First Nation. Operators who solve social license unlock billions in stranded capital. We're positioning as the transparency infrastructure that rebuilds trust.
