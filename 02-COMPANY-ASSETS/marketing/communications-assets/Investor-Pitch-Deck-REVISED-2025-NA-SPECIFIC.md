### SPEAKER NOTES (30 seconds):

"Thank you for your time today. Before I show you the opportunity, I want you to remember one principle that drives this entire investment thesis: **You can't manage what you can't see.**

The oil sands industry has been managing 1.4 trillion liters of toxic tailings water essentially blind to Naphthenic Acids—one of the principal contaminants preventing water release. They've never needed to monitor NAs frequently—because they've never been allowed to release the water. That's about to change.

What I'm going to show you is not just an NA monitoring technology. It's the intelligence infrastructure that makes the NA bottleneck manageable—and more importantly, **investable** for the operators who need to solve it.

Let's talk about why now, why us, and why this is a once-in-a-generation opportunity."

## SLIDE 2: The Problem

**Title:** The NA Monitoring Blind Spot in a $30B+ Environmental Liability

**Layout:** Split screen - left side has three stacked sections with icons, right side has large aerial photo of tailings ponds

### Left Side - Three Problem Sections:

#### 1. THE SCALE (Icon: Water droplet with dollar sign)
- **1.4 trillion liters** of toxic tailings water
- **300 square kilometers** of contaminated surface area
- **$30B - $130B** unfunded environmental liability
- Alberta's oil sands operators face one of the largest industrial water remediation challenges in human history

**The NA Bottleneck:**
- Multiple contaminants must be addressed (metals, salts, suspended solids, organics)
- **Naphthenic Acids (NAs) are one of the principal contaminants of concern holding back regulatory approval for water release**
- Toxic, recalcitrant, bioaccumulative—and until now, impossible to monitor operationally

#### 2. THE BLIND SPOT (Icon: Eye with slash through it)
- **Current NA monitoring:** HRMS testing costs $700-$1,000 per sample
- **6-8 week turnaround** makes NA data operationally useless for treatment optimization
- **Data scarcity:** A recent multi-season wetland study collected only **9 NA samples over 2 field seasons**
- **The gap:** When natural NA degradation rates declined mid-season, it wasn't discovered until the following year—too late to optimize

#### 3. THE CONSTRAINT (Icon: Regulatory document)
- **Historic containment mode:** Oil sands operators have never had release approval (unlike other mining operations)
- **No NA monitoring infrastructure:** Because they never needed to treat and release, they never built the intelligence systems to track NA degradation
- **Trust at historic low:** Past spills without ability to independently verify NA contaminants

### Right Side Visual:
- Large aerial photograph of oil sands tailings ponds showing the scale

### SPEAKER NOTES (90 seconds):

"Let me give you context on why this problem is so unique—and why it's never been solved.

**The oil sands are unlike any other mining operation in the world.** Copper mines, gold mines, even uranium mines—they all eventually got release approval for treated water. But oil sands? Never. For 50+ years, the regulatory answer has been: 'Keep it contained. Don't release anything.'

So operators built their entire infrastructure around **containment, not treatment**. They had no reason to invest in high-frequency NA monitoring. Why would you? You're not releasing the water. You're just holding it.

[PAUSE]

But here's what changed: **1.4 trillion liters doesn't just sit there forever.** Production is doubling. Physical constraints are maxing out. And Indigenous communities—whose lands these tailings ponds border—are saying: 'If you can drink the water, we'll consider letting you release it into our watershed.'

That quote isn't rhetoric. That's the level of trust that needs to be rebuilt.

**Now, there are multiple contaminants that need to be addressed**—metals, salts, suspended solids, other organics. But **Naphthenic Acids are one of the principal contaminants of concern holding back regulatory approval.** They're toxic, recalcitrant, and bioaccumulative. And operators are managing this NA challenge with data that's 6-8 weeks old and costs $1,000 per sample.

A recent engineered wetland study—a multi-million dollar treatment system—collected **9 NA samples over two field seasons.** When NA degradation rates declined mid-season, they didn't find out until they analyzed the data the following year.

You can't optimize NA treatment when you can't see what's happening. And right now, they're flying blind on the specific contaminant preventing water release."

## SLIDE 3: Why Now?

**Title:** The Perfect Storm: Regulatory Shift Meets Operational Urgency

**Layout:** Center focal point with four arrows pointing inward, each arrow labeled with a pressure point

### Center Circle:
**12-18 MONTH WINDOW**
"Operators must establish NA intelligence infrastructure to de-risk water release strategy"

### Four Arrows Pointing to Center:

#### 1. REGULATORY PRESSURE (Top arrow - from government icon)
- **OSMWSC Sept 2025 Recommendations:** Alberta moving from "containment" to "treat and release" mandate
- New guidelines require stakeholder transparency and independent verification **including for NA reduction**
- Operators need auditable, immutable NA monitoring systems

#### 2. ECONOMIC PRESSURE (Right arrow - from dollar sign icon)
- Production doubling over next decade
- Existing tailings ponds at capacity constraints
- No NA reduction = no water release = no expansion = stranded assets

#### 3. PHYSICAL PRESSURE (Bottom arrow - from beaker/treatment icon)
- Treatment technologies exist (wetlands, bioaugmentation) but need process control
- Current HRMS NA monitoring renders these systems un-optimizable
- **Need 10-50x more NA data points** to manage treatment effectively

#### 4. SOCIAL LICENSE PRESSURE (Left arrow - from handshake icon)
- Indigenous communities demand independent verification of NA levels
- Public trust at historic low after inability to verify NA contamination in past spills
- Multi-stakeholder transparency on NA data no longer optional—it's competitive advantage

### SPEAKER NOTES (90 seconds):

"So why now? Why is this a venture-backable opportunity in 2025 and not 2020 or 2030?

Because four massive pressures are converging **right now**—and they're creating a 12-18 month window where operators must build the NA intelligence infrastructure to de-risk their water release strategy.

**First: Regulatory pressure.** In September 2025, Alberta's Oil Sands Mine Water Steering Committee issued recommendations moving from containment to treat-and-release. This isn't a suggestion—it's a mandate. And it explicitly requires stakeholder transparency and independent verification—including for Naphthenic Acids, which are identified as one of the key contaminants of concern. The old 'trust us' model is dead.

**Second: Economic pressure.** Production is projected to double over the next decade. But existing tailings ponds are at capacity. If they can't demonstrate NA reduction and release treated water, they can't expand. And if they can't expand, billions in capital investment becomes stranded assets. The math is simple: no NA reduction = no release = no growth.

**Third: Physical pressure.** They have treatment technologies—constructed wetlands, bioaugmentation, chemical treatments. But here's the problem: you can't optimize NA degradation when your feedback loop is 6-8 weeks and costs $1,000 per data point. They need **10 to 50 times more NA monitoring data** to make these systems work. That's not hyperbole—that's basic process control for NA treatment.

**Fourth: Social license.** Indigenous communities are demanding independent, verifiable proof that NA levels are safe. After decades of spills where operators couldn't verify NA contamination independently, public trust is at historic lows. Multi-stakeholder transparency on NA data isn't just a nice-to-have—it's a competitive advantage. The operators who get this right will unlock their growth. The ones who don't? They'll be stuck in containment mode forever.

This is a **once-in-a-generation forcing function.** And Luminous is the only company positioned to provide the NA intelligence infrastructure they need."

## SLIDE 4: The Three-Tier NA Monitoring Strategy

**Title:** How the Industry Will Solve the NA Bottleneck (And Where Luminous Fits)

**Layout:** Three columns showing the complete NA monitoring strategy framework

### Column 1 - TIER 1: NA Compliance & Validation (Navy Blue)
**Icon:** Microscope

**What it is:**
- High-Resolution Mass Spectrometry (HRMS)
- Gold standard for regulatory compliance
- Molecular-level NA characterization

**The Reality:**
- **Cost:** $700-$1,000 per sample
- **Speed:** 6-8 weeks turnaround
- **Purpose:** Regulatory reporting, NA validation baseline

**Role:** The regulatory backstop for NA compliance—accurate but too slow for operations

---

### Column 2 - TIER 2: NA Operational Monitoring (Luminous Teal)
**Icon:** DNA helix / bacterial cell

**What's Missing:**
- High-frequency operational NA screening
- 24-hour turnaround for NA process control
- Cost-effective enough for 10-50x more NA samples

**The Gap:**
- No existing solution bridges HRMS NA accuracy and operational speed
- NA treatment systems can't be optimized with 6-8 week feedback loops

**Role:** **Luminous fills this NA monitoring gap** ← (Callout box)

---

### Column 3 - TIER 3: NA Intelligence & Transparency (Coral/Orange)
**Icon:** Connected network / brain

**What's Needed:**
- Unified data platform connecting all NA monitoring sources
- AI-driven insights for predictive NA degradation optimization
- Multi-stakeholder dashboards for NA transparency

**The Problem:**
- Historical NA data trapped in PDFs, spreadsheets
- No system of record for NA treatment history
- No auditable trail for stakeholder verification of NA reduction

**Role:** **Confluent Platform provides this (initially for NA data, expandable to other contaminants)** ← (Callout box)

---

### Bottom Callout Box (spans all three columns):
**"Operators need all three tiers to succeed on NA management. HRMS exists. Luminous provides Tier 2 + Tier 3 for the NA bottleneck."**

### SPEAKER NOTES (2 minutes):

"Now let me show you the framework that makes this opportunity so defensible.

To solve the NA bottleneck in tailings water, operators need **three tiers of NA monitoring**—not one. And here's the key insight: they know this. We're not selling them on the problem. They're already bought in. The question is: who's going to provide the missing pieces?

Now, let me be clear: **tailings water contains multiple contaminants**—metals like arsenic and selenium, salts, suspended solids, other organic compounds. Operators need to monitor all of these. But **Naphthenic Acids are one of the principal contaminants of concern preventing regulatory approval for water release.** They're toxic, recalcitrant, and bioaccumulative. And right now, operators have no way to monitor NAs at the frequency needed to optimize treatment.

**Tier 1 is HRMS**—High-Resolution Mass Spectrometry. This is the gold standard for NA characterization. Molecular-level accuracy. It's what regulators require for NA compliance. But it costs $700 to $1,000 per sample and takes 6-8 weeks to get results. It's perfect for validation and regulatory reporting of NA levels, but it's useless for operational decision-making on NA treatment. You can't wait two months to find out if your NA degradation system is working.

**Tier 2 is where the gap exists**—and where Luminous fits. Operators need high-frequency operational NA screening with 24-hour turnaround times and cost-effective enough to run 10 to 50 times more samples than they do today. This is the layer that enables NA process control. This is what lets them optimize NA treatment systems in real-time. And right now? **This doesn't exist for NA monitoring.** No one provides this. Luminous does.

**Tier 3 is NA intelligence and transparency.** Even if you're generating high-frequency NA data, it's useless if it's trapped in spreadsheets and PDFs. Operators need a unified platform that connects HRMS NA results, biosensor NA data, SCADA systems, weather data, and historical NA reports into one auditable system of record for NA treatment history. They need AI-driven insights that predict NA degradation effectiveness. And they need multi-stakeholder dashboards that provide independent verification of NA reduction to Indigenous communities and regulators. That's **Confluent**—our AI-native data platform.

Now, Confluent's architecture is designed to eventually integrate data from other contaminant monitoring systems—metals, salts, other organics. But our current focus is **the NA bottleneck**—the specific contaminant preventing water release.

Here's why this is so powerful: **Operators need all three tiers for NA management.** Tier 1 already exists—HRMS isn't going anywhere. But Tier 2 and Tier 3 for NA monitoring? That's Luminous. We're not replacing HRMS. We're complementing it. And that makes us a must-have for solving the NA bottleneck, not a nice-to-have."

---

### Bottom Callout Box (spans both columns):
**"Biosensor provides operational NA data. Confluent transforms it into competitive advantage."**

**Note:** *While Luminous currently focuses on the NA bottleneck, Confluent's architecture is designed to integrate monitoring data from other contaminants (metals, salts, organics) as operators expand their comprehensive water treatment programs.*

### SPEAKER NOTES (2 minutes 15 seconds):

"So let's get specific. What exactly are you investing in?

**Tier 2 is our biosensor panel.** This is peer-reviewed technology published in ACS Synthetic Biology in 2024. It's a panel of engineered bacterial biosensors that glow when they detect **Naphthenic Acids**—the toxic compounds that are one of the principal contaminants preventing water release.

Let me be clear about what this biosensor does and doesn't do: **It specifically targets Naphthenic Acids.** Operators need to monitor other contaminants too—metals like arsenic, salts, suspended solids. But NAs are the regulatory bottleneck. And our biosensor is the first technology that can monitor NAs at operational frequency.

Here's what makes it operationally game-changing for NA management:
- **Speed:** Less than 24 hours for quantitative NA results. Operators can make NA treatment decisions the same week instead of waiting 6-8 weeks.
- **Cost:** Under $100 per NA test versus $700 to $1,000 for HRMS. This makes high-frequency NA monitoring economically feasible.
- **Specificity:** It targets specific classes of NAs—not just total NA concentration, but which types are present. That matters for NA treatment optimization.
- **Detection range:** 2 to 30 milligrams per liter of NA concentration—exactly the operational range where NA treatment systems need process control.

This enables operators to go from quarterly HRMS NA snapshots to daily or weekly operational NA screening. That's a **10 to 50 times increase in NA monitoring frequency** at a fraction of the cost.

But here's the thing: high-frequency NA data is only valuable if you can make sense of it. That's where **Tier 3—Confluent—comes in.**

Confluent is our AI-native data intelligence platform. It unifies biosensor NA results with HRMS NA reports, SCADA data, flow meters, weather patterns, and—critically—historical NA data trapped in PDFs and spreadsheets. It creates a single system of record for NA treatment history.

**Our current focus is NA intelligence**—the bottleneck preventing water release. But here's what's important: Confluent's architecture is designed to eventually integrate monitoring data from other contaminants. As operators expand their comprehensive water treatment programs to address metals, salts, and other organics, Confluent can incorporate that data too. But today, we're laser-focused on solving the NA bottleneck first.

But it's not just a database. It's **AI-native**, meaning it's built from the ground up to leverage AI for NA insights:
- **Model-agnostic orchestration:** We use Claude, GPT-4, Gemini—whatever's best for the task. We're not locked into one vendor.
- **Graph database architecture:** Every NA data point is explicitly connected—biosensor NA readings to weather events to treatment adjustments to NA degradation rates.
- **Natural language querying:** An operator can ask, 'Show me all wetland sampling points where NA levels increased after heavy rain in the last three years,' and Confluent returns visualizations, trend analysis, and historical case studies.

And here's the kicker: **multi-stakeholder NA dashboards.** Indigenous communities, regulators, and operators all see the same NA data in real-time. It's auditable. It's immutable. It's independent verification of NA reduction. That's not just compliance—that's **competitive advantage.** The operators who crack the social license problem on NA transparency will unlock billions in stranded capital.

So to summarize: The biosensor provides the operational NA data operators have never had. Confluent transforms that NA data into predictive insights and verifiable transparency. Together, they're the intelligence infrastructure that makes the NA bottleneck manageable."

---

### Visual Elements:
- ACS Synthetic Biology journal publication preview (top right)
- Journal of Environmental Chemical Engineering publication preview (bottom right)
- Optional: Graph showing biosensor correlation with HRMS for NA detection (without specific R² value)

### SPEAKER NOTES (90 seconds):

"Let me address the question every investor asks: Is this technology real? Is it validated? And what's your moat?

**First: Scientific credibility.** Our biosensor technology for NA detection is peer-reviewed and published in ACS Synthetic Biology—one of the top journals in the field. This isn't a garage science experiment. It's been independently validated by experts specifically for Naphthenic Acid monitoring. We also have publications in the Journal of Environmental Chemical Engineering covering field application methodology for NA monitoring. And we have multi-layered IP protection with patents filed in Canada, the US, and under the PCT.

**Second: Field validation.** We ran a multi-season field pilot at Imperial Oil's Kearl site—one of the largest oil sands operations in the world. We tested our biosensor on 22 out of 24 unique raw OSPW samples for NA detection with minimal preparation. And we demonstrated high correlation with Orbitrap Mass Spectrometry, which is the gold-standard HRMS technology for NA characterization. We successfully tracked NA reduction in a constructed wetland from 70 milligrams per liter down to the 32-36 threshold—proving the biosensor works in real-world operational conditions for NA monitoring.

But here's what's even more important: **we proved the NA monitoring gap.** During that field study, we discovered that operators had only collected 9 NA samples over 2 field seasons. NA degradation effectiveness declined mid-season, but they didn't discover it until they analyzed the data the following year—too late to optimize. That's a multi-million dollar NA treatment system flying blind. We didn't just validate our technology—we validated the need for operational NA monitoring.

**Third: The moat.** Every time we deploy our biosensor and Confluent platform, we're building a proprietary dataset of **NA degradation kinetics** that no one else has. This data becomes the training ground for predictive models that get better with every deployment. That's a compounding intelligence moat specifically around the NA bottleneck.

And here's the competitive barrier: We're peer-reviewed for NA detection. We're field-tested for NA performance. We have regulatory relationships through our alignment with the OSMWSC recommendations on NA transparency. Any competitor trying to enter this NA monitoring space is starting years behind us.

Bottom line: **This is de-risked technology with a defensible moat specifically around the NA monitoring bottleneck.**"

---

### SPEAKER NOTES (2 minutes):

"Now let's talk about why this is an investable market from a venture perspective.

**First: Market size.** The total addressable market is $30 to $130 billion in unfunded environmental liability across Alberta's oil sands. 1.4 trillion liters of toxic water that needs to be treated and released over the next 20 to 30 years. This is a multi-decade remediation challenge affecting every major operator.

Now, to be clear: operators need to address multiple contaminants—metals, salts, suspended solids, other organics. But **Naphthenic Acids are one of the principal bottlenecks preventing regulatory approval for water release.** You can't get release approval if NA levels aren't demonstrated to be safe. That's where Luminous fits.

But here's what makes this special: **It's concentrated.** The top three operators—Canadian Natural, Suncor, and Imperial—represent over 80% of oil sands production. We're not chasing hundreds of small customers. We're targeting a handful of massive operators with deep pockets and urgent need to solve the NA bottleneck.

**Our serviceable obtainable market—the revenue we can realistically capture in the next 18-24 months—is $6 to $20 million in annual recurring revenue.** Here's how that breaks down per operator for NA monitoring:
- **Biosensor testing services:** $2 to $5 million annually for high-frequency NA screening across multiple treatment sites.
- **Confluent platform subscription:** $500K to $1 million annually in SaaS revenue for NA intelligence and transparency.
- **Integration and professional services:** $500K to $1 million for custom API integration, historical NA data structuring, and training.

At full deployment, each major operator represents **$3 to $7 million in annual recurring revenue** for our NA monitoring solution. And that's just Phase 1.

**The expansion path is clear:**
- **Phase 1:** Secure 1-2 anchor customers in the first 12 months for NA monitoring. Prove the solution at scale.
- **Phase 2:** Expand to the remaining major operators. Leverage case studies and OSMWSC regulatory alignment on NA transparency.
- **Phase 3:** Adjacent markets—mining tailings with NA challenges, industrial wastewater with NA concerns, plus potential expansion to integrate other contaminant monitoring data in Confluent.

**Why is this market so investable?**

**It's concentrated and accessible.** Small number of massive operators means efficient capital deployment. And we have direct access through CDL Rockies mentors—Steve Laut is Vice Chair of Canadian Natural. That's not a cold call. That's a warm introduction to the largest operator in the space.

**There's a regulatory forcing function.** The OSMWSC September 2025 recommendations create a 12-18 month window where operators must establish their NA intelligence infrastructure. This isn't a 'nice-to-have in 5 years.' This is 'we need this yesterday' to address the NA bottleneck.

**It's multi-decade recurring revenue.** NA treatment and water release is a 20-30 year process. NA monitoring isn't one-and-done—it's required throughout the entire lifecycle. And as production expands, NA monitoring needs expand. This is compounding, recurring revenue.

**And there are massive switching costs.** Once Confluent becomes the system of record for NA treatment history—integrated into SCADA, regulatory reporting, stakeholder dashboards for NA data—operators aren't switching. The NA data moat compounds with every sample. The longer they use it, the more valuable it becomes.

Bottom line: **This is a concentrated, accessible, multi-decade market with a regulatory forcing function around the NA bottleneck and compounding moat dynamics.** That's investable."

### SPEAKER NOTES (90 seconds):

"Let's talk about how we make money—and why this model is so attractive from an investor perspective.

**We have four revenue streams, but the first three are what matter for the next 18-24 months.**

**Revenue Stream 1: Biosensor Testing Services for NA monitoring.** This is our primary entry point. We charge $75 to $150 per NA test depending on volume and complexity. For context, HRMS costs $700 to $1,000 per sample for NA analysis. We're 5 to 10 times cheaper for NA monitoring, but operators will run 10 to 50 times more samples. So we're not competing on price—we're unlocking a new budget category for NA operational monitoring. They're not replacing HRMS spend; they're creating a new NA monitoring line item.

We structure these as monthly retainer contracts for high-frequency operational NA screening. A single major operator with multiple treatment sites could easily represent $2 to $5 million annually in biosensor NA testing alone. And gross margins are 60-70% after lab setup.

**Revenue Stream 2: Confluent Platform for NA intelligence.** This is where we transition from service revenue to recurring SaaS. The platform is priced at $500K to $1 million per operator annually, tiered based on NA data volume and user seats. Once Confluent becomes the system of record for NA treatment history—integrated into their SCADA systems, regulatory reporting, and stakeholder dashboards for NA data—they're not switching. This is 80-90% gross margin, sticky SaaS revenue with very low churn.

Now, Confluent's architecture is designed to eventually integrate data from other contaminant monitoring systems, but our current focus is the NA bottleneck that's preventing water release.

**Revenue Stream 3: Professional Services.** Integration and professional services accelerate adoption and deepen lock-in. Initial setup is $200K to $500K per operator—we're structuring historical NA data, integrating APIs, building custom NA dashboards, and training their teams. Ongoing optimization services add another $50K to $150K annually. These are 50-60% margins and they make us mission-critical to their NA management operations.

**Revenue Stream 4 is the future opportunity:** Bioaugmentation to accelerate NA degradation. This is TRL 3-4 right now, but the idea is simple: Once we've identified where NA degradation is slow using our monitoring platform, we can deploy microbial consortia to accelerate NA treatment. This is a premium add-on service that expands our TAM and leverages the NA monitoring infrastructure we've already built.

**Here's the model:** Land with biosensor NA testing. Expand to platform subscription for NA intelligence. Deepen with professional services. By Year 2, we're targeting $3 to $5.75 million in revenue with 70% gross margins and 75%+ recurring.

And here's the kicker: **The more they use it for NA management, the more valuable it becomes.** The NA data moat compounds. The switching costs increase. The customer lifetime value grows.

This is not a one-time sale. This is multi-decade, recurring, high-margin revenue with compounding lock-in around the NA bottleneck."

- Competitors starting from zero on NA monitoring = 3-5 year lag

---

### Quadrant 2 (Top Right): Proprietary Data Moat
**Icon:** Database with lock symbol

**Compounding Intelligence:**
- Every biosensor deployment generates proprietary **NA degradation data**
- Building unparalleled structured dataset linking:
  - NA concentrations to treatment methods
  - Environmental conditions to NA degradation rates
  - Historical trends to predictive NA outcomes

**First-Mover Advantage:**
- NA data moat compounds with each customer deployment
- Predictive models for NA treatment improve faster than competitors can catch up
- Operators stay for the NA insights, not just the monitoring

**Network Effects:**
- More NA data = better predictions = higher value = more customers = more NA data
- Creates virtuous cycle that accelerates defensibility around NA intelligence

---

### Quadrant 3 (Bottom Left): Social License as Competitive Advantage
**Icon:** Handshake with Indigenous symbol

**Multi-Stakeholder NA Transparency:**
- Confluent provides independent, auditable verification of NA levels
- Real-time dashboards for Indigenous communities and regulators showing NA data
- Immutable records of NA reduction = trust-building infrastructure

**Indigenous Engagement:**
- Active discussions with Mikisew Cree First Nation on NA transparency
- Early engagement = co-development of transparency protocols for NA monitoring
- Operators who solve social license on NA transparency unlock stranded capital

**Regulatory Alignment:**
- OSMWSC Sept 2025 recommendations explicitly require stakeholder transparency for NA levels
- Luminous built for this NA transparency requirement from Day 1
- Competitors retrofitting NA compliance = friction and delay

**Why This Matters:**
"Trust is the bottleneck, not technology. Operators who crack social license on NA transparency will unlock billions in expansion capital."

---

### Quadrant 4 (Bottom Right): Regulatory & Market Timing
**Icon:** Clock with checkmark

**Regulatory Forcing Function:**
- OSMWSC mandate creates 12-18 month window for NA infrastructure buildout
- Operators cannot wait for "better" NA solutions—they need compliant systems now
- Luminous is the only validated solution aligned with Sept 2025 requirements for NA monitoring

**Market Timing:**
- Production doubling over next decade = expanding NA monitoring needs
- Physical constraints (tailings capacity) forcing urgent action on NA reduction
- Economic pressure (stranded assets) + political pressure (public scrutiny) converging on NA issue

**Established Relationships:**
- CDL Rockies mentors provide direct access (Steve Laut - CNRL Vice Chair)
- Existing field validation for NA monitoring at Imperial Kearl = credibility with operators
- Pathways Alliance engagement = access to entire operator consortium

---

### Bottom Callout Box (spans all quadrants):

**"IP protects the NA technology. Data moat compounds the NA advantage. Social license unlocks the market. Regulatory timing accelerates adoption."**

### SPEAKER NOTES (2 minutes):

"Let me walk you through why Luminous wins on the NA monitoring challenge—and why this is defensible.

**First: Intellectual Property for NA detection.** We have patents filed in Canada, the US, and under the PCT specifically for our NA biosensor technology. Our biosensor design for NA detection, methods, and platform architecture are protected. We've established freedom to operate—no blocking patents. And critically, we're peer-reviewed and published in ACS Synthetic Biology specifically for NA monitoring. That academic credibility is a massive barrier to entry. Operators in this space are risk-averse. They trust peer-reviewed science. Competitors can't just show up with a garage prototype for NA detection and win. They're starting 3 to 5 years behind us on NA monitoring.

**Second: Proprietary NA Data Moat.** This is where it gets really interesting. Every time we deploy our biosensor and Confluent platform, we're generating proprietary **NA degradation data** that no one else has. We're building a structured dataset linking NA concentrations to treatment methods, environmental conditions to NA degradation rates, historical trends to predictive NA outcomes. This data becomes the training ground for predictive models on NA treatment that improve with every deployment. The more customers we have, the better our NA predictions get. The better our NA predictions, the more valuable we become. That's a compounding moat with network effects specifically around NA intelligence. Competitors can't catch up because they don't have the NA data.

**Third: Social License as Competitive Advantage on NA transparency.** This is the insight most people miss. **Trust is the bottleneck, not technology.** Indigenous communities don't trust operators to honestly report NA levels. Regulators don't trust self-reported NA data. The public is skeptical after decades of spills where operators couldn't independently verify NA contamination. Luminous solves this with multi-stakeholder NA transparency. Confluent provides independent, auditable verification of NA levels with real-time dashboards for Indigenous communities, regulators, and operators. Immutable records of NA reduction. Independent verification. This isn't just compliance—this is social license infrastructure around NA transparency. And here's the key: Operators who crack the social license problem on NA transparency will unlock billions in stranded capital. We're in active discussions with Mikisew Cree First Nation on NA monitoring protocols. We're co-developing transparency frameworks for NA data. Competitors retrofitting NA compliance into their systems will be years behind.

And the OSMWSC September 2025 recommendations explicitly require stakeholder transparency for NA levels. We didn't bolt this on—we designed for NA transparency from Day 1.

**Fourth: Regulatory and Market Timing on the NA bottleneck.** The OSMWSC mandate creates a 12-18 month window where operators must establish their NA intelligence infrastructure. They can't wait for a "better solution" in 3 years. They need a compliant, validated system for NA monitoring now. And Luminous is the only solution that's peer-reviewed, field-tested, and aligned with the September 2025 requirements for NA transparency.

We also have established relationships. CDL Rockies mentors give us direct access—Steve Laut is Vice Chair of Canadian Natural. We have field validation credibility for NA monitoring from Imperial Kearl. And we're in active discussions with Pathways Alliance, which represents all the major operators.

Bottom line: **IP protects the NA technology. The NA data moat compounds the advantage. Social license on NA transparency unlocks the market. And regulatory timing accelerates adoption.** Those four advantages working together create a defensible, venture-scale opportunity around the NA bottleneck."

## SLIDE 10: Competitive Positioning

**Title:** Complementary, Not Competitive: Luminous Fills the Operational NA Monitoring Gap

**Layout:** Left side has positioning framework text, right side has revised 2x2 matrix

### Left Side - Positioning Framework:

**The Key Insight:**
"Luminous does not replace HRMS for NA characterization. We enable operators to use HRMS more strategically by providing high-frequency operational NA screening that identifies when and where to deploy expensive gold-standard NA testing."

**Why This Matters to Operators:**
- HRMS remains the regulatory backstop for NA compliance (Tier 1)
- Luminous biosensor provides operational NA process control (Tier 2)
- Confluent unifies both into actionable NA intelligence (Tier 3)

**Result:** Operators reduce total NA monitoring cost while increasing NA data quality and frequency

---

**The Complementary Value Proposition:**

**Before Luminous:**
- Operators collect 10-20 HRMS NA samples per year per site
- Cost: $700-$1,000 per NA sample
- Annual NA monitoring spend: $7K-$20K per site
- Result: Blind to operational NA trends, NA treatment optimization impossible

**With Luminous:**
- Operators run 100-500 biosensor NA tests per year per site (operational screening)
- Operators run 10-20 HRMS NA samples per year (validation + compliance)
- Biosensor cost: <$100 per NA test
- Total NA monitoring spend: $10K-$50K per site for biosensor + $7K-$20K for HRMS = $17K-$70K
- Result: 10-50x more NA data, targeted HRMS deployment, optimized NA treatment, regulatory compliance maintained

**Value Delivered:**
- 10-50x increase in NA monitoring frequency
- $2-$5M in avoided treatment costs (optimized NA process control)
- Maintained regulatory compliance (HRMS still used for NA validation)
- Multi-stakeholder transparency (Confluent provides auditable NA records)

- Subtitle: "Unifies all NA monitoring data into actionable insights"

---

### Bottom Callout Box:

**"Operators need both HRMS accuracy for NA compliance AND operational frequency for NA treatment control. Luminous provides the missing operational NA layer while making HRMS more strategic."**

### SPEAKER NOTES (90 seconds):

"I want to be crystal clear about our competitive positioning because this is critical: **Luminous does not replace HRMS for NA monitoring. We complement it.**

Let me explain why this matters.

HRMS—High-Resolution Mass Spectrometry—is the gold standard for NA characterization and regulatory compliance. It's molecular-level accuracy for NA analysis. Regulators require it. It's not going anywhere. But it costs $700 to $1,000 per sample for NA analysis and takes 6-8 weeks. That makes it perfect for validation and compliance reporting of NA levels, but useless for operational decision-making on NA treatment.

**Luminous fills the operational NA gap.** Our biosensor provides high-frequency NA screening at a fraction of the cost. Operators can run 10 to 50 times more NA tests than they do today with HRMS, which gives them the operational visibility they need to optimize NA treatment systems in real-time.

But here's the key: **We make HRMS more strategic for NA management.** Instead of operators blindly collecting HRMS NA samples every quarter and hoping they captured the right moment, they use our biosensor for continuous operational NA screening. When the biosensor identifies an interesting NA trend—NA levels spiking, NA degradation effectiveness declining—they deploy targeted HRMS testing to validate and report to regulators.

**Before Luminous:** Operators collect 10-20 HRMS NA samples per year per site. Annual spend on NA monitoring is $7K to $20K. They're blind to operational NA trends. NA treatment optimization is impossible.

**With Luminous:** Operators run 100-500 biosensor NA tests per year for operational screening, plus 10-20 HRMS NA samples for validation and compliance. Total NA monitoring spend increases to $17K to $70K per site, but they get 10 to 50 times more NA data, optimized NA treatment, and maintained regulatory compliance. And critically, they avoid $2 to $5 million in treatment costs by catching NA degradation inefficiencies early.

Look at the positioning matrix on the right. HRMS is Tier 1—high regulatory acceptance for NA compliance, low frequency. Luminous biosensor is Tier 2—operational NA screening, high frequency. And Confluent is the connecting layer—Tier 3—that unifies all the NA data into actionable insights and stakeholder transparency.

**We're not in competition with HRMS for NA monitoring. We're in collaboration with it.** And that's what makes this so defensible. We're selling into an existing budget for NA management, not trying to displace an entrenched solution. Operators need both for the NA bottleneck. We provide the missing piece."

### SPEAKER NOTES (2 minutes):

"Let me close with the roadmap and the ask.

**We're raising $1.5 million in a seed round** to execute an 18-month roadmap that gets us to Series A-ready with $3-5 million in annual recurring revenue and a clear path to $20 million ARR by solving the NA bottleneck.

Here's the roadmap:

**Phase 1—Foundation, Months 0-6:** Close the seed round. Secure two anchor operator pilots for NA monitoring with committed, paid deployments. Establish field lab infrastructure for high-throughput biosensor NA testing. Deploy the Confluent platform MVP with initial SCADA integrations for NA data. By Month 6, we have paying customers and operational NA monitoring deployments. This is proof that operators will pay to solve the NA bottleneck.

**Phase 2—Validation, Months 7-12:** Convert those pilots into multi-year NA monitoring contracts. Achieve TRL 7+ with successful multi-site deployments for NA screening. Publish additional peer-reviewed validation data on NA biosensor performance to reinforce scientific credibility. Expand Confluent platform to include multi-stakeholder dashboards for NA transparency with Indigenous communities and regulators. By Month 12, we have $1 million-plus in annual recurring revenue and validated NA technology at scale. This is proof that the business model works for the NA solution.

**Phase 3—Scale, Months 13-18:** Expand to a third major operator. Multi-site NA monitoring deployments across multiple operators. Formalize Indigenous partnership on NA transparency—Mikisew Cree or equivalent. Prepare the Series A fundraise of $5-8 million for market expansion. By Month 18, we have $3-5 million in ARR, 75%+ recurring revenue, and a clear expansion pipeline. This is proof that we're ready to scale.

**Here's how we're deploying the $1.5 million:**

- **40%—$600,000—goes to commercial scaling:** Sales, business development, pilot execution for NA monitoring, customer success. This is how we land and expand with anchor operators on the NA challenge.

- **30%—$450,000—goes to market development:** Regulatory and Indigenous engagement on NA transparency, OSMWSC alignment, marketing, thought leadership on NA solution, CDL Rockies participation. This is how we build credibility and access around the NA bottleneck.

- **20%—$300,000—goes to technology optimization:** Biosensor lab scaling for NA testing, Confluent platform development for NA intelligence, API integrations for NA data. This is how we deliver on our technical promises for NA management.

- **10%—$150,000—goes to operations and working capital:** Core team salaries, legal, IP, compliance.

**Key milestones you should track:**
- **Month 0:** Close $1.5 million seed round.
- **Month 6:** Two anchor pilots for NA monitoring launched.
- **Month 12:** $1 million-plus ARR, TRL 7 validation for NA technology.
- **Month 18:** $3-5 million ARR, Series A ready.

**Why invest now?**

This is a **concentrated market with a regulatory forcing function around the NA bottleneck.** Operators have a 12-18 month window to establish their NA intelligence infrastructure. We're peer-reviewed for NA detection, field-tested for NA performance, and aligned with the OSMWSC September 2025 requirements on NA transparency. We have direct access through CDL Rockies mentors. We have a compounding NA data moat. And we have a land-and-expand model that turns one customer into multi-million dollar ARR.

This is not a science project. This is a **de-risked, defensible, venture-scale opportunity with clear milestones and a path to $20 million ARR by solving the NA bottleneck.**

**Next steps:** I have a due diligence package ready—technical validation data on NA biosensor, financial model, IP documentation. If you want, we can arrange a site visit to Imperial Kearl where we ran our field validation for NA monitoring. I can also make introductions to our CDL Rockies mentors and operator contacts.

We're targeting to close this round in Q1 2026. The structure is flexible—SAFE or priced equity.

**Let's talk about how you can be part of solving one of the principal bottlenecks in Canada's largest industrial environmental challenge—the NA problem—and building a multi-decade, recurring revenue business in the process.**

Thank you."

## Q&A Preparation (Anticipated Investor Questions):

### Technical Questions:

**Q: How do you ensure biosensor accuracy for NA detection in variable field conditions?**
A: Our multi-season field validation at Imperial Kearl tested 22/24 unique OSPW samples for NA detection with minimal preparation. We demonstrated high correlation with gold-standard Orbitrap Mass Spectrometry for NA characterization across varying NA concentrations (2-70 mg/L). The biosensor panel uses multiple engineered strains targeting different NA classes, which provides redundancy and increases reliability for NA monitoring. We validate against HRMS periodically to ensure NA accuracy is maintained.

**Q: What about other contaminants like metals, salts, and suspended solids? Don't operators need to monitor those too?**
A: Absolutely correct. Operators must monitor multiple contaminants—metals like arsenic and selenium, salts, suspended solids, other organics. Our biosensor specifically targets Naphthenic Acids because **NAs are one of the principal contaminants of concern preventing regulatory approval for water release.** You can't get release approval if NA levels aren't demonstrated to be safe, regardless of other contaminants. We're solving the NA bottleneck first. Confluent's architecture is designed to eventually integrate monitoring data from other contaminant systems, but our current focus—and our defensible moat—is the NA intelligence layer that doesn't exist today.

**Q: What happens when operators need regulatory-grade NA data? Doesn't that make your biosensor irrelevant?**
A: Operators will always need HRMS for regulatory compliance on NA characterization—and we're not replacing it. We're complementary. Our biosensor enables 10-50x more operational NA screening, which helps operators identify when and where to deploy expensive HRMS testing strategically for NA validation. Instead of blind quarterly NA sampling, they use our biosensor for continuous NA monitoring and deploy HRMS for targeted validation and regulatory reporting of NA levels.

**Q: Is the AI in Confluent actually operational, or is this vaporware?**
A: The backend architecture is operational—graph database (TerminusDB), PostgreSQL for structured data, vector database (Qdrant) for semantic search. We're ingesting and structuring NA data today. The AI-native design means we're built to leverage multiple LLMs (Claude, GPT-4, Gemini) with model-agnostic orchestration. Natural language querying and advanced predictive analytics for NA intelligence are in development for frontend deployment in Q4 2025. We're not selling vaporware—we're selling the infrastructure that makes AI valuable for NA management.

### Business Model Questions:

**Q: Why wouldn't operators just build NA monitoring in-house?**
A: Three reasons: (1) **IP protection**—our NA biosensor technology is patented and peer-reviewed. They can't replicate it without licensing. (2) **Data moat**—we're building a proprietary dataset of NA degradation kinetics they can't access. (3) **Opportunity cost**—operators are focused on extraction and production, not building biotech R&D labs for NA detection and AI platforms for NA intelligence. They want turnkey NA solutions, not science projects.

**Q: What's your customer acquisition cost, and how long is the sales cycle?**
A: Oil sands sales cycles are typically 12-18 months for new technology adoption. However, the OSMWSC regulatory mandate on NA transparency compresses this to 6-12 months because operators must act urgently on the NA bottleneck. Our CAC is low relative to enterprise SaaS because: (1) Concentrated market—only 3-5 major operators. (2) CDL Rockies mentors provide warm introductions. (3) Regulatory forcing function on NA transparency reduces friction. We estimate CAC of $150K-$300K per anchor customer (pilot programs, validation, integration) with LTV of $10M-$20M over 10 years ($3-7M annually for NA monitoring solution x multi-decade contracts).

**Q: How do you prevent commoditization? What if competitors undercut on price for NA testing?**
A: The NA data moat prevents commoditization. Confluent becomes the system of record for NA treatment history. The longer operators use it, the more valuable it becomes—historical NA trends, predictive models for NA degradation, regulatory audit trails for NA compliance. Switching costs are massive. Even if a competitor offered cheaper biosensor NA testing, they can't replicate the NA intelligence layer and historical NA data we've built. That's the moat.

### Market Questions:

**Q: What if the regulatory mandate gets delayed or watered down?**
A: Even without regulatory pressure on NA transparency, operators face physical and economic constraints. Tailings ponds are at capacity. Production is doubling. They need to demonstrate NA reduction and release treated water or face stranded assets. The regulatory mandate accelerates urgency on NA transparency, but the operational need to solve the NA bottleneck exists regardless. Additionally, social license pressure from Indigenous communities on NA verification is intensifying independent of government timelines.

**Q: Why hasn't NA monitoring been solved already? If it's such a big problem, why are you the first?**
A: Because oil sands operators have never had release approval. For 50 years, the answer was "contain it, don't release it." There was no economic incentive to invest in high-frequency NA monitoring. The regulatory shift to "treat and release" only happened in 2024-2025, which created the urgent need for NA intelligence. We're not early—we're exactly on time. The market for NA monitoring is just being created now.

**Q: Can this expand beyond oil sands and beyond NAs?**
A: Absolutely. **Phase 1 is oil sands NA monitoring** (concentrated market, high urgency, regulatory forcing function). Phase 2 expands in two directions: (1) Adjacent industries with NA challenges—coal mining tailings (Teck Resources), pulp and paper wastewater, chemical processing with NA contamination. (2) Expand Confluent to integrate other contaminant monitoring data for oil sands operators as they build comprehensive water treatment programs. The biosensor panel technology can potentially be adapted to detect other contaminant classes in future. But our beachhead—and our defensible moat—is NA intelligence.

### Team & Execution Questions:

**Q: Do you have the team to scale this operationally? Running a lab and deploying field services for NA testing is hard.**
A: Yes. Jeff (COO) has 30 years commercializing technology and understands operational scaling. Dr. Lewenza (CSO) has run research labs for decades and knows biosensor production for NA detection specifically—he's been researching NAs for 10+ years. We're raising $1.5M specifically to build field lab infrastructure for high-throughput NA testing and hire lab technicians. We're not trying to scale to 100 operators in Year 1—we're targeting 2 anchor customers for NA monitoring in Year 1, which is operationally manageable.

**Q: What's your unfair advantage in getting the first customer for NA monitoring?**
A: Three things: (1) **Field validation credibility**—we already ran a multi-season pilot for NA monitoring at Imperial Kearl. We're not cold-calling with a science experiment. (2) **CDL Rockies mentor access**—Steve Laut (Vice Chair of Canadian Natural) is one of our mentors. That's a warm introduction to the largest operator in the space. (3) **Indigenous engagement on NA transparency**—we're in active discussions with Mikisew Cree First Nation specifically about NA transparency and multi-stakeholder verification. Operators who solve social license on NA transparency unlock billions in stranded capital. We're positioning as the NA transparency infrastructure that rebuilds trust.
