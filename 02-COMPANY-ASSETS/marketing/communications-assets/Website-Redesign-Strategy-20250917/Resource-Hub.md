## Technical Notes

**Gating Strategy:**
- Email only (low friction)
- Same email auto-populates for subsequent downloads
- Track download patterns (which resources by which personas?)

**Lead Scoring:**
- Executive Brief download = warm lead
- White Paper download = technical evaluation
- Multiple downloads = hot lead (trigger sales follow-up)

**SEO Meta:**
"Technical resources for NA monitoring: Executive brief, white paper, peer-reviewed publications, OSMWSC compliance framework. Download validation data."
