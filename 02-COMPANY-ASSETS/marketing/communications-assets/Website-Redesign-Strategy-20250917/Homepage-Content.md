## The Story (Three Short Sections)
### The Challenge

**12-18 months.** That's the timeline Alberta's OSMWSC set for water release guidelines—meaning operators must prepare to transition from 60 years of containment to regulated release of 1.4 trillion litres of OSPW.

**The bottleneck: Naphthenic Acids.** No safe NA levels = no release approval. But HRMS can't scale (6-8 weeks, $700-$1,000/sample). Quarterly snapshots can't optimize dynamic biological treatment.

**The question:** *"Is treatment working right now, and what should we adjust?"*

### The Solution
**Luminous provides operational intelligence between HRMS compliance checkpoints:**
- **Biosensor:** 24-hour NA screening, high correlation (R > 0.9) with HRMS
- **Confluent AI:** Transforms data into insights—natural language queries, multi-stakeholder dashboards, predictive analytics

We don't replace HRMS. We enable daily monitoring within existing budgets while HRMS validates quarterly.


### Why This Matters
**For Operators:** Detect treatment failures in days (not months), optimize based on data (not guesswork)
**For Regulators:** Multi-stakeholder transparency addressing OSMWSC requirements
**For Scientists:** Peer-reviewed validation (*ACS Synthetic Biology*, 2024), field-tested at Kearl wetland
**For Indigenous Communities:** Real-time monitoring access with plain language presentation—built for transparency, refined through engagement

## Validation

**Peer-Reviewed Science:** *ACS Synthetic Biology* (2024)
**Field-Tested:** Multi-season Kearl wetland validation (36% NA reduction, biosensor vs. Orbitrap MS)
**Industry Engagement:** CNRL, Suncor, Imperial, Pathways Alliance
**Regulatory Alignment:** OSMWSC compliance frameworks ready

*"Operational technology solving real problems today, not theoretical concepts."*
