### Headline
**"Operational Intelligence for the NA Bottleneck"**

### Subheadline
**"24-hour biosensor screening + AI-native platform = data-driven treatment optimization and stakeholder transparency"**

### Hero Visual (Does Heavy Lifting)
**Three-Tier Strategy Diagram:**
- **Tier 1:** HRMS (Compliance - Quarterly - 6-8 weeks)
- **Tier 2:** Luminous Biosensor (Screening - Daily - 24 hours)
- **Tier 3:** Confluent AI (Intelligence - Real-time insights)

## The Challenge (One Paragraph)

Oil sands operators are transitioning from 60 years of containment to regulated release—1.4 trillion litres of OSPW requiring treatment, with release standards expected in 12-18 months. **The bottleneck: Naphthenic Acids.** You can't get release approval if NA levels aren't demonstrated safe, but HRMS alone can't scale (6-8 weeks, $700-$1,000/sample = quarterly snapshots of dynamic biological processes). **The question operators need to answer:** *"Is treatment working right now, and what should we adjust?"*

## The Luminous Approach (Visual + Minimal Text)

### Three-Tier Strategy Cards

**TIER 1: HRMS**
Gold standard for compliance
We acknowledge it. We don't replace it.

**TIER 2: Biosensor**
24-hour NA results, daily monitoring
Peer-reviewed (*ACS Synthetic Biology*, 2024)
High correlation (R > 0.9) with HRMS on real OSPW

**TIER 3: Confluent AI**
Natural language querying of years of data
Multi-stakeholder dashboards (Operator/Regulator/Community)
Gets smarter with every dataset added

### Value Statement (One Sentence)
**Biosensor alone = more data. Confluent alone = no operational frequency. Together = integrated intelligence.**

## Why This Matters (Three Value Cards - Expandable/Collapsible)

**1. Detect Failures in Days, Not Months**
Kearl wetland study: 9 samples over 2 seasons, degradation slowdown discovered too late. With daily biosensor data, you catch problems while you can still fix them.

**2. Optimize Based on Data, Not Guesswork**
High-frequency monitoring enables A/B testing, correlation analysis, predictive modeling—treatment decisions backed by statistical significance.

**3. Build Trust Through Transparency**
Oil sands operations have impacted Indigenous lands and waters for decades. As operators move toward water release, affected communities have every right to verify that treatment is actually working—not just accept promises. Confluent's multi-view dashboards were designed to provide real-time access to monitoring data, presented in plain language. But technology alone doesn't build trust. **We're seeking to engage with affected Indigenous communities to understand what transparency tools would actually serve their needs.**

## Validation (Logos + One-Liners)

**Peer-Reviewed:** *ACS Synthetic Biology* (2024)
**Field-Tested:** Kearl multi-season wetland validation
**Industry-Engaged:** CNRL, Suncor, Imperial conversations
**Regulatory-Aligned:** OSMWSC compliance frameworks ready

*"This is operational technology solving real problems today, not theoretical concepts."*
