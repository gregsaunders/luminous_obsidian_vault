# Website Redesign Strategy & Content Map

**Date:** October 23, 2025 (Updated)

**Objective:** Simplified website structure focused on validation and engagement. Tell one compelling story, eliminate redundancy, drive visitors to conversation.

---

## 1. Core Strategic Shift: Validation Over Complexity

**Guiding principle:** Luminous is not a complex business. We solve one problem (NA monitoring bottleneck) for four audiences (Operators, Regulators, Scientists, Indigenous Communities). The website should validate we're credible and drive engagement—not overwhelm with repetitive messaging.

**Key insight:** Repeating the Three-Tier strategy, Kearl validation, and OSMWSC alignment across multiple pages dilutes the message. Tell the story once, show the value by audience, provide resources for depth.

---

## 2. New Simplified Sitemap

**Site Structure (4 Pages):**

1. **Homepage** - Tell the complete story once
2. **Solutions** - Show what we deliver to each audience
3. **Resources** - Provide downloadable depth
4. **About** - Team, mission, validation

**Navigation Philosophy:**
- Homepage establishes credibility and problem/solution
- Solutions explains value by audience (no repetition of technical explanation)
- Resources provides gated content for lead generation
- About builds trust through team and validation credentials

---

## 3. Page-by-Page Strategy

### Homepage (luminousbiosolutions.com)
**Word Count:** ~400 words max
**Strategy:** Validate credibility → Show the problem → Offer engagement

**Core Message:**
- The Challenge: HRMS can't scale (6-8 weeks, $700-$1,000/sample)
- The Solution: 24-hour biosensor + Confluent AI = operational intelligence
- Validation: Peer-reviewed (*ACS Synthetic Biology*), field-tested (Kearl), industry-engaged
- Primary CTA: Schedule Technical Briefing

**Key Elements:**
- Simple 3-Tier diagram (HRMS → Biosensor → Confluent AI)
- One paragraph per section (Challenge/Solution/Why This Matters)
- Validation badges (peer-reviewed, field-tested, OSMWSC-aligned)
- Dual CTAs: Schedule Briefing (primary), Download Resources (secondary)

---

### Solutions (luminousbiosolutions.com/solutions)
**Word Count:** ~500 words max
**Strategy:** Explain what we deliver → Show value by audience → Drive to engagement

**Structure:**
1. **What We Offer** (two-part solution explained once)
   - Tier 2: Biosensor (24-hour screening, R > 0.9 HRMS correlation)
   - Tier 3: Confluent AI (multi-stakeholder dashboards, natural language queries)

2. **Value by Audience** (focused on outcomes, NOT re-explaining the tech)
   - For Operators: Early detection, data-driven optimization, avoided costs
   - For Regulators: OSMWSC compliance, multi-stakeholder transparency, audit trail
   - For Scientists: Peer-reviewed validation, honest limitations, AI-native architecture
   - For Indigenous Communities: Real-time monitoring access, plain language presentation

3. **Implementation** (pilot program overview)

**Key Principle:** No repetition. Technical explanation lives in "What We Offer" section. Audience sections focus purely on value and outcomes.

---

### Resources (luminousbiosolutions.com/resources)
**Word Count:** ~150 words (resource cards only)
**Strategy:** Simple list → Low-friction gating → Track engagement

**Available Resources:**
- Executive Brief (business case, 5 pages)
- Kearl Case Study (field validation results)
- White Paper (technical deep-dive, 10 pages)
- OSMWSC Compliance Framework
- Peer-Reviewed Publications (no gate)

**Gating:** Email only (auto-populate for subsequent downloads)
**Lead Scoring:** Track which resources downloaded by which visitors
**Primary CTA:** Schedule Technical Briefing

---

### About (luminousbiosolutions.com/about)
**Word Count:** ~300 words max
**Strategy:** Mission → Team → Validation → Engage

**Core Sections:**
- Our Mission (enabling containment → release transition)
- What We Do (monitoring + intelligence company, focused on NA)
- The Team (CSO, CTO, COO credentials + partnerships)
- Our Foundation (peer-reviewed, field-validated, regulatory-aligned)
- Commitment to Respectful Engagement (Indigenous community consultation)

**Tone:** Humble confidence. Clear about scope and limitations. Mission-focused.

---

## 4. Eliminated Pages

**Deleted (redundant):**
- Solutions-Operators.md
- Solutions-Scientists.md
- Solutions-Regulators.md

**Reason:** Separate persona pages created 70% message repetition. Three-Tier strategy explained 4 times, Kearl study repeated 3 times, OSMWSC messaging duplicated across pages. Unified Solutions page eliminates redundancy while maintaining audience-specific value propositions.

---

## 5. Key Content Principles

**Tell Once, Reference After:**
- Three-Tier strategy explained on Homepage hero
- Kearl validation mentioned on Homepage, detailed in Resources download
- OSMWSC alignment mentioned on Homepage, detailed in Resources download
- Biosensor specs (R > 0.9, 24-hour) stated once on Homepage

**Audience Value, Not Tech Re-explanation:**
- Solutions page focuses on outcomes for each audience
- Assumes visitor already understands the technology from Homepage
- Shows "what this means for you" not "here's how it works again"

**Engagement Over Information:**
- Primary goal: Schedule Technical Briefing
- Secondary goal: Download Resources (lead capture)
- Website validates credibility, conversation converts

---

## 6. Conversion Strategy

**Primary Conversion Path:**
Homepage → Schedule Technical Briefing

**Secondary Conversion Path:**
Homepage → Solutions (understand value) → Resources (download) → Schedule Briefing

**Lead Scoring:**
- Briefing request = hot lead (immediate follow-up)
- Resource download = warm lead (nurture sequence)
- Multiple resource downloads = very hot lead (immediate reach-out)

---

## 7. Visual Priorities

**Homepage:**
- Simple 3-Tier diagram (HRMS → Biosensor → Confluent AI)
- Validation badges (peer-reviewed, field-tested, industry logos)

**Solutions:**
- Dashboard mockup (multi-view demonstration)
- Kearl time-series graph (sparse HRMS vs. dense biosensor data)

**All Pages:**
- Clean, professional design
- Minimal text, maximum clarity
- Every visual should reduce the need for explanatory text

---

## 8. SEO & Technical Notes

**Homepage Meta:** "24-hour NA biosensor + AI platform for oil sands water treatment. Peer-reviewed, field-tested. Complements HRMS with operational monitoring."

**Solutions Meta:** "Luminous biosensor + Confluent AI solutions for oil sands operators, regulators, scientists, Indigenous communities. NA monitoring with multi-stakeholder transparency."
