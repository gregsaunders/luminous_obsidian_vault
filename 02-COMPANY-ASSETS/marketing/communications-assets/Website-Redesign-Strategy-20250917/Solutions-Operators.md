## Hero Section

### Headline
**"Catch Treatment Failures in Days, Not Months"**

### Subheadline
**"Daily biosensor screening gives you operational intelligence between HRMS compliance checkpoints"**

### Hero Visual
**Kearl Time-Series Graph:**
- Sparse HRMS points (quarterly) vs. Dense biosensor data (daily)
- Annotation: "Mid-season degradation visible here ↓" (pointing to biosensor data)
- Annotation: "...but invisible here" (pointing to HRMS gap)

## The Problem (One Paragraph + Visual)

You're managing multi-million dollar treatment programs with quarterly HRMS snapshots. **Kearl wetland example:** 9 NA samples over 2 field seasons. When degradation rates declined mid-season, this wasn't discovered until the following year—too late to optimize. **The constraint isn't HRMS quality, it's HRMS scalability.** 6-8 weeks and $700-$1,000/sample means you choose: comprehensive spatial coverage OR frequent monitoring. Budget won't allow both.

## The Luminous Solution (Three Cards - Visual Heavy)

### TIER 1: HRMS - Strategic Validation
Gold standard for compliance. We don't replace it—we enable strategic deployment (quarterly validation) while biosensor handles operational frequency.

### TIER 2: Biosensor - Daily Screening
- 24-hour turnaround
- High correlation (R > 0.9) with HRMS on real OSPW
- Service-based pricing (test daily without per-sample charges)
- 10-50x monitoring increase within budget

### TIER 3: Confluent AI - Intelligence
- Natural language queries: *"What worked when NA levels spiked last year?"*
- Automatic linking of today's biosensor data to 5 years of historical context
- Multi-stakeholder dashboards (Operator/Regulator/Community views)

### Value Statement
**Result: Comprehensive spatial + temporal coverage within existing budgets**

## Why This Matters (Three Bullets - Expandable)

**1. Early Detection = Avoided Costs**
Treatment failure begins May. Biosensor detects it in 72 hours. HRMS would detect it in September—4 months too late. **Value: $2-5M avoided, timeline maintained.**

**2. Data-Driven Optimization**
High-frequency datasets enable A/B testing of treatment approaches with statistical significance. Stop guessing, start validating.

**3. Stakeholder Transparency**
OSMWSC 2025 requires technology transparency with Indigenous communities. Confluent's dashboards address this—operators, regulators, communities see same trusted data, appropriate presentation.

## Technical Notes

**SEO Meta:**
"Daily NA biosensor screening + AI intelligence = operational treatment optimization for oil sands operators. Detect failures in days, not months."

**Conversion Goal:**
Technical briefing request (highest intent for operators)

**Visual Priority:**
Kearl time-series graph does the heavy lifting—shows problem and solution in one image.
