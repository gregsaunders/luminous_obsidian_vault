## Hero Section

### Headline
**"Multi-Stakeholder Transparency Built Into the Platform"**

### Subheadline
**"One system, three dashboard views: Operators, regulators, and Indigenous communities see the same trusted data—presented appropriately for each audience"**

### Hero Visual
**Dashboard Mockup (Split-Screen):**
- Left: Operator dashboard (real-time biosensor results, treatment recommendations)
- Right: Community dashboard (color-coded maps, plain language, safety context)
- Center annotation: "Same data, appropriate presentation"

## The OSMWSC Mandate (One Paragraph + Quote)

**OSMWSC September 2025 recommendation:**
*"Operators should strive to share relevant information about technologies they are piloting with Indigenous communities, public and stakeholders to ensure awareness and build trust."*

**The challenge:** Indigenous communities are justifiably skeptical. Quarterly reports feel like "trust us," not "see for yourself." Maintaining separate reporting systems for different audiences creates version control issues and delays transparency.

## The Luminous Solution (Visual-First)

### Confluent Multi-View Dashboards

**One Platform, Three Views:**

**Regulator Dashboard:**
- Compliance metrics vs. thresholds
- Trend analysis and statistical summaries
- Immutable audit trail (no retroactive changes)
- Automated AER-compliant exports

**Operator Dashboard:**
- Real-time biosensor results + HRMS validation status
- Treatment optimization recommendations
- Predictive forecasting, operational alerts

**Community/Indigenous Dashboard:**
- Color-coded maps (green = safe, yellow = monitoring)
- Plain language (not technical jargon)
- NA levels relative to safety thresholds
- Real-time updates (last updated: 2 hours ago)

### The Technical Foundation
- **Biosensor:** 24-hour NA results (peer-reviewed, field-validated)
- **HRMS:** Quarterly validation (gold standard correlation)
- **Confluent AI:** Unified data platform (biosensor + HRMS + historical PDFs + SCADA)

## Why This Matters (Three Bullets)

**1. Addresses OSMWSC Transparency Requirements**
Built-in multi-stakeholder engagement. Operators demonstrate good-faith transparency through real-time data access, not delayed reports.

**2. Auditable Data Integrity**
Immutable audit trail. No retroactive changes. Automated compliance reporting. Regulatory scrutiny-ready before submission required.

**3. Builds Stakeholder Confidence**
Communities verify treatment progress independently. Regulators access comprehensive datasets. Operators differentiate through transparency leadership.
