# Website Continuous Improvement Workflow

**Created:** October 23, 2025
**Purpose:** Systematic process for keeping website aligned with evolving business strategy, regulatory changes, and market developments

---

## Core Principle

**The website should ALWAYS reflect:**
1. Current business strategy (Master Context file = source of truth)
2. Latest regulatory developments (OSMWSC, AER, release standards)
3. Most recent validation data (peer-reviewed publications, field studies)
4. Accurate service offerings (no bioaugmentation until launched, for example)

**When these change, the website MUST update.**

---

## Update Triggers (When to Review Website)

### 1. Strategic Pivots
**Examples:**
- Business model changes (monitoring-only → monitoring + bioaugmentation)
- Target market shifts (oil sands only → industrial water treatment)
- Pricing model updates (service fees, pilot program structure)
- Partnership announcements (major industry collaborations)

**Trigger:** Master Context update indicating strategic change
**Review Scope:** Full website audit (all pages potentially affected)
**Timeline:** Within 1 week of strategic decision

---

### 2. Regulatory Announcements
**Examples:**
- New OSMWSC recommendations
- Release standards finalized by Alberta government
- AER compliance requirement changes
- Indigenous consultation policy updates

**Trigger:** Regulatory document released or policy announced
**Review Scope:** Homepage (urgency framing), Regulators page, Resource Hub (add compliance framework updates)
**Timeline:** Within 2 weeks of announcement

---

### 3. Scientific Validation Milestones
**Examples:**
- New peer-reviewed papers published
- Field validation studies completed
- Correlation data officially released (specific R values)
- Independent third-party testing results

**Trigger:** Publication accepted or study results finalized
**Review Scope:** Homepage (validation section), Scientists page, Resource Hub (add new publications)
**Timeline:** Within 1 week of publication

---

### 4. Product/Service Evolution
**Examples:**
- Confluent frontend launch (Q4 2025)
- Bioaugmentation service launch (future)
- New biosensor panel capabilities
- Multi-site deployment capability

**Trigger:** Product milestone achieved and ready for market
**Review Scope:** Solutions pages, Homepage (Three-Tier description), About page (strategic focus)
**Timeline:** Coordinated with product launch

---

### 5. Competitive Landscape Shifts
**Examples:**
- Major competitor launches similar technology
- FTIR or HRMS providers change positioning
- New environmental data platforms enter market
- Industry consolidation affecting competitive positioning

**Trigger:** Competitive intelligence review (quarterly)
**Review Scope:** Homepage (differentiation messaging), Solutions pages (competitive positioning)
**Timeline:** Quarterly competitive review cycle

---

### 6. Performance Data (Analytics-Driven)
**Examples:**
- High bounce rate on specific page (content not resonating)
- Low conversion on specific CTA (messaging unclear)
- Unexpected persona pathway patterns (operators going to scientist page first)
- SEO keyword opportunities identified

**Trigger:** Monthly analytics review
**Review Scope:** Underperforming pages, CTA optimization, SEO keyword integration
**Timeline:** Monthly quick wins, quarterly deeper optimization

---

## Update Process (Step-by-Step)

### Step 1: Identify Trigger Event
- Regulatory announcement published
- Master Context updated with strategic change
- New peer-reviewed paper accepted
- Product milestone achieved
- Analytics showing performance issue

**Document in Master Context Continuous Improvement Log:**
```
[DATE] Website Update Trigger: [Event Description]
Scope: [Which pages affected]
Rationale: [Why this requires website update]
```

---

### Step 2: Review Affected Content Files
**Location:** `02-COMPANY-ASSETS/marketing/communications-assets/Website-Redesign-Strategy-20250917/`

**Files to Review:**
- `Homepage-Content.md` (if trigger affects core messaging)
- `Solutions-Operators.md` / `Solutions-Regulators.md` / `Solutions-Scientists.md` (if persona-specific)
- `Resource-Hub.md` (if new downloadable content created)
- `About-Purpose.md` (if strategic focus or team changes)

**Cross-reference with:**
- `Website-Redesign-Master-Memory.md` (strategic foundation, content standards, tone requirements)
- Master Context file (current business strategy, messaging framework)
- Latest Internal Papers (Executive Brief, Solution Overview, White Paper for messaging consistency)

---

### Step 3: Update Content Files (Edit Markdown Files)

**Editing Checklist:**
- [ ] Does update align with Master Context current strategy?
- [ ] Does tone match "humble Canadian confidence" standard?
- [ ] Are data/numbers accurate and sourced?
- [ ] Are limitations acknowledged honestly?
- [ ] Is Three-Tier Strategy framework maintained?
- [ ] Does this stay LEAN (visual-first, minimal words)?

**Word Count Discipline:**
- Homepage: ~500 words max
- Solutions pages: ~400 words max
- Resource Hub: ~200 words (mostly teaser cards)
- About page: ~400 words max

**If update requires more explanation, create a downloadable resource instead of bloating website page.**

---

### Step 4: Review Against Content Standards

**Mandatory Standards (From Master Memory File):**

**Tone Check:**
✅ Conservative claims, honest limitations
✅ Data-first (real numbers over descriptions)
✅ Humble positioning ("important part of solution" not "revolutionary")
❌ No grandiose language ("breakthrough," "transformational," "industry-leading")

**Three-Tier Framework:**
✅ HRMS acknowledged as gold standard
✅ Biosensor positioned as complementary operational screening
✅ Confluent positioned as AI-native intelligence platform
✅ Integrated value clearly stated (Biosensor + Confluent together > sum of parts)

**Authority Building:**
✅ Peer-reviewed foundation cited
✅ Field validation data included
✅ Honest limitations discussed
✅ Operational understanding demonstrated

---

### Step 5: Implement Changes to Live Website

**Pre-Launch Checklist:**
- [ ] All internal links working (Resources, Solutions pages)
- [ ] All download CTAs functional (gated PDFs set up)
- [ ] Images/visuals updated if needed (correlation plots, dashboard mockups, Three-Tier diagram)
- [ ] SEO meta descriptions updated
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness tested
- [ ] Analytics tracking confirmed

**Implementation:**
- Update live website with edited content
- Test all conversion points (download buttons, briefing scheduler, persona CTAs)
- Verify visual assets displaying correctly

---

### Step 6: Update Master Memory File Change Log

**Location:** `Website-Redesign-Master-Memory.md` → Section: "Change Log"

**Entry Format:**
```
### [DATE] - [Update Title]
- **Trigger:** [What caused this update - regulatory announcement, strategic pivot, etc.]
- **Changes:** [Which pages updated, what specifically changed]
- **Rationale:** [Why this update was necessary - alignment with new strategy, regulatory compliance, etc.]
- **Metrics Baseline:** [Note any relevant before/after analytics - traffic, conversions, engagement]
```

**Example:**
```
### December 15, 2025 - Confluent Frontend Launch Update
- **Trigger:** Confluent frontend interfaces deployed Q4 2025
- **Changes:**
  - Homepage: Updated Tier 3 description from "Q4 2025 deployment" to "Operational platform"

```

---

### Step 7: Monitor Impact (Analytics Review)

**Track These Metrics Post-Update:**
- Traffic changes to updated pages
- Bounce rate improvements/declines
- Conversion rate changes (downloads, briefing requests)
- Persona pathway shifts (are operators finding regulator page more now?)
- SEO ranking changes for target keywords

**Review Timeline:**
- **1 week post-update:** Initial impact assessment
- **1 month post-update:** Full performance evaluation
- **Quarterly:** Aggregate impact across all updates

**Document findings in Master Memory File if significant patterns emerge.**

---

## Review Cadence (Scheduled Maintenance)

### Monthly Review (Analytics-Driven Quick Wins)
**Focus:** Performance optimization
- Review Google Analytics: traffic, bounce rates, conversions
- Identify underperforming pages or CTAs
- Test headline variations, CTA button copy
- Quick content tweaks (< 1 hour effort)

**Owner:** Jeff or designated marketing lead
**Output:** 1-3 quick win optimizations implemented

---

### Quarterly Review (Strategic Alignment Check)
**Focus:** Major content updates and strategic consistency
- Full website audit against Master Context
- Competitive positioning review (has landscape shifted?)
- New authority content creation (3-4 high-value assets per quarter)
- Resource Hub additions (new case studies, regulatory frameworks, technical papers)

**Owner:** Jeff + team (CSO for scientific content, CTO for technical specs)
**Output:** Quarterly update package (new downloads, page refreshes, SEO improvements)

---

### Semi-Annual Review (Comprehensive Audit)
**Focus:** Messaging evolution and major redesign needs
- Full website content vs. Master Context strategic alignment
- Messaging framework evolution (is Three-Tier still primary? new competitive differentiation?)
- Visual asset refresh needs (new correlation plots, updated dashboard mockups)
- SEO strategy assessment (keyword performance, content gaps)
- Conversion funnel optimization (homepage → persona page → download → briefing journey)

**Owner:** Jeff + external review if needed (marketing consultant, messaging expert)
**Output:** Strategic website roadmap for next 6 months

---

## Decision Framework (When Updating Website Copy)

**Use this checklist for EVERY website content update:**

### 1. Strategic Alignment
- [ ] Does this reflect current 18-24 month focus (monitoring + intelligence)?
- [ ] Does this acknowledge HRMS as required gold standard?
- [ ] Does this position Biosensor + Confluent as integrated platform?
- [ ] Is bioaugmentation referenced appropriately (R&D vs. current offering)?

### 2. Tone Check
- [ ] Is this humble Canadian confidence? (conservative claims, honest limitations)
- [ ] Would a skeptical Calgary oil & gas veteran find this credible?
- [ ] Am I showing data first, descriptions second?
- [ ] Are there any grandiose claims to remove?

### 3. Persona Relevance
- [ ] Which stakeholder is this for? (Operator, Regulator, Scientist)
- [ ] Does it address their specific pain point?
- [ ] Is technical depth appropriate for audience?
- [ ] Is the CTA relevant to their journey stage?

### 4. Competitive Positioning
- [ ] Am I positioning as complementary (good) or replacement (bad)?
- [ ] Am I highlighting integrated intelligence differentiation?
- [ ] Am I acknowledging limitations honestly?
- [ ] Does this avoid comparison battles we can't win?

### 5. Authority Building
- [ ] Do I cite peer-reviewed sources?
- [ ] Do I include real numbers (correlation coefficients, detection ranges)?
- [ ] Do I discuss what we CAN'T do alongside what we CAN?
- [ ] Is field validation data referenced where appropriate?

### 6. Lean Discipline
- [ ] Is this visual-first, words-second?
- [ ] Can I cut 30% of words and strengthen the message?
- [ ] Should this be a downloadable resource instead of website copy?
- [ ] Am I respecting word count targets (Homepage 500, Solutions 400)?

**If ANY checklist item fails, revise before publishing.**

## Final Reminder: Less Is More

**Every update should ask:**
- Can this be visual instead of text?
- Can this be a downloadable resource instead of website copy?
- Can I cut 30% of words and strengthen the message?

**Website validates and intrigues. Downloads provide depth. Briefings convert.**

**Don't try to answer every question on the website. Make them want to learn more.**

**End of Continuous Improvement Workflow**

*This workflow ensures the website stays aligned with evolving strategy without becoming bloated or outdated. Review quarterly. Refine as needed.*
