## What We Offer (Two-Part Solution)

### Tier 2: Biosensor Screening Platform
**24-hour NA detection for daily operational monitoring**

- High correlation (R > 0.9) with HRMS on real OSPW samples
- Peer-reviewed validation (*ACS Synthetic Biology*, 2024)
- Field-tested: Kearl multi-season wetland study
- Service-based model: test daily without per-sample charges
- 10-50x monitoring increase within existing budgets

**Technical specs:** Three-panel detection targeting acyclic, complex/aromatic, and classical NA fractions. 92% success rate in raw OSPW with minimal sample preparation. Detection range optimized for 2-30 mg/L.

### Tier 3: Confluent AI Intelligence Platform
**Transform monitoring data into operational insights**

- Natural language queries: *"What worked when NA levels spiked last year?"*
- Multi-stakeholder dashboards (Operator/Regulator/Community views)
- Unified data platform: biosensor + HRMS + historical PDFs + SCADA
- Immutable audit trail for regulatory compliance
- Gets smarter with every dataset added

**Technical architecture:** AI-native from inception—graph database (TerminusDB) + model-agnostic orchestration (Claude, GPT-4, Gemini) + vector search (Qdrant) for semantic querying.

## Value by Audience

### For Oil Sands Operators
**Catch treatment failures in days, not months**

**The problem:** Kearl wetland study showed how sparse HRMS data misses mid-season degradation changes—discovered too late to optimize. Budget constraints force a choice between spatial coverage OR monitoring frequency.

**What Luminous enables:**
- Early detection: Biosensor spots problems in 72 hours vs. 4-month HRMS lag
- Data-driven optimization: High-frequency data enables A/B testing with statistical significance
- Strategic HRMS deployment: Use gold standard for quarterly validation while biosensor handles daily screening
- Comprehensive coverage: 10-50x more monitoring within existing budgets

**Result:** $2-5M avoided costs per treatment failure, timelines maintained, regulatory approval de-risked.

### For Regulators & Policy Makers
**Multi-stakeholder transparency addressing OSMWSC requirements**

**The mandate:** September 2025 OSMWSC recommendation for technology transparency with Indigenous communities and stakeholders.

**What Luminous enables:**
- Same trusted data, three dashboard views (Operator/Regulator/Community)
- Real-time monitoring access (not quarterly reports)
- Plain language presentation for community view (color-coded maps, safety thresholds)
- Immutable audit trail (no retroactive changes)
- Automated AER-compliant exports

**Result:** Operators demonstrate good-faith transparency through real-time data access. Communities verify treatment progress independently. Regulators access comprehensive datasets before requiring submission.

---

### For Scientists & Researchers
**Peer-reviewed validation with honest limitations**

**What we've published:**
- *ACS Synthetic Biology* (2024) - Biosensor validation
- Kearl field study results: 36% NA reduction over 98 days, biosensor vs. Orbitrap MS correlation (R > 0.9)
- Additional papers expected year-end 2025

**What we acknowledge:**
- HRMS remains required for regulatory compliance—we complement it, we don't replace it
- Biosensor detection range optimized for 2-30 mg/L
- We address NA specifically; other contaminants need separate solutions

**AI-native differentiation:** Confluent was built from inception on graph databases and LLMs (not retrofitted). Platform intelligence compounds with every dataset added—Day 1 < Month 3 < Year 2 in analytical capability.

### For Indigenous Communities
**Real-time monitoring access with plain language presentation**

**Respectful engagement:** Oil sands water treatment affects communities whose lands and waters have borne decades of operational impact. Quarterly reports feel like "trust us"—real-time monitoring data says "see for yourself."

**What Luminous offers:**
- Community-specific dashboard (color-coded safety maps, plain language)
- Real-time updates (last updated: 2 hours ago)
- NA levels shown relative to safety thresholds
- Same data regulators and operators see—appropriate presentation for each audience

**Our commitment:** Technology alone doesn't build trust. We're seeking to engage meaningfully with affected communities to understand what information access would genuinely serve their needs. This is ongoing work requiring listening, not just offering solutions.
