## Our Mission

Oil sands operators are transitioning from 60 years of containment to regulated water release—but this depends entirely on solving the Naphthenic Acid monitoring challenge. HRMS can't scale to operational needs. Sparse quarterly data can't optimize dynamic biological treatment.

**Luminous BioSolutions provides NA operational intelligence:** 24-hour biosensor screening + AI-native Confluent platform = data-driven treatment optimization and multi-stakeholder transparency.

We're enabling a pathway from containment to release through actionable monitoring. This is about enablement (closure is possible), not fear (preventing catastrophe).

## What We Do

**We're a monitoring and data intelligence company focused on one problem:**
- **Biosensor:** Peer-reviewed (*ACS Synthetic Biology*, 2024), field-tested at Kearl wetland
- **Confluent AI:** Multi-stakeholder dashboards, natural language querying, predictive analytics

**What we acknowledge:**
- HRMS remains the compliance gold standard—we complement it, we don't replace it
- We solve NA monitoring specifically; other contaminants need separate solutions
- Future bioaugmentation R&D underway, not a current offering

## Our Commitment to Respectful Engagement

Oil sands operations have impacted Indigenous lands and waters for decades. We've built real-time monitoring tools to provide transparent data access—but we know technology is only part of building trust. We're committed to engaging meaningfully with affected communities to ensure transparency tools serve their actual information needs.
