## The Scientific Foundation (One Paragraph + Data)

**Biosensor Technology:**
Three-panel detection system targeting acyclic, complex/aromatic, and classical NA fractions. Published in *ACS Synthetic Biology* (2024). Field-validated through multi-season Kearl engineered wetland study—head-to-head comparison with Orbitrap Mass Spectrometry on real OSPW samples, not just controlled lab conditions. **Performance: 92% success rate in raw OSPW, minimal sample preparation, high correlation with MS.**

**Honest limitations:**
HRMS remains required for regulatory compliance—we acknowledge this explicitly. Biosensor detection range optimized for 2-30 mg/L. We're addressing the NA bottleneck specifically; other contaminants need separate solutions. We're complementary, not comprehensive.

## The AI-Native Differentiation (Visual + Technical Specs)

### Confluent Architecture

**What Makes It AI-Native:**
Built from inception on graph databases and large language models—not a traditional database with AI bolted on later.

**Technical Stack:**
- **Graph Database:** TerminusDB (explicit relationship mapping)
- **AI Orchestration:** Model-agnostic (Claude, GPT-4, Gemini)
- **Unified Data:** Structured (biosensor, HRMS, SCADA) + Unstructured (PDFs, reports)
- **Vector Search:** Qdrant (semantic querying across decades of documents)

**Compounding Intelligence:**
Platform gets smarter with every dataset added. Day 1 < Month 3 < Year 2 in analytical capability.

## Field Validation Summary (Data-First)

**Kearl Wetland Study Results:**
- 36% total NA reduction over 98 days
- Removal rates: 0.25-0.53 mg/L/day
- O₂-NAFCs (most toxic) declined from 65% → 45%
- Biosensor correlation with Orbitrap MS: R > 0.9

**Why This Matters:**
Demonstrates biosensor performance under actual operational conditions with minimal sample preparation on real OSPW matrices.
