## **Launch Sequence (Recommended)**

### **Phase 1: Soft Launch (Internal Review)**

**Timeline:** 2-3 days

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Build complete on staging site (not live/public yet)
- [ ] Review all content files implemented correctly
- [ ] Test all CTAs (downloads, briefing scheduler, persona paths)
- [ ] Test mobile responsiveness on multiple devices (phone, tablet)
- [ ] Internal team review:
  - [ ] Dr. Shawn Lewenza (scientific accuracy)
  - [ ] Greg Saunders (technical accuracy, Confluent description)
  - [ ] Jeff Violo (strategic alignment, tone, messaging)
- [ ] Make revisions based on internal feedback

**Questions to Ask During Internal Review:**
- Does this accurately represent our technology?
- Are we overclaiming or underclaiming?
- Is the tone "humble Canadian confidence"?
- Would a prospect understand our value proposition?
- Are there any factual errors or outdated information?

---

### **Phase 2: Beta Launch (Friendly Audience)**

**Timeline:** 1 week

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Launch publicly but don't announce broadly
- [ ] Send to 5-10 friendly contacts for honest feedback:
  - Industry advisors
  - University partners
  - Supportive early customers/prospects
  - Consultant partners (e.g., Stantec contacts)
- [ ] Email template for beta testers:

```
Subject: Quick favor - website feedback?

Hi [Name],

We just updated the Luminous website to better explain our NA monitoring platform. Before we announce it broadly, I'd love your honest feedback:

www.luminousbiosolutions.com

Specifically:
- Does the credibility come through? (peer-reviewed, field-tested)
- Is the value proposition clear?
- Would you download the executive brief?
- Anything confusing or missing?

10 minutes of your time would be hugely valuable. Brutal honesty appreciated.

Thanks,
Jeff
```

- [ ] Track analytics for 1 week (watch behavior)
- [ ] Collect feedback and identify patterns
- [ ] Make quick wins improvements before full launch

**Key Metrics to Watch:**
- Bounce rate (target: <60%)
- Time on page (target: 2+ minutes homepage, 1.5+ min Solutions pages)
- Download conversions (how many of 10 beta testers download something?)
- Briefing requests (any?)

---

### **Phase 3: Full Launch**

**Timeline:** Launch day + 2 weeks active promotion

**Launch Day Checklist:**
- [ ] Final QA check (all links, forms, downloads working)
- [ ] Analytics confirmed tracking
- [ ] Monitor website performance (uptime, speed)

**Announcement Strategy:**

**1. LinkedIn (Primary Channel)**
- [ ] Jeff's personal profile post:
```
After months of field validation and peer review, we're excited to share an updated view of our NA intelligence platform.

The challenge: Oil sands operators moving from containment to regulated release need operational monitoring that scales. HRMS can't answer "Is treatment working right now?"

Our approach: Integrated three-tier strategy
- Tier 1: HRMS (compliance validation)
- Tier 2: Biosensor (24-hour operational screening)
- Tier 3: Confluent AI (intelligence + transparency)

Not just better monitoring. Integrated intelligence.

Explore the science, validation data, and business case:
www.luminousbiosolutions.com

Honest feedback welcome.

- [ ] Monitor form submissions (downloads working? emails delivering?)
- [ ] Review any contact form inquiries (respond within 24 hours)

**Weekly (Weeks 2-4):**
- [ ] Review analytics dashboard:
  - Which persona path getting most traffic?
  - Which resources being downloaded most?
  - Any unexpected bounce rates?
  - Mobile vs. desktop split?
- [ ] A/B test opportunities:
  - Homepage headline variations
  - CTA button copy
  - Value card order
- [ ] Note any patterns for continuous improvement

**Month 1 Report:**
- [ ] Total traffic (visitors, sessions, pageviews)
- [ ] Conversion rate (downloads per visitor)
- [ ] Top landing pages (where do people enter?)
- [ ] Top exit pages (where do people leave?)
- [ ] Persona pathway split (Operators vs. Regulators vs. Scientists)
- [ ] Resource downloads by type (which is most popular?)
- [ ] Technical briefing requests (qualified leads)

## **What You're About to Launch**

**A lean, credible, honest website that:**

✅ **Validates immediately**
- Peer-reviewed (ACS Synthetic Biology, 2024)
- Field-tested (Kearl multi-season wetland validation)
- Industry-engaged (CNRL, Suncor, Imperial conversations)
- University partnerships (Athabasca, Calgary)

✅ **Clarifies value proposition**
- Three-Tier Strategy shows integration at a glance
- Visual-first communication (diagrams do 50% of work)
- Persona-specific value propositions

✅ **Respects audience intelligence**
- Minimal words, maximum clarity
- No marketing fluff or grandiose claims
- Honest limitations acknowledged

✅ **Drives to depth strategically**
- Website validates credibility and intrigues
- Downloads provide technical detail
- Briefings convert to pilot programs

✅ **Acknowledges honestly**
- HRMS is gold standard (we complement, not replace)
- Indigenous engagement is ongoing work (we're listening, not claiming)
- Limitations stated alongside capabilities

✅ **Differentiates architecturally**
- Integrated intelligence platform (not just better monitoring)
- AI-native Confluent (not database with AI bolted on)

- [ ] Are limitations acknowledged honestly?

**Technical Functionality:**
