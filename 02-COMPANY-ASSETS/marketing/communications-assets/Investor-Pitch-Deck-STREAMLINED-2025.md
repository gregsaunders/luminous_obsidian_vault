LUMINOUS BIOSOLUTIONS

Solving the Naphthenic Acid Bottleneck
$1.5M Seed | $30B Market

Jeff Violo, COO | jeff.violo@luminousbiosolutions.com
```

### SPEAKER NOTES (30 sec):

"Thank you for your time. I'm going to show you a $30 billion problem that's been unsolvable for 50 years—and why the next 18 months create a once-in-a-generation window to solve it.

The oil sands industry can't release 1.4 trillion liters of water largely because they can't prove one contaminant—Naphthenic Acids—are safe. And they're managing this blindly.

Let's talk about why now, why us, and why this is investable."

## SLIDE 2: The Problem

**Title:** Flying Blind on a $30B Liability

**Visual:** Split screen - Left: 3 stat boxes with icons | Right: Large tailings pond photo

### Slide Content:

**THE SCALE**
- 1.4 trillion liters
- $30-130B liability
- NAs blocking release approval

**THE BLIND SPOT**
- HRMS: $1,000/sample, 8 weeks
- 9 samples over 2 seasons
- Treatment failures detected months late

**THE BOTTLENECK**
- Multiple contaminants exist
- **NAs are the regulatory blocker**
- No operational monitoring exists

### SPEAKER NOTES (75 sec):

"Oil sands operators face a unique challenge. Unlike every other mining operation, they've never had release approval. For 50 years, the answer was: contain it, don't release it.

Now that's changing. Production doubling. Capacity maxing out. Indigenous communities demanding proof water is safe.

But here's the problem: **Naphthenic Acids**—one of the principal contaminants—are impossible to monitor operationally. HRMS costs $1,000 per sample and takes 8 weeks.

A recent wetland study? 9 samples over 2 field seasons. When treatment failed mid-season, they didn't discover it until the following year. That's a multi-million dollar system flying blind.

Operators need to monitor multiple contaminants—metals, salts, organics. But NAs are the regulatory bottleneck preventing release approval. You can't release water if NA levels aren't proven safe."

## SLIDE 3: Why Now?

**Title:** The Perfect Storm

**Visual:** Center circle with 4 arrows pointing in, each labeled with pressure type + icon

### Slide Content:

**CENTER: 12-18 MONTH WINDOW**

**4 CONVERGING PRESSURES:**
1. **REGULATORY** → Sept 2025 OSMWSC mandate
2. **ECONOMIC** → Production doubling, no expansion without release
3. **PHYSICAL** → Treatment tech exists, can't optimize without data
4. **SOCIAL LICENSE** → Indigenous communities demand proof

### SPEAKER NOTES (60 sec):

"Why is this venture-backable now?

Four pressures converging create a 12-18 month window:

**Regulatory:** OSMWSC September 2025 recommendations mandate treat-and-release with stakeholder transparency. NAs explicitly identified as key contaminant.

**Economic:** Can't expand production without proving water release. Billions in stranded assets.

**Physical:** Treatment technologies exist—wetlands, bioaugmentation—but you can't optimize without 10-50x more data.

**Social license:** Indigenous communities want independent verification. Trust at historic lows.

This is a once-in-a-generation forcing function. Operators must build monitoring infrastructure now."

---

## SLIDE 4: The Three-Tier Strategy

**Title:** How Operators Will Solve This (And Where We Fit)

**Visual:** 3 columns with icons, color-coded (Navy/Teal/Coral)

### Slide Content:

**TIER 1: COMPLIANCE**
HRMS
- $1K, 8 weeks
- Gold standard
- **Already exists**

**TIER 2: OPERATIONS**
Luminous Biosensor
- $100, 24 hours
- 10-50x frequency
- **← WE PROVIDE**

**TIER 3: INTELLIGENCE**
Confluent AI Platform
- Real-time insights
- Stakeholder transparency
- **← WE PROVIDE**

**Bottom text:** *Operators need all 3. HRMS exists. Luminous provides Tier 2 + 3.*

### SPEAKER NOTES (75 sec):

"To solve the NA bottleneck, operators need three tiers—not one.

**Tier 1: HRMS.** Gold standard. $1,000 per sample, 8 weeks. Perfect for compliance, useless for operations. This already exists.

**Tier 2: Our biosensor.** Specifically targets NAs. $100 per test, 24 hours. Enables 10-50x more monitoring. **This doesn't exist today. We provide it.**

**Tier 3: Confluent.** AI-native platform. Turns high-frequency data into operational insights and stakeholder transparency. Currently focused on NAs, architecture expandable to other contaminants. **This doesn't exist. We provide it.**

Here's the key: **Operators need all three tiers.** Tier 1 exists—we're not replacing HRMS. Tier 2 and 3 for NAs? That's Luminous.

We're complementary, not competitive. That makes us must-have, not nice-to-have."

## SLIDE 5: The Solution

**Title:** What You're Investing In

**Visual:** Split layout with biosensor left, Confluent right, "+" in center

### Slide Content:

**BIOSENSOR (Tier 2)**
- Peer-reviewed (ACS Synth Bio 2024)
- Specifically targets NAs
- <24hr, <$100
- 10-50x more data

*Photo: Glowing bacteria*

**CONFLUENT (Tier 3)**
- AI-native for NA intelligence
- Graph database + LLMs
- Natural language queries
- Multi-stakeholder dashboards

*Visual: Network diagram*

**Bottom:** *Biosensor = operational data. Confluent = competitive advantage.*

### SPEAKER NOTES (90 sec):

"What exactly are you investing in?

**The biosensor:** Peer-reviewed, ACS Synthetic Biology 2024. Engineered bacteria that glow when they detect NAs. Less than 24 hours, under $100 per test. **Specifically targets Naphthenic Acids**—not all contaminants, just the regulatory bottleneck.

Operators go from quarterly HRMS snapshots to daily operational screening. That's 10-50x more data at a fraction of the cost.

**Confluent:** AI-native platform currently focused on NA intelligence. Unifies biosensor results, HRMS validation, SCADA, weather, historical PDFs—everything—into one queryable system.

Operators ask questions in plain English: 'Show me where NA levels spiked after rainfall in the last 3 years.' System returns maps, trends, historical context, recommendations.

Multi-stakeholder dashboards: operators, regulators, Indigenous communities all see the same data. That's not compliance—that's competitive advantage.

Architecture designed to expand to other contaminants as operators scale, but today we're laser-focused on the NA bottleneck."

## SLIDE 6: Validation

**Title:** De-Risked Technology

**Visual:** 3 columns with journal covers on right

### Slide Content:

**SCIENTIFIC**
- ACS Synth Bio (2024)
- Patents: CA, US, PCT
- University partnerships

**FIELD-TESTED**
- Imperial Kearl pilot
- 22/24 samples validated
- High HRMS correlation

**THE MOAT**
- Proprietary NA degradation dataset
- Peer-reviewed = 3-5yr barrier
- OSMWSC regulatory alignment

### SPEAKER NOTES (60 sec):

"Is this real? Is it validated? What's the moat?

**Scientific:** Peer-reviewed in ACS Synthetic Biology. Patents filed. University partnerships at Athabasca and Calgary provide independent credibility.

**Field-tested:** Multi-season pilot at Imperial Kearl. Tested on real OSPW, high correlation with gold-standard Orbitrap Mass Spec. Successfully tracked NA reduction from 70 mg/L to 36 mg/L.

During that study we proved the gap: operators collected only 9 NA samples over 2 field seasons. Treatment failed mid-season, discovered a year later. We validated the technology and the need.

**The moat:** Every deployment builds a proprietary NA degradation dataset. Predictive models improve with each customer. Competitors can't replicate peer-reviewed credibility or the data advantage. They're starting years behind."

## SLIDE 7: Market

**Title:** Concentrated, Accessible, Urgent

**Visual:** Target diagram with company logos | Revenue table

### Slide Content:

**TAM:** $30-130B liability

**SAM:** Top 3 operators = 80%
- CNRL
- Imperial
- Suncor

**SOM:** $6-20M ARR (18-24mo)
- $2-5M/operator: Biosensor testing
- $500K-1M/operator: Platform SaaS
- $500K-1M/operator: Integration

**TIMING:** 12-18mo window = first-mover advantage

### SPEAKER NOTES (75 sec):

"Why is this investable?

**Concentrated market.** Top 3 operators—CNRL, Imperial, Suncor—represent 80% of oil sands production. We're not chasing hundreds of customers. We're targeting 3-5 massive operators with urgent need.

**Our serviceable obtainable market:** $6-20M ARR within 18-24 months. Each major operator represents $3-7M annually—biosensor testing, platform SaaS, integration services.

**We have direct access.** CDL Rockies mentors include Steve Laut, Vice Chair of CNRL. That's a warm intro to the largest operator.

**Regulatory forcing function.** OSMWSC September 2025 mandate creates 12-18 month window. Operators who build monitoring infrastructure now gain compliance leadership advantage.

**Multi-decade revenue.** Treatment is a 20-30 year process. Monitoring required throughout. Once Confluent becomes system of record, switching costs are massive. This is sticky, recurring revenue."

## SLIDE 10: Positioning

**Title:** Complementary, Not Competitive

**Visual:** 2x2 matrix (Frequency vs. Regulatory Acceptance)

### Slide Content:

**MATRIX:**

**Top Left:** HRMS (Tier 1)
*High acceptance, low frequency*

**Bottom Right:** Luminous (Tier 2)
*High frequency, operational*
→ Arrow to HRMS: "Complements"

**Overlay:** Confluent (Tier 3)
*Connects everything*

**Bottom:** *We don't replace HRMS. We make it more strategic.*

### SPEAKER NOTES (45 sec):

"Critical positioning: **We don't replace HRMS. We complement it.**

HRMS is gold standard for compliance. It's not going anywhere. But $1,000 per sample, 8 weeks—useless for operations.

Our biosensor enables daily operational screening. When it flags an anomaly, operators deploy targeted HRMS validation.

**Before Luminous:** 10-20 HRMS samples per year. $7-20K spend. Blind to operational trends.

**With Luminous:** 100-500 biosensor tests + 10-20 HRMS validations. $17-70K total. 10-50x more data, optimized treatment, maintained compliance.

We're selling into existing budget, not displacing entrenched solution. That's defensible."
