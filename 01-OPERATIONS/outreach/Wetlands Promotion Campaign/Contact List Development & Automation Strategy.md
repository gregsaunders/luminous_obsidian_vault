# 🎯 Contact List Development & Automation Strategy
## V2.0 - Expanded for Maximum March 5 Attendance

> [!summary] Goal
> Build an extensive targeted list of 350-400 contacts across Oil Sands Operators, Academia, Regulatory bodies, Consultants, and **Indigenous Relations** to drive maximum attendance to Dr. Shawn Lewenza's March 5th [[GROW Project]] presentation and promote all GROW seminar sessions to establish ecosystem credibility.

> [!important] Strategic Context
> This campaign promotes BOTH the Luminous presentation AND the broader GROW findings (Curl Wetland Girl pilot results). Goal: Position as collaborative partner in the GROW ecosystem, not just vendor promoting our technology.

## ⚙️ Execution Strategy: The Hybrid Approach (Expanded)

We will use a mix of manual research for high-value targets and automation for volume, with emphasis on relationship-first approach for Indigenous contacts.

### Phase 1: GROW Ecosystem First (Week 1 - PRIORITY)
* **Target:** Existing GROW consortium participants, presenters, attendees
* **Method:**
  1. Request full GROW consortium member list from `grow@ucalgary.ca`
  2. Request March 5 presenter roster (promote ALL sessions, not just Luminous)
  3. Review GROW publications for author/acknowledgment lists
  4. Check GROW website for advisory board, steering committee members
* **Why First:** These contacts already understand the context, have invested time in OSPW research, and are most likely to attend
* **Quality:** 100% accuracy
* **Expected Count:** 40-60 contacts

### Phase 2: High-Priority Manual Research (Week 1)
* **Target:** Top 50-70 decision-makers at Operators (Environmental + Financial + Indigenous Relations)
* **Companies:** Suncor, CNRL, Imperial, Cenovus (focus on top 4)
* **Method:**
  1. Manual LinkedIn research for specific titles
  2. Company website leadership pages
  3. Email verification via **Hunter.io**
  4. Cross-reference with public presentations/conference speakers
* **Quality:** 95%+ accuracy
* **Expected Count:** 50-70 contacts

### Phase 3: Indigenous Relations Relationship Mapping (Week 1)
* **Target:** Indigenous Relations contacts at operators + First Nations environmental coordinators
* **Method:**
  1. Manual research (LinkedIn + company Indigenous Relations pages)
  2. Review operator sustainability reports for Indigenous partnership contacts
  3. Check First Nations websites for environmental/lands departments
  4. **IMPORTANT:** No mass automated outreach to Indigenous contacts - build list for relationship-first engagement
* **Quality:** 95%+ accuracy (manual verification required)
* **Expected Count:** 30-40 contacts
* **Special Note:** Email messaging for this segment must emphasize OSMWSC transparency recommendation and independent third-party positioning (see messaging section below)

### Phase 4: Automated Medium-Priority (Week 1-2)
* **Target:** Academics, Consultants, Regulatory, Additional Operators
* **Method:**
  1. **LinkedIn Sales Navigator** searches with saved filters
  2. Export to CSV
  3. Enrich with **Apollo.io** (email finder + verification)
  4. Manual review of titles for relevance
* **Quality:** 75-85% accuracy
* **Expected Count:** 180-220 contacts

### Phase 5: Conference & Publication Lists (Week 2)
* **Target:** Researchers who've published on OSPW/naphthenic acids/wetlands in last 3 years
* **Method:**
  1. Search Google Scholar for: "naphthenic acids" + "oil sands" + 2022-2025
  2. Extract author affiliations and emails from publications
  3. Check Oil Sands Research & Information Network (OSRIN) conference proceedings
  4. Review Alberta Wetland Science Conference attendee/presenter lists
* **Quality:** 80-90% accuracy
* **Expected Count:** 30-50 contacts

## 🚨 Special Handling: Indigenous Relations Contacts

### **Why This Segment Requires Different Approach:**

**Cultural Sensitivity:**
- Mass automated email campaigns can be perceived as disrespectful
- Relationship-first approach is essential (not transactional)
- OSMWSC recommendation provides credible context, but execution matters

**Recommended Approach:**

**Step 1: Personal Introduction (Not Mass Email)**
- [ ] Jeff or Dr. Lewenza personal email (not automated sequence)
- [ ] Reference OSMWSC transparency recommendation explicitly
- [ ] Emphasize independent third-party positioning (not operator tool)
- [ ] Invite feedback on monitoring approach (consultative tone)

**Step 2: Follow-Up Call (If No Response in 7 Days)**
- [ ] Phone call from Jeff (not just email)
- [ ] Offer to present monitoring approach in person/video call
- [ ] Frame as seeking input on transparent monitoring design

**Step 3: No Pressure Tactics**
- [ ] Do NOT use countdown timers or "last chance" language
- [ ] Do NOT add to multi-touch automated sequences
- [ ] Respect if they decline or don't respond

**Email Template for Indigenous Relations Segment:**

**Subject:** Independent OSPW monitoring approach (seeking your perspective)

**Body:**
[First Name],

The Oil Sands Mine Water Steering Committee recently recommended that "operators should strive to share information about pilot technologies with Indigenous communities to ensure awareness and build trust."

I'm reaching out because Luminous BioSolutions is presenting independent, third-party monitoring technology at the University of Calgary GROW Seminar on March 5th—and we believe transparent data access for Indigenous monitors and communities is essential to building trust.

**Our approach:**
- Biosensors isolated from Alberta tailings pond bacteria (local provenance)
- Independent third-party monitoring (not operator-generated data)
- Real-time transparent access for Indigenous partners and regulators
- Validated through University of Calgary GROW Project consortium

**I'm not asking you to commit to anything.** I'm inviting you to see our approach at the March 5 presentation and hear your perspective on whether independent monitoring can support the kind of transparency Indigenous communities are asking for.

If you're interested, here's the registration link: [LINK]

If you'd prefer to discuss this by phone first, I'm happy to set up a call at your convenience.

Thank you for considering this.

Best regards,
Jeff Violo
Luminous BioSolutions

**P.S.** If you know others in your community who work on environmental monitoring or water quality issues, please feel free to forward this invitation. We want to ensure Indigenous voices are part of these conversations.

## 📝 Notes for Jeff

**Key Strategic Decisions:**

1. **Indigenous Relations Approach:** This segment is critical for trust-first positioning but requires manual, relationship-first outreach. Recommend Jeff handle these personally (not delegated to automated sequence).

2. **GROW Ecosystem Emphasis:** Promote ALL GROW sessions (not just Luminous presentation) to position as collaborative partner in ecosystem, not just vendor. This builds credibility.

3. **Segment-Specific Messaging:** Six email variants aligned with v2.3 trust-first framework. Each segment sees messaging most relevant to their priorities.

4. **Target Flexibility:** Sourcing 380-520 contacts initially to account for deduplication/bounces. Final clean list target: 350-400. This gives buffer for list quality.

5. **Tools Budget:** $150-200/mo is sufficient for 350-400 contacts. Skip ZoomInfo unless critical execs unreachable through other methods.

**Questions for Jeff:**

1. Do you have existing relationships with any Indigenous Relations contacts that could warm-intro this outreach?
2. Should Dr. Lewenza co-sign emails to Indigenous Relations segment (academic credibility)?
3. Any GROW consortium members you've already connected with who could help promote to their networks?
4. Budget approval for tools ($150-200/mo for 2 months)?

---

**Status:** Ready for execution. Recommend starting Week 1 tasks immediately (GROW outreach + manual operator research) to hit Feb 3 launch date.

**Next Step:** Jeff reviews and approves approach, then begins Week 1 foundation building.
