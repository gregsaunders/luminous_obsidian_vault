# Project GROW: Genomics Research for Optimizing Treatment Wetlands

> **Core Mission:** To revolutionize the treatment of Oil Sands Process-affected Water (OSPW) by integrating cutting-edge genomics with natural, constructed wetland systems to create a sustainable, "green" solution for industrial water remediation.

---

## 🔬 Project Overview

The GROW project addresses a critical environmental legacy of Canada's oil sands mining: the accumulation of toxic process water. By studying the **plant-microbe interactions** at a molecular level, the project aims to optimize **Constructed Wetland Treatment Systems (CWTS)** to naturally degrade **Naphthenic Acids (NAs)**—the primary toxic component of OSPW.

### Key Objectives

- **Enhance Efficacy:** Use genomic data to identify the most effective microbial communities for breaking down toxins.
    
- **Predictive Modeling:** Develop tools to predict how wetlands will perform in harsh Northern climates.
    
- **Responsible Innovation:** Ensure the science is socially, ethically, and economically sound (GE3LS framework).
    
- **Indigenous Collaboration:** Integrate Traditional Ecological Knowledge with natural sciences for restorative wetland design.

## 🛠 What They Are Doing (Research Pillars)

The project operates across five distinct "Activity" streams that bridge the gap between lab science and real-world application:

1. **Mesocosm Experiments:** Controlled, medium-scale tests to manipulate microbial communities and plant species.
    
2. **NA Degradation Studies:** Using DNA/RNA sequencing to pinpoint the exact genes responsible for detoxifying water.
    
3. **Wetland Experiments:** Real-world testing at pilot-scale sites (like the Kearl site) to validate lab findings.
    
4. **Performance Modeling:** Creating quantitative models to help industry design "optimal" wetlands based on local conditions.
    
5. **GE3LS (Social Science):** Conducting interviews, surveys, and "Experimental Decision Laboratories" to gauge community and legal acceptance of these technologies.

## 📦 Deliverables & Outcomes

What is GROW actually "handing over" to the world?

- **Genomic Toolkits:** qPCR assays and **NA-specific Biosensors** for rapid, low-cost water toxicity testing.
    
- **Best Practice Guidebooks:** Two key manuals:
    
    - _Indigenous Restorative CWTS Guidebook_
        
    - _Natural Sciences CWTS Guidebook_
        
- **Validated Treatment Strategy:** A "green" alternative to mechanical water treatment that regulators and industry can trust for long-term closure plans.
    
- **Arts-Based Communication:** Unique visual and narrative materials designed to bridge the gap between complex science and public understanding.
