# 📋 START HERE: March 5 Sprint Campaign
**Driving Attendance to Shawn Lewenza's Biosensor Presentation**

**Campaign Focus:** November 6, 2025 → **March 5, 2026** → April 2, 2026
**Primary Goal:** Maximize attendance and impact of March 5 biosensor presentation
**Created:** January 22, 2026

---

## 🎯 WHAT'S DIFFERENT: Sprint vs. Marathon Approach

### ORIGINAL PLAN ❌
22-week steady-state campaign promoting GROW research broadly

### **REVISED SPRINT PLAN** ✅
Build anticipation through Nov-Feb by attending and recapping seminars, then **PEAK on March 5** for Shawn Lewenza's biosensor presentation

**Why This Works Better:**
- Clear, measurable goal (March 5 attendance)
- Real content from attending actual presentations
- Natural momentum building (each seminar builds toward March 5)
- Authentic engagement (you're genuinely learning, not just promoting)
- Strong finale with your colleague presenting

## 💡 THE CORE STRATEGY IN ONE PARAGRAPH

You're attending the GROW seminar series and sharing valuable business-focused insights from each presentation with your LinkedIn network. Each recap subtly builds anticipation for March 5, when your colleague Dr. Shawn Lewenza presents biosensor technology that makes everything discussed operationally viable. By providing value through recaps (not just promoting), you build credibility and an engaged audience. When March 5 arrives, you've earned the right to ask them to attend—and they want to because you've shown them why it matters.
