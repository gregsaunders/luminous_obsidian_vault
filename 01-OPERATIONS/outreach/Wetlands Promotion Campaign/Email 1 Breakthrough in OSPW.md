## Email Body

**Hi [First Name],**

What if you could detect [[Naphthenic Acid]] (NAs) in oil sands process water in hours instead of weeks—at a fraction of the cost of [[HRMS]]?

That’s exactly what we’ve developed at [[Luminous BioSolutions]].

### From Tailings Pond Bacteria to Breakthrough Technology

Our Chief Science Officer, [[Dr. Shawn Lewenza]], isolated bacteria from Alberta tailings ponds and engineered them into precision biosensors that detect toxic naphthenic acids in real-time.

The results? Published in **[[ACS Synthetic Biology]]** (September 2024) and field-validated through the [[University of Calgary]] [[GROW Project]].

### The Numbers That Matter:
* **Detection limits:** 1.5–15 mg/L across different NA compound types
* **Real-world testing:** Validated on 24 real [[OSPW]] samples from active tailings ponds
* **Ease of use:** Minimal sample preparation (90 μL direct testing; no organic extraction required)
* **Speed:** Results in hours, not days

### Join Us at the GROW Seminar - March 5, 2026

[[Dr. Shawn Lewenza]] will present our biosensor technology and [[GROW Wetland Trial]] monitoring results at the University of Calgary’s GROW seminar series.

> [!event] Webinar Details
> 📅 **Date:** Wednesday, March 5, 2026
> ⏰ **Time:** [INSERT TIME]
> 📍 **Location:** Virtual ([INSERT REGISTRATION LINK])

**What You’ll Learn:**
* How we engineered three biosensor types ([[atuA]], [[marR]], [[3680]] promoters) to detect different NA compound classes
* Real data from constructed wetland trials
* How this changes the economics of [[OSPW]] monitoring
* Integration pathways with your existing operations

This isn’t theoretical lab work—this is proven technology ready for deployment.
