EMAIL BODY: 

Hi [First Name], What if you could detect naphthenic acids in oil sands process water in hours instead of weeks at a fraction of the cost of HRMS? That's exactly what we've developed at Luminous BioSolutions. 

**From Tailings Pond Bacteria to Breakthrough Technology** 
Our Chief Science Officer, Dr. Shawn Lewenza, isolated bacteria from Alberta tailings ponds and engineered them into precision biosensors that detect toxic naphthenic acids in real-time. The results? Published in ACS Synthetic Biology (September 2024) and field-validated through the University of Calgary's GROW project. 

**The Numbers That Matter:** 
- Detection limits: 1.5-15 mg/L across different NA compound types 
- Tested on 24 real OSPW samples from active tailings ponds 
- Minimal sample preparation (90 μL direct testing no organic extraction required) 
- Results in hours, not days 

**Join Us at the GROW Seminar - March 5, 2026** 
Dr. Lewenza will present our biosensor technology and GROW wetland monitoring results at the University of Calgary's GROW seminar series. 
📅 Date: Wednesday, March 5, 2026 
⏰ Time: [INSERT TIME] 
📍 Location: Virtual ([INSERT REGISTRATION LINK]) 

**What You'll Learn:** • How we engineered three biosensor types (atuA, marR, 3680 promoters) to detect different NA compound classes 
- Real data from constructed wetland trials 
- How this changes the economics of OSPW monitoring 
- Integration pathways with your existing operations 

This isn't theoretical lab work—this is proven technology ready for deployment.
