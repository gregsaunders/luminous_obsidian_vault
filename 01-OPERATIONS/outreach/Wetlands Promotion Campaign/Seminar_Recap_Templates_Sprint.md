## 📝 SPECIFIC SEMINAR RECAP EXAMPLES

### RECAP 1: Dr. Jason Ahad (Nov 6) - Analytical Chemistry Perspectives

**Post (Nov 7-8):**

Yesterday kicked off the GROW seminar series with Dr. Jason Ahad from Natural Resources Canada presenting on analytical approaches to understanding oil sands process-affected water. One stat that struck me: the sheer complexity of naphthenic acid (NA) compounds makes traditional detection methods both expensive and time-consuming. Here's why that matters for tailings remediation.

**Key Insight #1: Characterization is the Foundation**
Dr. Ahad detailed the analytical chemistry techniques used to characterize NAs in tailings ponds. Understanding exactly what compounds we're dealing with—their molecular structures, concentrations, and toxicity profiles—is essential before we can design effective treatment systems. You can't remediate what you can't accurately identify.

**Key Insight #2: Multiple Methods, Multiple Perspectives**
The presentation highlighted how different analytical techniques (mass spectrometry, spectroscopy, bioassays) each reveal different aspects of water quality. No single method tells the complete story, which is why integrated monitoring approaches matter.

**Business Perspective:**
From an operational standpoint, the reliance on sophisticated, lab-based analytical methods creates a bottleneck. When samples must be sent to specialized labs and results take days or weeks, operators can't make real-time adjustments to treatment systems. This is particularly challenging when you're trying to optimize biological systems like constructed wetlands, where conditions change rapidly.

The cost adds up quickly too—comprehensive analytical packages can run hundreds of dollars per sample. Multiply that across hundreds of sampling points over years of treatment, and monitoring becomes a significant operational expense.

**Why This Connects to March 5:**
This presentation underscores exactly why rapid, cost-effective biosensor monitoring (March 5 with Dr. Shawn Lewenza) is critical. While comprehensive lab analysis will always have a role in validation, having field-deployable biosensors that detect NAs in 24 hours enables the real-time optimization that wetland systems need.

What monitoring frequency do you think is necessary for optimizing wetland treatment systems?

### RECAP 2: Dr. Graham van Aggelen (Nov 12) - OSPW Characterization

**Post (Nov 13-14):**

Dr. Graham van Aggelen (Environment & Climate Change Canada) just presented compelling data on oil sands process-affected water characterization, and one point resonated strongly: the heterogeneity of tailings ponds means there's no "one size fits all" treatment approach. Here's what that means for implementation.

**Key Insight #1: Tailings Aren't Uniform**
Van Aggelen's research demonstrates significant variability in contaminant profiles across different ponds, depths, and even within the same pond over time. NA concentrations, speciation, and toxicity vary based on mining methods, ore processing, and age of tailings. This complexity demands adaptive treatment strategies.

**Key Insight #2: Bioavailability Matters More Than Total Concentration**
A fascinating finding: not all NAs present in water are equally bioavailable or toxic. Some are bound to particulates, some are transformed by early-stage degradation, and some are more readily taken up by biological systems. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for predicting treatment effectiveness.

**Business Perspective:**
This variability has major implications for wetland system design and operation. Cookie-cutter approaches won't work—each application needs to be tailored to the specific characteristics of the water being treated. But here's the challenge: how do you adapt treatment in real-time if you're relying on lab analysis with week-long turnaround times?

This is where monitoring frequency becomes operationally critical. If conditions are changing on a weekly basis, but your data is two weeks old by the time you receive it, you're always managing based on outdated information. The business case for rapid, on-site monitoring becomes compelling quickly.

**Why This Connects to March 5:**
Van Aggelen's work on characterizing what we're treating sets up the question: how do we track treatment progress efficiently? On March 5, Dr. Shawn Lewenza will present biosensor technology that provides 24-hour NA detection—enabling operators to adapt to the exact variability that van Aggelen's research identifies as critical.

How should operators balance comprehensive characterization with rapid operational monitoring?

Next GROW presentation: December 3, 11 AM MT - Dr. Lori Bradford (U. Saskatchewan) on social science perspectives

### RECAP 3: Dr. Lori Bradford (Dec 3) - Social Science Perspectives

**Post (Dec 4-5):**

Yesterday's GROW seminar shifted from lab science to social science, and Dr. Lori Bradford from the University of Saskatchewan delivered a crucial message: brilliant technology without social licence goes nowhere. Here's why the human dimension of tailings remediation matters as much as the science.

**Key Insight #1: Trust is Built Through Transparency**
Bradford's research highlights that communities—particularly Indigenous communities whose traditional lands are impacted—need to see transparent, credible monitoring data to trust that treatment systems are working. Claims of "effective treatment" without verifiable evidence create skepticism, not confidence.

**Key Insight #2: Co-Design Creates Better Outcomes**
The most successful remediation projects involve stakeholders from design through implementation. When Indigenous knowledge holders, local communities, and scientists collaborate on wetland design, the resulting systems are not only more ecologically appropriate but also have stronger social support.

**Business Perspective:**
From an industry standpoint, social licence isn't a "nice to have"—it's essential for project approval, ongoing operations, and ultimately, mine closure certification. Regulators increasingly require demonstrated community support before approving novel treatment approaches.

But building trust requires demonstrating effectiveness with credible data. This is where monitoring technology becomes more than just an operational tool—it becomes a trust-building instrument. When community members and regulators can see real-time data showing NA degradation in wetland systems, confidence grows.

**Why This Connects to March 5:**
Bradford's presentation underscores that monitoring isn't just about optimizing wetlands—it's about proving they work to stakeholders who need to trust the process. On March 5, Dr. Shawn Lewenza will present biosensor technology that's not only rapid and cost-effective, but also simple enough that community monitors could be trained to use it. That's how you build verifiable, transparent, trust-worthy monitoring systems.

How do you think communities should be involved in monitoring tailings treatment systems?

## ⏱️ COUNTDOWN POST TEMPLATES

### COUNTDOWN POST 1: One Month Out (Feb 5-7)

**"One Month Until Biosensor Breakthrough"**

30 days from now, the GROW seminar series will feature what I believe is one of the most operationally significant presentations in the entire series: Dr. Shawn Lewenza on biosensor technology for naphthenic acid detection.

After attending presentations on wetland engineering, microbial ecology, analytical chemistry, and social licence over the past three months, a pattern has emerged: **everyone needs better monitoring**.

Researchers need it to validate their treatment mechanisms. Engineers need it to optimize designs. Operators need it for real-time management. Regulators need it for compliance confidence. Communities need it for trust verification.

**Here's what makes biosensors game-changing:**

🔬 **Detection in 24 hours** (not weeks)
💰 **Fraction of traditional lab costs** (enables high-frequency sampling)
📍 **Field-deployable** (no need to ship samples to specialized labs)
📊 **Validated against mass spectrometry** (credible, not just convenient)
🎯 **Specific to NA subsets** (differentiate compound families)

On March 5, 11 AM MT, Dr. Lewenza will present how Luminous Bio Solutions' bacterial biosensors respond to naphthenic acids by producing luminescence proportional to concentration. It's elegant science that solves a practical problem: how do you monitor trillion-litre-scale wetland treatment systems without breaking the budget?

I've been following the GROW series specifically because this presentation represents a breakthrough in making wetland treatment operationally viable. The preceding presentations have built the scientific foundation. March 5 shows how we track and optimize it in practice.

Mark your calendars. This is the one you don't want to miss.

### COUNTDOWN POST 2: Two Weeks Out (Feb 19-21)

**"14 Days: Why Biosensor Monitoring Changes the Game"**

Two weeks from today, Dr. Shawn Lewenza presents biosensor technology that could fundamentally change how we monitor tailings remediation systems.

I just attended Dr. Frank Gobas' presentation on modeling wetland performance, and it reinforced something critical: models are only as good as the data you feed them. Predictive models can tell you what SHOULD happen in a wetland system. Monitoring tells you what IS happening.

The gap between prediction and reality is where operational success lives.

**The Current Monitoring Bottleneck:**

Traditional naphthenic acid analysis requires:
• Sophisticated lab equipment (mass spectrometry, HPLC)
• Specialized technicians
• Sample shipping and handling
• Days to weeks for results
• $200-500+ per comprehensive sample

When you're managing dynamic biological systems treating millions of litres, that bottleneck becomes operationally crippling. By the time you know something isn't working optimally, you've lost weeks of treatment capacity.

**What Biosensors Enable (March 5 Preview):**

Dr. Lewenza will demonstrate how engineered bacteria that detect NAs and produce light in response enable:
• 24-hour qualitative detection
• On-site field testing capability
• High-throughput screening (dozens of samples/day)
• Cost-effective enough for daily monitoring
• Validation of treatment system performance in near-real-time

This isn't replacing comprehensive lab analysis—it's filling the operational monitoring gap that makes day-to-day wetland management possible.

After four months of GROW presentations covering the science, engineering, and social dimensions of wetland treatment, March 5 is when we see how monitoring makes it all actionable.

**Final seats filling up. Register now: grow@ucalgary.ca**

March 5, 11 AM MT - Don't miss this one.

### COUNTDOWN POST 3: Final Reminder (March 3-4)

**"48 Hours: The Monitoring Breakthrough You've Been Waiting For"**

In 48 hours, Dr. Shawn Lewenza presents biosensor technology for rapid naphthenic acid detection at the GROW seminar series.

If you've been following my coverage of these seminars since November, you know I've been building to this moment. We've covered the genomics, the engineering, the social licence, the analytical methods, the biodegradation mechanisms—all the foundational science of how constructed wetlands can remediate oil sands tailings.

March 5 is when we see how to monitor it effectively.

**What You'll Learn Thursday (11 AM MT):**

✅ How bacterial biosensors directly sense naphthenic acids
✅ The luminescence mechanism that enables quantification
✅ Validation data from real constructed wetland systems
✅ Field deployment capabilities and protocols
✅ Cost and time comparisons vs. traditional methods
✅ How this enables adaptive wetland management

**Why This Matters:**

You can engineer the perfect wetland system, stock it with ideal microbial communities, and design it according to the best genomic insights—but if you can't track performance in real-time, you're flying blind operationally.

This presentation shows how monitoring becomes feasible at the scale and frequency that trillion-litre tailings remediation actually requires.

I'll be there. The GROW researchers will be there. Industry operators, regulators, academics, and consultants will be there.

Will you?
