## Risk Management

### Potential Challenges
1. **Skepticism about wetlands at scale** - Address with cost data and pilot results
2. **Regulatory uncertainty** - Acknowledge pathway challenges, emphasize monitoring capability
3. **Competition from other technologies** - Position as complementary, not exclusive
4. **Indigenous consultation concerns** - Emphasize social licence pillar of GROW research
5. **Timeline expectations** - Be realistic about long-term nature of remediation

### Communication Guidelines
- **Never overstate** - Use "promising," "potential," "pilot results suggest" rather than definitive claims
- **Always attribute** - Credit GROW researchers, cite data sources
- **Stay business-focused** - You're providing business perspective, not speaking for researchers
- **Acknowledge complexity** - Don't oversimplify the science or challenges
- **Invite dialogue** - Position as learning and collaborating, not preaching
