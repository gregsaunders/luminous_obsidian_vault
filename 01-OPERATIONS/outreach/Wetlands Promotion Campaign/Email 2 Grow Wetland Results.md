## Email Body

**Hi [First Name],**

Last week I told you about our [[Naphthenic Acid]] biosensor technology. This week, I want to share what happened when we actually put it to the test.

### The Real-World Challenge

Working with the [[University of Calgary]]’s [[GROW Project]] (Genomics Research for Optimizing Constructed Treatment Wetlands), we faced a critical question:

*Could bacterial biosensors actually replace expensive [[Mass Spectrometry]] for monitoring naphthenic acids in oil sands process water?*

### What We Did

[[Dr. Shawn Lewenza]] and our team tested our biosensor panel on:
* **24 [[OSPW]] samples** from Alberta tailings ponds
* [[NAFC]] extracts (naphthenic acid fraction compounds)
* Direct water samples with minimal dilution

We used three different biosensor types, each engineered to detect different classes of NA compounds:

1.  **[[atuA]]** (Acyclic NAs / straight chain carboxylic acids)
2.  **[[marR]]** (Complex/aromatic NAs and fusaric acid)
3.  **[[3680]]** (Simple cyclic NAs)

### The Results That Surprised Us

* ✅ **Detection in 22 of 24 raw water samples** using just two biosensors
* ✅ **Sensitivity down to 1.5 mg/L** for the custom 9xNA mixture
* ✅ **Compound-specific fingerprinting** (distinguishing between acyclic vs. aromatic)
* ✅ **Dose-dependent responses** (reliable quantification, not just yes/no detection)

### Why This Matters for Your Operations

Traditional [[HRMS]]/[[Orbitrap]] analysis is expensive, slow, and requires extensive sample prep. Our biosensors:

* **Cost a fraction** of mass spectrometry
* **Deliver results in hours**, enabling real-time decision-making
* **Work with minimal sample preparation**
* **Provide NA compound class information** (not just total concentration)

### See the Data Yourself - March 5th GROW Presentation

[[Dr. Shawn Lewenza]] will walk through the complete [[GROW Wetland Trial]] results, including:
* Detection limit curves for all biosensor types
* Head-to-head comparisons with [[HRMS]] data
* Real-world operational scenarios
* Q&A on implementation in your facilities
