- Questions you hope they'll address
- (Do this for Shawn in late February - builds his credibility)

**4. "Myth vs. Reality" Posts**
"Myth: Constructed wetlands are too slow for industrial timelines"
"Reality: What I'm learning from GROW research..."
- Educational angle
- Addresses skepticism
- Positions you as informed source

**5. Poll Posts**
"What's the biggest barrier to wetland treatment adoption?"

## 🎤 Draft Post: Campaign Introduction (Nov 6-7)

### LinkedIn Post - Introduction

Starting today, I'm following something that could fundamentally change how we address Alberta's 1.4 trillion litres of oil sands tailings.

The University of Calgary's GROW project (Genomics Research for Optimization of Constructed Treatment Wetlands) is hosting a 5-month seminar series featuring breakthrough research on using engineered wetlands to remediate tailings water. This isn't theoretical—they're working with real systems, real data, and real pathways to treatment.

I'm Jeff, and through Luminous Bio Solutions, we've developed bacterial biosensor technology that rapidly detects naphthenic acids—the toxic compounds preventing water release from tailings ponds. I'll be attending these seminars and sharing insights from a business perspective: What makes this operationally viable? How do we achieve regulatory approval? What does the path to implementation look like?

Today's presentation by Dr. Jason Ahad (Natural Resources Canada) kicked off the series with analytical chemistry perspectives. I'll be recapping key insights throughout this series, but I'm particularly focused on March 5, when Dr. Shawn Lewenza—Luminous Bio Solutions' Chief Science Officer—presents our biosensor monitoring technology.

**Here's why rapid NA detection matters:** You can't optimize what you can't measure quickly. Traditional analytical methods take weeks and cost hundreds per sample. Our biosensors detect NAs in 24 hours at a fraction of the cost—enabling real-time wetland management at the scale these ponds demand.

Over the next 4 months, these presentations will build the scientific foundation. On March 5, we'll show how monitoring makes it actionable.

If you're in oil sands operations, environmental regulation, or remediation consulting, this series is worth your time. Next presentation: November 12 with Dr. Graham van Aggelen (Environment Canada) on OSPW characterization.

## 💡 Final Thoughts on Sprint Approach

### Why This Works Better

**1. Clear Goal:** Drive March 5 attendance (measurable, achievable)

**2. Natural Content Flow:** Real presentations give you real content to react to

**3. Credibility Building:** Attending and recapping 8-10 presentations before your own builds expertise perception

**4. Momentum:** Each post builds anticipation rather than being standalone

**5. Authenticity:** You're genuinely engaged with the research, not just promoting

**6. Value-First:** You're providing seminar insights to your audience before asking them to attend yours

### Success Indicators for Sprint

By March 5, you'll know this worked if:
- ✅ Your recap posts consistently get 20+ engaged comments
- ✅ People tag colleagues saying "you should attend March 5"
- ✅ Shawn's presentation has strong attendance (50-100+ people)
- ✅ You've had 10+ substantive conversations about biosensor applications
- ✅ Other GROW researchers acknowledge your promotional support
- ✅ You're seen as a credible voice in tailings remediation space

## 🔄 How This Integrates with Original Strategy

**What Stays the Same:**
- Target audiences (operators, regulators, academics, consultants)
- Tone (optimistic thought leader)
- Business perspective positioning
- Email + LinkedIn integration
- Visual content strategy
- Engagement approach

**What Changes:**
- Timing: Sprint to March 5, then reassess
- Content trigger: Seminar recaps drive posting schedule (not arbitrary weekly themes)
- Primary CTA: Register for/attend March 5 (not generic "let's collaborate")
- Intensity: Higher frequency in Feb, lighter in Nov-Dec
- Success metric: March 5 attendance and post-event leads (not generic engagement)

**Original Package Still Useful:**
- Implementation guide workflows and tools
- Email templates (adjust messaging)
- AI visual prompts (still generate these)
- Engagement strategies (apply to recap posts)
- Metrics tracking (same approach)

---

**This sprint strategy positions March 5 as the crescendo of 4 months of building expertise and anticipation. Let's make Shawn's presentation the must-attend event for anyone serious about tailings remediation monitoring! 🚀**
