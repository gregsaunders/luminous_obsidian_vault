- Technology integration vision

**Your unique value:** You understand both the biology (biosensors) and the business (Luminous Bio Solutions), giving you credibility to comment from a commercial lens while respecting the science.

**Tone:** Optimistic thought leader - enthusiastic about breakthroughs while acknowledging challenges. Forward-thinking but credible. Inviting dialogue, not preaching solutions.
