## **EXECUTIVE BRIEF: De-Risking the $20B ARO Through Information Fidelity**

**The Financial Reality:** Suncor and CNRL carry **$20B in combined ARO liability** and **$958M in annual accretion expense**. Auditors flag these as **"Critical Audit Matters"** because they rely on professional judgment rather than empirical data.

### **Our Value Proposition**

We provide **Independent Trust Infrastructure** that converts subjective closure assumptions into defensible financial documentation.

|**Operational ROI**|**Financial Certainty**|**Regulatory Unlock**|
|---|---|---|
|**Optimized Treatment:** High-frequency feedback (hours, not weeks) reduces pilot iteration cycles.|**Accretion Management:** 1-year closure timeline reduction can recover **$45M–$50M in PV** per operator.|**Bill C-59 Compliance:** Independent third-party verification for environmental claims.|

### **Why Luminous BioSolutions?**

- **Alberta-Native Provenance:** Sensors isolated from bacteria native to Alberta tailings ponds validated at the **Kearl GROW Pilot**.
    
- **Frictionless Logistical Model:** **Off-site laboratory testing** means no site-access permits, no safety orientations, and zero operational disruption.
    
- **Immutable Trust:** Data is housed in a **timestamped graph database (RCE)**, providing a third-party "System of Record" for regulators and Indigenous partners.
    
### **The "Low-Cost Option" Pilot**

A small investment generates the data needed to test "Information Value". The goal is to determine if high-fidelity monitoring can "collapse" the uncertainty premium currently bloating your long-dated liabilities.
