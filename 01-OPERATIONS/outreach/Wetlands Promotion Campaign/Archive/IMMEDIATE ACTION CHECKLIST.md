## 🔴 BLOCKING ISSUE (Resolve First)

### Financial Data Extraction - URGENT
**Why This Blocks Everything:** Cannot finalize Email 1-2 financial messaging without exact ARO numbers

**What You Need to Extract (Text Only, Not Full PDFs):**

#### From Suncor 2024 Annual Report:
- [ ] Total ARO liability amount ($ billions)
- [ ] Annual accretion expense ($ millions)
- [ ] Discount rate used for ARO calculation (%)
- [ ] Any language in Risk Factors mentioning "monitoring," "data uncertainty," or "closure timeline assumptions"

#### From CNRL 2024 Annual Report:
- [ ] Total ARO liability amount ($ billions)
- [ ] Annual accretion expense ($ millions)
- [ ] Discount rate used for ARO calculation (%)
- [ ] Any language in Risk Factors mentioning similar topics

**How to Extract (Avoiding PDF Issues):**
1. Open annual reports in Adobe Reader or browser
2. Search for "Asset Retirement Obligation" or "ARO"
3. Find the Financial Statements section (usually Note 12 or similar)
4. Copy just the ARO table and surrounding paragraphs into a text file
5. Share that text extract with me

**Once I Have This Data:**
- I can insert exact figures into all email drafts
- Calculate "1-year closure reduction = $X million" impact statements
- Make CFO messaging bulletproof with real numbers
