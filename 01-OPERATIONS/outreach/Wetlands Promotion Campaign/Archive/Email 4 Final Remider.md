## Email Body

**Hi [First Name],**

This is your final reminder—**[[Dr. Shawn Lewenza]] presents our naphthenic acid biosensor technology this Wednesday, March 5th** at the [[University of Calgary]] [[GROW Project]] seminar.

If you’ve been following our campaign over the past three weeks, you’ve heard about:
* **The Technology:** Bacterial biosensors engineered from tailings pond bacteria
* **The Results:** Validated on 24 real [[OSPW]] samples with detection limits of 1.5–15 mg/L
* **The Intelligence Platform:** [[Relational Context Engine]] for predictive monitoring

Now it’s time to see it all come together.

### About Dr. Shawn Lewenza

Dr. Lewenza is [[Luminous BioSolutions]]' Chief Science Officer and the lead scientist behind our biosensor technology. His background:

* Professor at [[Athabasca University]] & [[University of Calgary]]
* Published researcher in microbiology and synthetic biology (**[[ACS Synthetic Biology]]**, 2024)
* Collaborated on the University of Calgary GROW project testing biosensors in constructed wetlands
* 20+ years of experience in **[[Pseudomonas]]** genetics and environmental microbiology

He’s not just a researcher—he’s the scientist who isolated bacteria from Alberta tailings ponds and engineered them into precision analytical tools.

### What You'll Learn Wednesday:

* 🔬 **The Science:** How we identified NA-inducible genes and built biosensor constructs
* 📊 **The Data:** Complete [[GROW Wetland Trial]] results—no marketing spin, just data
* 🏭 **The Application:** How this integrates into oil sands operations
* 💰 **The Economics:** Cost comparison vs. traditional monitoring methods
* 🤝 **Q&A:** Your questions answered directly by Dr. Lewenza

> 📅 **Date:** Wednesday, March 5, 2026
> ⏰ **Time:** [TIME]
> 🔗 **Action:** [REGISTRATION LINK]

### This is Your Last Chance to Register

Seating is limited (virtual capacity constraints), and we've had strong interest from:
* **Oil sands operators:** [[Imperial]], [[Suncor]], [[CNRL]], [[Cenovus]]
* **Environmental consultants** and engineering firms
* **Academic researchers** from across Canada
* **Regulatory bodies:** [[AER]], [[ECCC]]

Don’t miss the opportunity to see breakthrough technology that could transform how you monitor [[OSPW]].

**[REGISTER NOW - FINAL CALL]**

We’re looking forward to seeing you there.
