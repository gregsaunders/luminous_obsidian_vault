- Include lighting direction and time of day
- Reference specific visual styles (documentary, cinematic, educational)
- Keep prompts under 150 words for best results
- Specify frame rate preference if needed (24fps cinematic, 30fps standard)

### For Google Imagen (Images):
- Be specific about layout and composition
- Specify infographic vs photorealistic vs illustration style
- Include color palette preferences
- Reference similar visual styles (corporate, scientific, documentary)
- Mention aspect ratio if needed (16:9 for presentations, 1:1 for social)

### General Best Practices:
- **Consistency:** Use similar style descriptors across related visuals
- **Credibility:** Emphasize professional, scientific, documentary aesthetics
- **Accuracy:** For scientific content, specify "accurate representation" of molecular structures, etc.
- **Emotional tone:** Include descriptors like "hopeful," "serious," "inspiring" as appropriate
- **Quality:** Always specify "4K," "professional," "high quality" for polished results
