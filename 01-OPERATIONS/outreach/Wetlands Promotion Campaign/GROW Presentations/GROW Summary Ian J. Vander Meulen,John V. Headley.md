### **Executive Summary**

The presentation details the performance of "constructed treatment wetlands" for remediating Oil Sands Process-Affected Water (OSPW). The core finding is that these wetlands effectively reduce the toxicity of Naphthenic Acid Fraction Compounds (NAFCs) much faster than they reduce the total mass of the compounds. By Day 42 of treatment, aquatic toxicity (to fathead minnows) was effectively eliminated, even though total NAFC concentrations remained relatively high (~50 mg/L)11. This suggests the wetlands preferentially remove the most toxic, hydrophobic "bad actors" first.

### **1. Mesocosm (Lab-Scale) Findings**

The team started with greenhouse experiments to isolate variables like plant presence and temperature.

- **Plants vs. Microbes:** While unplanted systems showed some degradation (proving the role of bacterial biofilms), planted systems (specifically _C. aquatilis_) showed the greatest decreases in NAFCs over time2.
    
- **The "Temperature Spike":** A distinct spike in NAFC concentration was observed in warmer temperature regimes ($20^{\circ}C$ Day / $10^{\circ}C$ Night) by Day 163. The speaker hypothesized this might be a "soap-like" effect where higher temps mobilize/desorb NAFCs from the soil, though mass balance studies were inconclusive.
    
- **Chemical Trends:** Across all setups, there was a consistent decrease in $O_2$ formula classes (classic Naphthenic Acids) and an increase in oxidized species ($O_3$, $O_4$, $O_5$)4444.
    

### **2. Field Scale: The Kearl Treatment Wetland**

The pilot wetland is a semi-passive system designed with a 14-day recirculation rate (approx. 6 L/s flow)55.

#### **2021 Season: The "Baseline" Year**

- **Operational Issue:** Pumps shut down at Day 45 due to low water levels caused by evapotranspiration (ET)6.
    
- **Findings:** Despite the water loss (which usually concentrates chemicals), the NAFC concentrations remained steady (42–47 mg/L). This indicated that degradation was occurring at a rate roughly equal to the water loss7.
    
- **Chemical Insight:** There was an effective 10–12% decrease in "classic" NAs ($O_2$) that was masked by the steady total concentration8.
    

#### **2022 Season: Degradation Rates**

This season provided the most robust kinetic data, corrected for evapotranspiration using Chloride (Cl-) normalization9.

- **Degradation Rates:** The slides provide the exact linear regression rates for NAFC removal:
    
    - **Day 0–15 (Period 1):** Rapid removal at **-0.532 mg/L/day** ($R^2 = 0.43$)10.
        
    - **Day 30–70 (Period 2):** Slowed removal at **-0.248 mg/L/day** ($R^2 = 0.50$)11.
        
- **Chemical "Arch":** Principal Component Analysis (PCA) showed a consistent chronological separation of chemical profiles from Day 0 to Day 98 across all wetland cells12.
    
- **Selective Removal:** The system selectively removed the highest carbon number formulae (C15–C19) and those with Double Bond Equivalents (DBE) of 6–8 (likely aromatic structures)13.
    

#### **2024 Season: The "Flow" Anomaly**

- **Degradation:** Trends continued with rates of ~0.3 mg/L/day (Day 0–42) and ~0.15 mg/L/day (Day 45–128)1414.
    
- **Shallow Area 5 (SA5):** The transcript mentioned this area "doing its own thing." The map on Slide 24 and data on Slide 153 reveal why: SA5 is physically parallel to SA3 and SA4. Sedimentation likely isolated this channel, creating preferential flow pathways that bypassed SA5, resulting in stagnant treatment data for that specific cell15151515.

### **3. The "Juicy" Findings: Toxicity vs. Chemistry (2024)**

The most significant finding came from the toxicity assays on _Pimephales promelas_ (fathead minnow) embryos16.

- **Survival Rates:**
    
    - **Day 0:** High toxicity (<5% survival in some samples).
        
    - **Day 14:** ~50% survival (LC50 equivalent).
        
    - **Day 42:** Survival matched the control groups (>90%)17.
        
- **Adverse Outcomes:** Severe deformities in fish dropped from ~90% at Day 0 to near-zero by Day 28–4218.
    

#### **The Concentration Paradox**

There is a mismatch between the chemical concentration and the biological toxicity:

- **The Paradox:** At Day 42, the water was non-toxic, yet the total NAFC concentration was still **~50 mg/L**19.
    
- **Standard Literature:** Usually, fathead minnows die at much lower concentrations (LC50 range: 18–34 mg/L)2020.
    
- **Model Discrepancy:** The team used the "Hughes Model" (a structure-toxicity predictive model) which predicts toxicity based on carbon chain length. The empirical data showed the water was **2.6x less toxic** than the model predicted for that concentration2121.
    
- **Explanation:** The wetland is selectively removing the "worst" compounds first—specifically the high-carbon, lipophilic (fat-soluble) $O_2$-NAFCs that act as surfactants and disrupt cell membranes (narcosis)22222222. The remaining 50 mg/L consists of oxidized, less bioavailable compounds ($O_3, O_4$) that do not kill the fish.
    

### **4. Conclusions & Future Work**

- **Efficacy:** Constructed wetlands work at both lab and pilot scales, consistently reducing $O_2$ NAFCs and shifting the chemical profile toward lower molecular weight, oxidized forms23.
    
- **Plants:** Vegetation improves outcomes, likely through direct uptake of aliphatic compounds and by providing surface area for microbial biofilms24.
    
- **Design Note:** Future designs must account for sedimentation to prevent flow isolation (as seen in Shallow Area 5).
    
- **Main Takeaway:** Toxicity decreases much faster than the total chemical concentration implies. Regulatory parameters might need to look beyond simple "Total NAFC" concentration numbers to understand true environmental safety25.
