# CNRL Albian: Pilot Strategy (Q2 2026)

**Goal:** Secure Q2 2026 Commercial Pilot.
**Status:** Post-CDL Re-Engagement.

## The "Hook"
Leverage CDL Mentor feedback to pivot the conversation from "Environmental Monitoring" (Cost Center) to "**Operational Intelligence**" (Efficiency/Savings).

## Draft Email: Post-CDL Update

**Subject:** CDL Update: Operational Intelligence (Q2 2026 Pilot)

Hi [Name],

I wanted to give you a quick update following our CDL session. The feedback from the mentors (including Ops VPs) was direct: **"Stop selling environmental monitoring. Sell operational speed."**

They highlighted that the real pain isn't just compliance—it's the **8-week decision lag**. You're managing billion-dollar water release strategies, but the toxicity data takes 2 months to arrive. You can't steer a process you can't measure in real-time.

**The Pivot:**
We are shifting our entire focus to **Operational Intelligence**.
*   **The Sensor:** Cuts feedback from 8 weeks to 48 hours (The "Fuel Gauge").
*   **The Engine:** Correlates toxicity with SCADA/Weather to answer *why* it spiked.
*   **The Value:** We validated **$260k/year** in efficiencies at Kearl (flow optimization, extended seasons) just by closing that time gap.

**The Proposal (Q2 2026):**
We are selecting 2 operators for our Q2 2026 Commercial Pilot to build their **2027 Regulatory Baseline**.
*   **Investment:** Cost Recovery Only (Zero Profit Margin).
*   **Funding:** 50% Grant Matching (ERA/Alberta Innovates) is lined up.
*   **Deployment:** Zero IT integration (Offsite lab model).

I'd like to discuss how we can slot Albian into one of these Q2 spots. Do you have 15 mins this week to review the updated scope?

Best,
Jeff
