# CNRL Albian: Pilot Strategy (2026)

**Goal:** Secure Commercial Pilot for 2026 (Ice Melt to End of Year).
**Status:** Post-CDL Re-Engagement.

## The "Hook"
Leverage CDL Mentor feedback (specifically **Steve Laut's** insights) to pivot the conversation from "Environmental Monitoring" (Cost Center) to "**Operational Intelligence**" (Efficiency/Savings).

## Meeting Strategy
We need to set up two separate meetings to drive this new narrative.

### Meeting 1: Theo & Jayne (Follow-up)
*   **Purpose:** Follow up on the last meeting and provide an update on CDL Day.
*   **Key Talking Point:** Share Steve Laut's comments about operational value.
*   **Goal:** Get them thinking about the operational value our solution delivers, moving beyond just compliance.

### Meeting 2: Jean Paul (CDL Follow-up)
*   **Purpose:** Separate follow-up specifically regarding CDL Day.
*   **Key Talking Point:** Discuss the broader industry feedback and the shift to operational intelligence.
*   **Goal:** Align Jean Paul with the new strategic direction before the pilot proposal.

## The Pilot Strategy (2026)
**Timeline:** Start when the ice melts in 2026 -> Run through to the end of 2026.

**The Narrative:**
*   **Operational Intelligence:** We are not just monitoring; we are providing data to optimize operations.
*   **The Gap:** Closing the 8-week decision lag to <48 hours.
*   **The Value:** Efficiency, cost savings, and risk reduction (as validated at Kearl).

## Draft Email: Post-CDL Update (General Template)

**Subject:** CDL Update: Operational Intelligence (2026 Pilot Strategy)

Hi [Name],

I wanted to give you a quick update following our CDL session. The feedback from the mentors (including Steve Laut) was direct: **"Stop selling environmental monitoring. Sell operational speed."**

They highlighted that the real pain isn't just compliance—it's the **8-week decision lag**. You're managing billion-dollar water release strategies, but the toxicity data takes 2 months to arrive. You can't steer a process you can't measure in real-time.

**The Pivot:**
We are shifting our entire focus to **Operational Intelligence**.
*   **The Sensor:** Cuts feedback from 8 weeks to 48 hours (The "Fuel Gauge").
*   **The Engine:** Correlates toxicity with SCADA/Weather to answer *why* it spiked.

**The Proposal (2026):**
We are planning a commercial pilot for the **2026 season (Ice Melt to End of Year)** to build the 2027 Regulatory Baseline.
*   **Investment:** Cost Recovery Only (Zero Profit Margin).
*   **Funding:** 50% Grant Matching (ERA/Alberta Innovates) is lined up.
*   **Deployment:** Zero IT integration (Offsite lab model).

I'd like to discuss how we can slot Albian into this 2026 program. Do you have 15 mins this week to review the updated scope?

Best,
Jeff

**Subject:** Follow-up: Steve Laut's Feedback & Operational Intelligence

Hi Theo & Jayne,

Hope you're having a good week.

Following up on our last chat—we just finished our session at CDL, and the feedback from the mentors (specifically **Steve Laut**) was a bit of a lightbulb moment for us.

Steve was very clear: **"Don't sell environmental monitoring. Sell operational speed."**

He pointed out that the **8-week lag** in toxicity data is an operational bottleneck. You can't optimize what you can't measure in real-time.

We're pivoting our pilot strategy for **2026 (Ice Melt to Winter)** to focus entirely on this "**Operational Intelligence**"—giving you the data in 48 hours so you can actually make decisions.

I'd love to grab 15 mins to share this update and see if it aligns with what you're seeing at Albian.

Best,
Jeff

## Draft Email: Jean Paul (CDL Follow-up)

**Subject:** CDL Update: 2026 Pilot Strategy

Hi Jean Paul,

I wanted to reach out separately to give you a quick update post-CDL.

We received some pointed feedback from the industry mentors (including **Steve Laut**) about shifting our focus from "compliance" to "**operational efficiency**".

The core value prop is closing the gap between water release decisions and toxicity data (from **8 weeks to 48 hours**).

We are structuring our **2026 Pilot** around this new "Operational Intelligence" model.

Do you have time for a quick chat to discuss how this might fit with your 2026 planning?

Best,
Jeff
