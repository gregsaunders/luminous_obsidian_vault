Below is a **high-level review** of the notes, the group chat, and the **new context** regarding Athabasca University (AU) owning the patent rights initially. It also incorporates the plan for **Lewenza Labs** to potentially acquire the IP in the future. Finally, it provides an assessment of whether we have enough to draft an **agreement in principle**, along with recommended next steps.

---

## 1. Overall Observations

1. **Patent Owned by Athabasca University (AU)**  
   - Currently, **AU holds the patent** (or at least pending patent application rights).  
   - **Shawn** is the named inventor due to his role as a professor; the research lab remains at AU.  
   - The group envisions **Luminous** initially negotiating a **license** directly with AU, giving Luminous the right to commercialize.

2. **Future Transfer of IP**  
   - Once the patent is granted (or near granted), **Shawn** could form **Lewenza Labs** and **negotiate a transfer** of the IP from AU to Lewenza Labs.  
   - This means that for a transitional period, the patent **remains at AU** while Luminous commercializes under a **university license**.  
   - When the time is right, the IP can be **moved** from AU to Lewenza Labs, presumably with compensation or terms to be determined.

3. **Two-Company vs. One-Company**  
   - **Greg** and **Jeff** still lean toward two entities—Lewenza Labs (IP) and Luminous Bio Solutions (commercial).  
   - **Shawn** wants to ensure the IP is protected, but also not overcomplicate things prematurely.  
   - Given that the IP is **not yet** under Shawn’s direct control, forming **Lewenza Labs** can be **phased in** once the transfer is imminent.

4. **Voting Control & Governance**  

• **Lewenza Labs (Future IP Entity)**  
  - If and when Lewenza Labs is formed (i.e., once the patent is ready for transfer from AU), **Shawn** will initially own **100%** of the shares (including voting rights).  
  - **Greg** and **Jeff** may be granted **options** to purchase equity in Lewenza Labs at a future date, potentially allowing them to share in any economic upside without affecting Shawn’s voting control.

• **Luminous (Current/Commercial Entity)**  
  - **Shawn** holds **all voting shares** in Luminous, giving him ultimate decision-making authority on major corporate actions.  
  - **Greg** and **Jeff** each receive **common, non-voting shares** in Luminous, ensuring they participate equally with Shawn in the **economic value** (dividends, retained earnings, share appreciation) without altering Shawn’s voting control.  
  - In this scenario, all three parties share **economic benefits** on an equal basis, but Shawn retains a **tiebreaker** or final say in governance matters.

	This approach achieves the following:
	
	1. **Protects Shawn’s IP interests** and maintains his ultimate decision-making authority in both entities, which aligns with the role of inventor and primary researcher.  
	2. **Allows Greg and Jeff** to invest their time, skills, and resources into commercial operations, and still **share in the upside** without threatening Shawn’s voting control.  
	3. **Keeps governance simple** by separating **voting power** from **economic participation**, which may prove advantageous if disagreements arise or if the company seeks outside investment later.


5. **Equity & Share Classes**  
- **Lewenza Labs (Future IP Entity):**  
  - Shawn will initially own **100%** of the shares (including all voting rights).  
  - Greg and Jeff may receive **options** to purchase equity at a later date, allowing them to participate in Lewenza Labs’ economic upside without changing Shawn’s voting majority.

- **Luminous (Commercial Entity):**  
  - Shawn holds **all voting shares**, thereby retaining final decision-making authority.  
  - Greg and Jeff each hold **non-voting common shares**, ensuring **equal economic participation** in the company’s value (e.g., dividends, retained earnings, share appreciation).  
  - While Greg and Jeff do not have voting power in Luminous, they remain actively involved in day-to-day operations and strategic decisions by virtue of their roles (operations, sales/marketing).

This arrangement balances **Shawn’s desire for IP and voting control** with **Greg and Jeff’s interest** in capturing the company’s economic benefits. It also keeps clear lines between **voting shares** (held by Shawn) and **non-voting shares** (held by Jeff and Greg, in equal proportions to voting shares if so desired for economic splitting), aligning with the group’s priorities.


6. **Licensing Strategy**  
   - In the **near term**, Luminous negotiates an **exclusive license** with AU, letting Luminous proceed to market.  
   - In the **longer term**, once the IP is officially transferred from AU to **Lewenza Labs**, Luminous transitions to a **license** or **royalty arrangement** with Lewenza Labs.  
   - This phased approach avoids setting up Lewenza Labs too soon, since **AU** is the current IP owner.

7. **Funding & Capital Contributions**  
   - Everyone still anticipates a small **initial cash contribution** (e.g., \$? each for Luminous).  
   - **No large outlay** is expected for R&D since Shawn’s academic lab at AU covers much of the early research cost.  
   - When Lewenza Labs eventually acquires the patent from AU, the **value** of the IP (and any payment terms) will need to be recognized.

8. **Group Chat Insights**  
   - Shawn finds the overall legal structure **overwhelming** but sees the importance of hashing out details.  
   - Jeff wants to **keep things simple** initially, quickly test market assumptions, and only finalize more complex arrangements once there’s real traction.  
   - Greg echoes the preference for **two entities** but prefers a phased implementation.

## 2. Do You Have Enough for an Agreement in Principle?

### Short Answer: Yes

We appear to have **sufficient alignment** on these core points:

1. **IP Roadmap**  
   - In the **short term**, Luminous licenses IP directly from AU.  
   - In the **long term**, IP transfers to Lewenza Labs (owned by Shawn in voting shares, with Greg/Jeff potentially holding non-voting shares or options).

2. **Two-Entity Vision**  
   - Lewenza Labs eventually becomes the **IP holder** once AU transfers the patent.  
   - Luminous handles **commercialization**, with Greg, Jeff, and Shawn as **co-owners** (likely 33.3% each) and a **licensing agreement** from Lewenza Labs when the time comes.

3. **Shawn’s Voting Control**  
   - **Lewenza Labs:** Shawn will own all voting shares (initially 100% ownership). Greg and Jeff may later acquire non-voting equity or options without affecting Shawn’s majority vote.  
   - **Luminous:** Shawn likewise holds all voting shares, retaining final decision-making authority. Greg and Jeff receive non-voting common shares that grant equal economic rights, ensuring they can actively drive business decisions in their operational roles while Shawn retains ultimate voting control.

4. **Initial Funding & Roles**  
   - Each founder contributes **roughly equal startup cash** to Luminous; Shawn’s **academic lab** covers R&D until the IP is formally moved.  
   - **No immediate** large personal R&D investment needed from Shawn, Greg, or Jeff.

5. **Keeping It Simple at First**  
   - The group is open to a **phased** approach: start with Luminous + an AU license, then form Lewenza Labs once the patent is near final.  
   - You can codify that in an “agreement in principle,” ensuring everyone understands the eventual goal of a **two-company** structure.

## 3. Recommended Next Steps

1. **Draft a Short “Agreement in Principle”**  
   - Clearly reference the **AU licensing step** as the immediate approach (i.e., Luminous obtains a license from AU).  
   - Outline that once the patent is near completion, **Lewenza Labs** will be formed or activated, and the IP will be **transferred** from AU to Lewenza Labs, with Shawn holding **majority voting**.

2. **Define the Share & Voting Structures**  
   - **Lewenza Labs** (future IP holder):  
     - Shawn: voting shares (majority or 100%).  
     - Greg & Jeff: non-voting shares or options, if they want economic participation in the IP.  
   - **Luminous** (commercial entity):  
     - Shawn, Greg, Jeff each hold 33.3% (or a similar split).  
     - Shawn to have a voting share class, Jeff and Greg non-voting.

3. **Establish a “Phase-In” Timeline**  
   - Phase 1: **Luminous + AU License** to test the market and sign initial customers.  
   - Phase 2: **Form Lewenza Labs** once the patent is granted or near granted.  
   - Phase 3: **Finalize an exclusive license** from Lewenza Labs to Luminous, replacing the AU license.

4. **Detail Governance & Dispute Resolution**  
   - For Luminous, specify how major decisions (e.g., raising capital, changing the licensing terms) are approved.  
   - Add a **mediation clause** for disputes.  
   - Outline how “inactive partners” or “buyout” scenarios are handled, even if only in broad strokes for now.

5. **Seek Light Legal Review**  
   - Consider a quick consult with an attorney familiar with **university-owned IP transfers** to ensure your plan for acquiring the patent from AU is realistic.  
   - This is especially important if the university wants to keep any **royalty rights** or imposes conditions on licensing.

## 4. Conclusion

Given the group’s discussions, **new AU context**, and the desire to keep things **simple** while still protecting Shawn’s invention, you appear to have **enough clarity** to:

- Draft a **basic founders’ agreement** or “agreement in principle” that spells out the **short-term licensing arrangement** with AU, the plan to **form Lewenza Labs** down the road, and the intended **equity/voting** structure in each entity.  
- Formally recognize that **Shawn** holds all **voting shares** of Lewenza Labs (once established) and Greg/Jeff may have **non-voting** or **option** shares if they wish to participate economically in the IP.  
- In **Luminous**, you all share an equal stake, with clear roles for Greg (operations/tech) and Jeff (sales/marketing).  
- Include a **timeline** or **trigger event** (e.g., the patent is nearly granted) for when Lewenza Labs will be created, and how it will **license** IP to Luminous.  

That level of structure allows you to **start talking to customers** (as Jeff wants), keep R&D under Shawn’s academic lab for now, and **revisit the details** once the patent is official. As the group chat suggests, you’ll **refine** and **finalize** the arrangement after you see real market feedback and get closer to transferring IP from AU to Lewenza Labs.
