Below is a **high-level review** of the notes, the group chat, and the context regarding Athabasca University (AU) owning the patent rights initially. It also incorporates the plan for **Lewenza Labs** to potentially acquire the IP in the future, and the need for a **lab services agreement** with the University of Calgary (U of C). Finally, it provides an assessment of whether we have enough to draft an **agreement in principle**, along with recommended next steps.

---

## 1. Overall Observations

### 1.1 Patent Owned by Athabasca University (AU)
- Currently, **AU holds the patent** (or at least pending patent application rights).  
- **Shawn** is the named inventor due to his role as a professor; the research lab remains at AU.  
- The group envisions **Luminous** initially negotiating a **license** directly with AU, giving Luminous the right to commercialize.

### 1.2 Future Transfer of IP
- Once the patent is granted (or near granted), **Shawn** could form **Lewenza Labs** and **negotiate a transfer** of the IP from AU to Lewenza Labs.  
- This means that for a transitional period, the patent **remains at AU** while Luminous commercializes under a **university license**.  
- When the time is right, the IP can be **moved** from AU to Lewenza Labs, presumably with compensation or terms to be determined.

### 1.3 Two-Company vs. One-Company
- **Greg** and **Jeff** still lean toward two entities—Lewenza Labs (IP) and Luminous Bio Solutions (commercial).  
- **Shawn** wants to ensure the IP is protected, but also not overcomplicate things prematurely.  
- Given that the IP is **not yet** under Shawn's direct control, forming **Lewenza Labs** can be **phased in** once the transfer is imminent.

### 1.4 Voting Control & Governance

#### Lewenza Labs (Future IP Entity)
- If and when Lewenza Labs is formed (i.e., once the patent is ready for transfer from AU), **Shawn** will initially own **100%** of the shares (including voting rights).  
- **Greg** and **Jeff** may be granted **options** to purchase equity in Lewenza Labs at a future date, potentially allowing them to share in any economic upside without affecting Shawn's voting control.

#### Luminous (Current/Commercial Entity)
- **Shawn** holds **all voting shares** in Luminous, giving him ultimate decision-making authority on major corporate actions.  
- **Greg** and **Jeff** each receive **common, non-voting shares** in Luminous, ensuring they participate equally with Shawn in the **economic value** (dividends, retained earnings, share appreciation) without altering Shawn's voting control.  
- In this scenario, all three parties share **economic benefits** on an equal basis, but Shawn retains a **tiebreaker** or final say in governance matters.

This approach achieves the following:

1. **Protects Shawn's IP interests** and maintains his ultimate decision-making authority in both entities, which aligns with the role of inventor and primary researcher.  
2. **Allows Greg and Jeff** to invest their time, skills, and resources into commercial operations, and still **share in the upside** without threatening Shawn's voting control.  
3. **Keeps governance simple** by separating **voting power** from **economic participation**, which may prove advantageous if disagreements arise or if the company seeks outside investment later.

### 1.5 Equity & Share Classes

#### Lewenza Labs (Future IP Entity)
- Shawn will initially own **100%** of the shares (including all voting rights).  
- Greg and Jeff may receive **options** to purchase equity at a later date, allowing them to participate in Lewenza Labs' economic upside without changing Shawn's voting majority.

#### Luminous (Commercial Entity)
- Shawn holds **all voting shares**, thereby retaining final decision-making authority.  
- Greg and Jeff each hold **non-voting common shares**, ensuring **equal economic participation** in the company's value (e.g., dividends, retained earnings, share appreciation).  
- While Greg and Jeff do not have voting power in Luminous, they remain actively involved in day-to-day operations and strategic decisions by virtue of their roles (operations, sales/marketing).

This arrangement balances **Shawn's desire for IP and voting control** with **Greg and Jeff's interest** in capturing the company's economic benefits. It also keeps clear lines between **voting shares** (held by Shawn) and **non-voting shares** (held by Jeff and Greg, in equal proportions to voting shares if so desired for economic splitting), aligning with the group's priorities.

### 1.6 Licensing Strategy
- In the **near term**, Luminous negotiates an **exclusive license** with AU, letting Luminous proceed to market.  
- In the **longer term**, once the IP is officially transferred from AU to **Lewenza Labs**, Luminous transitions to a **license** or **royalty arrangement** with Lewenza Labs.  
- This phased approach avoids setting up Lewenza Labs too soon, since **AU** is the current IP owner.

### 1.7 Funding & Capital Contributions
- Everyone still anticipates a small **initial cash contribution** (e.g., $? each for Luminous).  
- **No large outlay** is expected for R&D since Shawn's academic lab at AU covers much of the early research cost.  
- When Lewenza Labs eventually acquires the patent from AU, the **value** of the IP (and any payment terms) will need to be recognized.

### 1.8 Group Chat Insights
- Shawn finds the overall legal structure **overwhelming** but sees the importance of hashing out details.  
- Jeff wants to **keep things simple** initially, quickly test market assumptions, and only finalize more complex arrangements once there's real traction.  
- Greg echoes the preference for **two entities** but is open to a phased implementation.

### 1.9 Lab Services at the University of Calgary (U of C)
- Shawn’s lab is **physically located at the U of C** Foothills Medical Campus, under an arrangement between the U of C and AU (since Shawn is an associate professor at U of C and a full-time professor at AU).  
- **Early testing and commercial services** for Luminous would be provided by Shawn’s U of C lab, requiring a **lab services agreement** with the U of C (and possibly AU’s sign-off).  
- In the future, if Luminous (or Lewenza Labs) has the capital to establish its own lab, or if AU prefers relocating services to an AU facility, the lab operations could shift. However, this is seen as a **long-term** possibility.

## 2. Do We Have Enough for an Agreement in Principle?

### Short Answer: Yes

We appear to have **sufficient alignment** on these core points:

### 2.1 IP Roadmap
- In the **short term**, Luminous licenses IP directly from AU.  
- In the **long term**, IP transfers to Lewenza Labs (owned by Shawn in voting shares, with Greg/Jeff potentially holding non-voting shares or options).

### 2.2 Two-Entity Vision
- Lewenza Labs eventually becomes the **IP holder** once AU transfers the patent.  
- Luminous handles **commercialization**, with Greg, Jeff, and Shawn as **co-owners** (though Shawn holds voting shares) and a **licensing agreement** from Lewenza Labs when the time comes.

### 2.3 Shawn's Voting Control
- **Lewenza Labs:** Shawn will own all voting shares (initially 100% ownership). Greg and Jeff may later acquire non-voting equity or options without affecting Shawn's majority vote.  
- **Luminous:** Shawn likewise holds all voting shares, retaining final decision-making authority. Greg and Jeff receive non-voting common shares that grant equal economic rights, ensuring they can actively drive business decisions in their operational roles while Shawn retains ultimate voting control.

### 2.4 Initial Funding & Roles
- Each founder contributes **roughly equal startup cash** to Luminous; Shawn's **academic lab** covers R&D until the IP is formally moved.  
- **No immediate** large personal R&D investment needed from Shawn, Greg, or Jeff.

### 2.5 Keeping It Simple at First
- The group is open to a **phased** approach: start with Luminous + an AU license, then form Lewenza Labs once the patent is near final.  
- We can codify that in an "agreement in principle," ensuring everyone understands the eventual goal of a **two-company** structure.

### 2.6 Lab Services Agreement
- An **agreement** with the U of C (and possibly AU) is necessary to formalize Shawn’s lab providing testing services to Luminous.  
- This can be addressed in the same phased approach, acknowledging that lab services may move to a **Luminous-owned** or **Lewenza Labs-owned** facility in the future if circumstances allow.

## 3. Recommended Next Steps

### 3.1 Draft a Short "Agreement in Principle"
- Clearly reference the **AU licensing step** as the immediate approach (i.e., Luminous obtains a license from AU).  
- Outline that once the patent is near completion, **Lewenza Labs** will be formed or activated, and the IP will be **transferred** from AU to Lewenza Labs, with Shawn holding **majority voting**.

### 3.2 Define the Share & Voting Structures
- **Lewenza Labs** (future IP holder):  
  - Shawn: voting shares (majority or 100%).  
  - Greg & Jeff: non-voting shares or options, if they want economic participation in the IP.
- **Luminous** (commercial entity):  
  - Shawn holds voting shares, while Greg and Jeff hold non-voting shares for equal economic stakes.

### 3.3 Establish a "Phase-In" Timeline
- Phase 1: **Luminous + AU License** to test the market and sign initial customers.  
- Phase 2: **Form Lewenza Labs** once the patent is granted or near granted.  
- Phase 3: **Finalize an exclusive license** from Lewenza Labs to Luminous, replacing the AU license.

### 3.4 Detail Governance & Dispute Resolution
- For Luminous, specify how major decisions (e.g., raising capital, licensing terms, expansions) are approved.  
- Add a **mediation clause** for disputes.  
- Outline how "inactive partners" or "buyout" scenarios are handled, even if only in broad strokes for now.

### 3.5 Negotiate Lab Services Agreement
- Identify the **key parties** (U of C and potentially AU) and define the **scope** of services, fees, and liabilities.  
- Clarify a **path to transition** if Luminous or Lewenza Labs establishes its own lab or relocates to an AU facility later.

### 3.6 Seek Light Legal Review
- Consult an attorney familiar with **university-owned IP transfers** and **lab service agreements** to ensure the plan is realistic.  
- This is especially important if the universities want royalties or impose specific conditions on both IP licensing and lab operations.

## 4. Conclusion

Given our discussions, the **lab services context**, and the desire to keep things **simple** while still protecting Shawn's invention, we appear to have **enough clarity** to:

- Draft a **basic founders' agreement** or "agreement in principle" that spells out the **short-term licensing arrangement** with AU, the plan to **form Lewenza Labs** down the road, the **voting/equity** structure in each entity, **and** a lab services agreement with the U of C.  
- Formally recognize that **Shawn** holds all **voting shares** of Lewenza Labs (once established) and Greg/Jeff may have **non-voting** or **option** shares if they wish to participate economically in the IP.  
- In **Luminous**, Shawn retains voting control, while Greg and Jeff share in the economic upside through **non-voting common shares**.  
- Include a **timeline** or **trigger event** (e.g., the patent is nearly granted) for when Lewenza Labs will be created, and how it will **license** IP to Luminous.  
- Incorporate a **lab services agreement** with U of C (and possibly AU) for early-stage testing and commercial services, while leaving open the option of relocating those services in the future.

That level of structure allows us to **start talking to customers** (as Jeff wants), keep R&D under Shawn's academic lab for now, and **revisit the details** once the patent is official and the IP can be transferred to Lewenza Labs. As the group chat suggests, we'll **refine** and **finalize** the arrangement after we see real market feedback and near-completion of the patent process.
