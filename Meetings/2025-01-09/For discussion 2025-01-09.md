## 1. Company Structure

### Q1: What are the advantages and disadvantages of forming two companies (e.g., Lewenza Labs for IP, Luminous Bio Solutions for operations) vs. one company?

Why It Matters:  
- The decision affects IP protection, liabilities, costs, and strategic flexibility for future investment, expansion, and potential acquisitions.

Two-Company Structure  
- Advantages:  
  1. IP Protection: Lewenza Labs owns the IP, insulating it from operational risks or lawsuits in Luminous.  
  2. Separation of R&D vs. Commercialization: Clear delineation of roles—R&D (Lewenza Labs) vs. sales/operations (Luminous).  
  3. Flexibility for Investment/Acquisition: Easier to spin off or sell one entity if, for example, a buyer only wants the IP or only the operational side.  
  4. Shawn Retains Control Over IP: Ensures he has final say on how the patent and research evolve.

- Disadvantages:  
  1. Higher Setup & Maintenance Costs: Incorporation fees, legal/accounting expenses, tax filings, and administrative overhead effectively double.  
  2. More Complex Administration: Requires inter-company agreements (licensing, service contracts, etc.).  
  3. Potential Tax Considerations: Income and expenses must be allocated properly between two entities, complicating filings.

One-Company Structure  
- Advantages:  
  1. Lower Initial and Ongoing Costs: Incorporation (~$950), plus lower legal/administrative fees.  
  2. Simplicity: One set of bank accounts, books, and shareholder agreements.  
  3. Straightforward Profit Sharing & Decision-Making: No inter-company licensing needed.

- Disadvantages:  
  1. IP Potentially At Risk: If the single company faces lawsuits or debt, IP is exposed.  
  2. Less Flexible for Future Splits/Investments: Spinning out or selling the IP alone is more cumbersome later.  
  3. Ownership Tangles: If partners disagree on how to handle IP vs. operations, it’s harder to keep them separate.

## 2. Voting Control and Governance

### Q2: In a two-company model (e.g., Lewenza Labs for IP, Luminous Bio Solutions for commercialization), how should voting control be structured among Shawn (inventor), Greg (operations/tech), and Jeff (sales/marketing)?

Why It Matters:  
- When IP ownership and commercialization are split between two entities, you need clarity on who makes final decisions—particularly around Shawn’s patent and ongoing R&D, as well as strategic and operational moves within the commercial entity.

Possible Answers & Structures:

1. Shawn Owns All Voting Shares in Lewenza Labs; Equal Voting in Luminous  
   - **Mechanism:**  
     - Lewenza Labs (IP holder): Shawn holds all voting shares (and possibly Greg/Jeff hold non-voting shares for economic participation or options to purchase at future dates).  
     - Luminous Bio Solutions (operations): Shawn, Greg, and Jeff each have equal voting shares or a board structure with equal representation.  
   - **Pros:**  
     - Protects Shawn’s IP interests and ensures he retains control over R&D decisions.  
     - Encourages collaboration and equal say in day-to-day commercial operations.  
   - **Cons:**  
     - Shawn’s dominance in the IP entity may leave Greg and Jeff feeling less empowered about patent-related decisions.  
     - Two distinct voting schemes can add complexity when making cross-entity decisions (e.g., licensing, revenue sharing).

2. Shawn Maintains Majority Voting Power in Both Entities  
   - **Mechanism:**  
     - Lewenza Labs: Shawn owns a majority (or 100%) of voting shares, Greg and Jeff own non-voting shares (if at all, or options to purchase at future dates).  
     - Luminous Bio Solutions: Shawn still holds a majority of voting shares, while Greg and Jeff have minority voting stakes or only non-voting shares.  
   - **Pros:**  
     - Preserves Shawn’s final authority on both R&D and commercial decisions, aligning with the goal of IP protection.  
   - **Cons:**  
     - Greg and Jeff may feel sidelined regarding key business or operational strategies.  
     - Could reduce collaboration if decisions are ultimately controlled by one partner.

3. Board-Control or Hybrid Mechanism  
   - **Mechanism:**  
     - Lewenza Labs: Shawn as controlling shareholder (e.g., majority of voting shares), possibly with a small board if Greg and Jeff hold non-voting or minority positions.  
     - Luminous Bio Solutions: Equal share ownership, but a board structure grants Shawn a tiebreaker or “founder veto” on critical decisions tied to IP usage.  
   - **Pros:**  
     - Balances Shawn’s need to protect IP with a more democratic approach to commercial operations.  
     - Major decisions might require unanimous consent, ensuring all founders feel included.  
   - **Cons:**  
     - Requires careful drafting of “reserved matters” or “founder veto rights” to avoid deadlocks.  
     - More complex to administer when major decisions affect both companies (e.g., renegotiating a licensing deal).

> [!note] Greg note
> [2025-01-09 11:00 AM]
> I am in favour of option 2 where Shawn maintains majority voting power in both entities. Maybe not exactly as it's outlined here but the principle of it.

## 3. Equity Splits and Share Classes

### Q3: How should equity and economic rights be divided?

Why It Matters:  
- Determines how profits are shared, how future investments or buyouts occur, and how each partner’s contributions (cash, IP, sweat equity) are valued.

Possible Answers & Structures:

1. Two-Class Shares (Voting vs. Non-Voting)  
   - Example:  
     - Shawn gets 100 voting shares.  
     - Greg and Jeff each get 100 non-voting shares.  
   - Pros: Shawn retains voting control; Greg/Jeff still share in profits/economic upside.  
   - Cons: More complex share structure, must be carefully documented to avoid confusion with investors later.

2. All Common Shares, Weighted by Roles  
   - Mechanism: Assign different percentages that reflect IP, capital, or sweat equity (e.g., Shawn 40%, Greg 30%, Jeff 30%), but with no special voting rights.  
   - Pros: Simple share class, easy to communicate.  
   - Cons: Shawn’s IP interest might be undervalued if it’s not given controlling rights.

3. Hybrid Approach (IP in Lewenza Labs + Equal Splits in Luminous Bio Solutions)  
   - Mechanism: Shawn owns Lewenza Labs (IP), each partner owns 33.3% of Luminous, with Shawn holding voting control in Luminous via special shares.  
	   - optionally, there should be the ability for Greg and Jeff to purchase shares (minority) at some point in the future of Lewenza Labs.
   - Pros: Balances IP protection with equal operational ownership; very flexible for licensing deals.  
   - Cons: Involves two entities, more legal fees and complexity.

## 4. IP Licensing and Inter-Company Agreements

### Q4: How should IP be licensed if there are two companies?

Why It Matters:  
- The licensing agreement defines how Luminous Bio Solutions can use or commercialize Lewenza Labs’ IP.

Possible Answers & Structures:

1. Exclusive License  
   - Luminous has the sole right to use the IP.  
   - Pros: Enhances Luminous’s market position; attractive to investors.  
   - Cons: Must define royalty rates, revenue sharing, renewal terms, and what happens if Luminous underperforms or dissolves.

2. Non-Exclusive License  
   - Lewenza Labs can license IP to other companies.  
   - Pros: Potential for multiple revenue streams.  
   - Cons: Could undercut Luminous’s unique advantage.

3. Field- or Territory-Specific License  
   - For example, Luminous gets exclusive rights for oil & gas applications, possible exclusivity in Canada or North America, while Lewenza Labs can license to other jurisdictions.  
   - Pros: Balances Luminous’s exclusivity with potential expansions elsewhere.  
   - Cons: Higher contractual complexity; must define strict boundaries.

## 5. Funding and Capital Contributions

### Q5: How should the initial (and future) funding be handled under one-company vs. two-company scenarios?

Why It Matters:  
- Each founder is expected to contribute some cash initially (e.g., \$5,000). However, as the business grows, additional capital may be required—whether for R&D, commercialization, or both. Determining who contributes, how much, and when can affect each partner’s equity stake and influence.

### One-Company Structure

1. **Equal Cash Contributions**  
   - **Mechanism:** All three founders (Shawn, Greg, Jeff) contribute the same dollar amount.  
   - **Pros:**  
     - Straightforward to administer—everyone has equal “skin in the game.”  
     - Avoids early debates about valuing Shawn’s IP separately.  
   - **Cons:**  
     - Ignores any intangible contributions (e.g., Shawn’s IP, specialized sweat equity).  
     - May overburden a partner with fewer liquid resources.

2. **IP as Shawn’s Contribution, Cash from Others**  
   - **Mechanism:** Place a monetary value on Shawn’s patent or invention. This offsets (fully or partially) his cash requirement, so Greg and Jeff contribute more cash to match Shawn’s IP.  
   - **Pros:**  
     - Acknowledges the value of Shawn's IP from day one.  
     - Reduces Shawn’s out-of-pocket expenses, reflecting the upfront IP contribution.  
   - **Cons:**  
     - Assigning a fair valuation to the IP can be contentious.  
     - Requires an agreed-upon formula or external valuation to avoid future disputes.

3. **Future Capital Calls**  
   - **Mechanism:** Define milestones or triggers (e.g., run rate, new product launch) where additional investment is required. If a partner doesn’t contribute, others can invest and dilute the non-participants.  
   - **Pros:**  
     - Aligns funding with actual growth and cash needs.  
     - Can be structured to reward partners willing to invest more at critical junctures.  
   - **Cons:**  
     - Partners must be prepared for potential dilution if they can’t contribute later.  
     - Negotiating the details (valuations, deadlines) can become complex.

> [2025-01-09 11:40 AM]
> I am not in favour of the "one-company" structure as it feels like it could get convoluted quickly

### Two-Company Structure (e.g., Lewenza Labs for IP, Luminous Bio Solutions for Operations)

1. **Initial Cash into Luminous Bio Solutions, Minimal Funding in Lewenza Labs**  
   - **Mechanism:**  
     - Shawn primarily capitalizes Lewenza Labs with his IP (and minimal cash, if any).  
     - Greg, Jeff and Shawn invest startup capital into Luminous Bio Solutions.  
   - **Pros:**  
     - Clearly segments the R&D/IP side (Shawn’s domain) from commercialization.  
     - Greg, Jeff and Shawn focus cash where short-term expenses (e.g., sales, marketing, operations) will occur.  
   - **Cons:**  
     - Lewenza Labs might need funding later for further R&D if Shawn can’t finance it alone.  
     - Requires a licensing agreement for Luminous to use the IP.

2. **Split Contributions Across Both Companies**  
   - **Mechanism:**  
     - All founders invest in Lewenza Labs for ongoing R&D, and also invest in Luminous Bio Solutions for commercialization.  
     - Shawn’s IP can be assigned a specific dollar value that offsets his share of cash in Lewenza Labs.  
   - **Pros:**  
     - Ensures each entity has working capital; reduces the risk of underfunding the R&D side.  
     - Provides Greg and Jeff with an economic stake in the IP entity.  
   - **Cons:**  
     - More complex to track who owns what in each entity.  
     - Valuing the IP in Lewenza Labs still poses challenges.

3. **Future Funding / Capital Calls in Each Entity**  
   - **Mechanism:**  
     - Define separate capital-call triggers for Lewenza Labs (e.g., new patents, prototypes) and Luminous Bio Solutions (e.g., product launches, scaling).  
     - If a founder cannot meet a capital call in one entity, they may face dilution **only in that entity** (rather than across the board).  
   - **Pros:**  
     - Tailors funding to the distinct needs of R&D vs. commercialization.  
     - Partners can choose where to allocate their capital based on interest or resources.  
   - **Cons:**  
     - Could lead to uneven ownership stakes and control across the two companies.  
     - Requires tight legal and accounting frameworks to manage parallel investment rounds.

> [2025-01-09 11:50 AM]
> I prefer option 1 here

### Key Takeaways

- **Valuing Shawn’s IP** is critical whether you have one or two companies; it’s simpler to skip formal IP valuation at the outset, but that may cause disputes later.  
- **Equal cash contributions** foster simplicity but don’t address intangible contributions or different financial capacities.  
- **Future capital calls** are common in startups—plan for them by specifying how valuations will be determined and what happens if a partner can’t invest more.  
- In **two-company scenarios**, decide how cash flows to each entity and how each founder’s contributions (cash or IP) translate into equity and control in the respective business.

A sound approach is to establish a **founders’ agreement** or **unanimous shareholder agreement** that spells out these funding rules in detail, ensuring all partners have clarity on when and how additional investment might be required.

## 6. Dispute Resolution

### Q6: How should the partners handle disputes or deadlocks?

Why It Matters:  
- A partnership can derail quickly if there’s no agreed-upon process for resolving disagreements about major decisions.

Possible Answers & Structures:

1. Mediation/Arbitration Clause  
   - Pros: Faster, often cheaper than court.  
   - Cons: Still requires time and expense, but avoids drawn-out litigation.

2. Shotgun Clause  
   - Partner A names a price to buy Partner B’s shares, and B must either accept or buy A’s shares at that price.  
   - Pros: Forces quick resolution.  
   - Cons: Tricky with three partners; can lead to adversarial outcomes.

3. Board or Founder Veto Rights  
   - Certain decisions require unanimous approval or special founder consent.  
   - Pros: Protects key interests (e.g., IP).  
   - Cons: Can lead to stalemates if used too broadly.

> [!note] Greg note
> [2025-01-09 11:51 AM]
> I think option 1, mediation, is the best likely course. A shotgun really only works with 2 partners. Option 3 also works but that likely requires a "board". Possible to migrate from "1" to "3" later (?)

## 7. Handling Inactive Partners

### Q7: What if one of the partners stops contributing or becomes inactive?

Why It Matters:  
- Early-stage companies rely heavily on each partner’s expertise and time. Inactivity can derail momentum.

Possible Answers & Mechanisms:

1. Buyout at Predefined Terms  
   - For example, if a partner is inactive for X months, the company can repurchase their shares at a set formula.  
   - Pros: Protects active partners from “dead weight.”  
   - Cons: Must define “inactive” objectively and fairly.

2. Conversion to Non-Voting Shares  
   - If a partner fails to meet milestones or responsibilities, their voting rights might convert to non-voting.  
   - Pros: Preserves their economic stake but removes decision-making power.  
   - Cons: Requires well-defined performance metrics.

3. Vesting Schedules  
   - Equity is earned over time or upon milestones.  
   - Pros: Reduces the risk of a partner leaving immediately with significant ownership.  
   - Cons: Adds complexity and ongoing tracking.

## 8. Future Growth and Exit Strategies

### Q8: How does the chosen structure impact scaling, raising capital, or eventually selling the business?

Why It Matters:  
- Both the internal structure and the shareholder agreement need to accommodate expansions into new markets (e.g., U.S.), large capital raises, or a potential acquisition.

Possible Answers & Considerations:

1. Investment Rounds  
   - A two-company structure might attract investors specifically for the IP or for the operations side.  
   - A one-company structure is simpler for typical venture investments.  
   - Pros/Cons: More complexity vs. simpler term sheets.

2. Strategic Partner/Acquisition  
   - Drag-Along and Tag-Along: Ensures minority shareholders can’t block a major sale (drag-along), and minority shareholders can join a major sale on the same terms (tag-along).  
   - Pros: Smooth exit if a big buyer wants the entire operation.  
   - Cons: Minority holders lose some autonomy if the majority wants to sell.

3. Revenue Targets & Milestones  
   - The structure should help manage client relationships, expansions, and potential pivots.

## 9. Cost and Legal Review

### Q9: What are the cost implications and next steps for legal review?

Why It Matters:  
- Legal fees can add up quickly; budgeting for them is crucial. Any structure must comply with tax laws and potentially leverage SR&ED credits for R&D.

Key Points:

- Initial Incorporation: ~$950 for one company, roughly double for two.  
- Lawyer’s Hourly Rate: $625/hour (Bob Benson).  
- Shareholder Agreement Costs: Additional fees for drafting and reviewing.  
- Tax & SR&ED Considerations: Especially relevant if R&D remains in a separate entity.

---

## Putting It All Together

1. Immediate vs. Phased Approach:  
   - Some founders prefer to set up both companies from Day One for clarity.  
   - Others suggest starting with one (perhaps Luminous) and spinning off Lewenza Labs later if the IP requires separate handling.

2. Balancing IP Control with Simplicity:  
   - Shawn’s interest in protecting his patent suggests leaning toward the two-company model with a licensing agreement.  
   - However, the team must weigh extra cost and complexity against the benefits of an easier-to-manage single-company solution.

3. Shareholder Agreement Essentials:  
   - Voting vs. non-voting shares  
   - Exit strategies (drag-along, tag-along, buy-sell)  
   - Dispute resolution  
   - Vesting or performance clauses  
   - Funding and capital calls

4. Next Steps & Recommendations:  
   - Finalize the choice: one or two entities?  
   - Draft a Unanimous Shareholder Agreement (USA) or similar legal document that addresses all key Q&A points.  
   - Clarify royalty/licensing terms if using two entities.  
   - Budget for legal and accounting to implement the structure properly.  
   - Keep the option to revisit or refine the structure after certain milestones (e.g., first major client, initial revenue targets).

---

### Final Note

From all the data (meeting notes, repository references, and cost analysis), the partners currently seem inclined toward a two-company approach. Shawn would keep IP in Lewenza Labs, while Luminous Bio Solutions handles commercialization—both sharing economic benefits but with Shawn holding voting control to safeguard the invention. This setup aligns with:

• Shawn’s priority of IP protection.  
• Greg’s and Jeff’s interests in fair equity stakes and operational roles.  
• Future flexibility to attract investment or facilitate an acquisition without jeopardizing the core patent.

Whichever path we choose, clarity in legal agreements and alignment on each partner’s role is the most critical factor for success.
