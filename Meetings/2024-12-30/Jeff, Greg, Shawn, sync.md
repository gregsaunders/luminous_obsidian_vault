Jeff Violo   0:45
Gregory.

Greg Saunders   0:47
Hey, how are you?

Jeff Violo   0:51
About how are you?

Greg Saunders   0:53
Alright.

Jeff Violo   0:57
My.
Can you hear me now?

Greg Saunders   1:02
No.

Jeff Violo   1:04
Which?

Greg Saunders   1:04
Yeah, I can hear you.

Jeff Violo   1:09
The box just I just dropped him off at when sport.

Greg Saunders   1:18
Oh, you're in Calgary.

Jeff Violo   1:20
I'm in Calgary.

Greg Saunders   1:22
Nice.

Jeff Violo   1:24
How was your Christmas time?

Greg Saunders   1:28
It was.
It was.
It was good.
It was.
It was a.

Jeff Violo   1:31
I've got a bad connection.
Don't.
Or you can or you can hear me.
OK, good.

Greg Saunders   1:35
I can hear you.
Yeah.

Shawn Lewenza   1:41
Hi.

Greg Saunders   1:43
Hey, Doctor Louis, how's it going?

Shawn Lewenza   1:47
Good.

Greg Saunders   1:49
Hey, thanks for the.

Jeff Violo   1:49
Hey, Sean.

Greg Saunders   1:51
Thanks for the Mark is gift card.
It's much appreciated.
We'll put that to good use.

Shawn Lewenza   1:56
I'm sure you will.

Greg Saunders   2:00
Ohhhhh God.
OK I I have been sleeping like 12 hours a day since since I stopped working.

Shawn Lewenza   2:09
Oh, good for you.

Greg Saunders   2:12
And I and I think I need to keep doing that for a while like the rest.
Another week of that, ohe my God.

Shawn Lewenza   2:19
I saw I saw.
Picture your wife posted of your kids were up and waiting for you to wake up on Christmas morning. Yeah.

Greg Saunders   2:26
Yeah.
Why you adult children waiting for me to get out of bed to open presents from Santa?

Shawn Lewenza   2:32
Yeah.

Jeff Violo   2:33
Hey, guys.

Greg Saunders   2:33
Yeah, yeah.

Jeff Violo   2:38
OK sorry I got it.

Greg Saunders   2:38
Hello.
Yeah, I can hear you.

Jeff Violo   2:41
I got a ****** connection.
You guys are blipping out of tiny bit here.
I I'm just trying to get to a point where I can park and hopefully the the the connections gonna stabilize your bit.

Greg Saunders   2:53
She's well, I didn't have anything.
I really wanted to talk about today other than like, let's just take another week off.
I'm just.
I'm just baked.

Shawn Lewenza   3:03
It's.

Greg Saunders   3:03
I don't really wanna.
I don't wanna talk or think about work for another week.

Shawn Lewenza   3:07
OK, that's fine with me.
I mean, I have to go back on Thursday.

Jeff Violo   3:09
Photo.

Shawn Lewenza   3:11
I'm trying to soak them next last few days.

Jeff Violo   3:12
OK.
So that's cool.
But Sean, can you just give me a bit more of a synopsis about that last um, that last Test that you did cause it sounds like it was sort of very validating and groundbreaking.
I just wanted to hear your perspective because I'm trying to decipher it through the through the text message, but I was more interested to kind of know what what was significant about that in your perspective.

Shawn Lewenza   3:32
Yeah.
Um, well, the one was the way we did it.

Jeff Violo   3:41
Say.

Shawn Lewenza   3:42
So instead of doing it in liquid where the machine measures the light and the light is just, um, three or four fold higher when there's the chemical in the water.
Um, we did it on an Agar plate and I it's just a way to visualize it more.

Jeff Violo   3:55
Hmm.

Shawn Lewenza   4:02
So, um, if you spot the chemical on the plate, the there's a ring of luminescence around the chemical.
And it wasn't.

Jeff Violo   4:10
Hmm.

Shawn Lewenza   4:11
It wasn't a these things work really well when you have pure chemical and you dilute it down to the concentrations you might find in the water.

Jeff Violo   4:12
For me.

Shawn Lewenza   4:19
But this was actual tailings water, so that was the other part.

Greg Saunders   4:23
So on.

Shawn Lewenza   4:24
Is that just?

Greg Saunders   4:25
Yeah, on an unadulterated sample, you didn't do anything to purify it and then dilute it later.
You just took.
It was just a raw sample.

Shawn Lewenza   4:32
Well, if you took 10, if you took a some like the spots are very small volumes.
Otherwise, they occupy a huge zone, so if you took a small spot of raw water, you wouldn't see anything we did did we took a mill of water and evaporated it down to a very small volume and then spotted it.

Greg Saunders   4:38
Yeah.
OK.

Shawn Lewenza   4:50
So we did concentrate it just by evaporation and then there were two or three levels of.
Concentrations that we tested that were positive and the rest were negative.

Jeff Violo   5:00
Thank you.

Shawn Lewenza   5:01
So we know we have to concentrate at that certain fold, but I had.
We knew we tested that water previously and we knew that we could detect it and we tested many other samples, maybe twenty others, but um, we don't have many of those actual tailings pond sample water samples.
So will everyone that we had, we've tested and um, we've never visualized it.
So the point is you could do it really quickly and.
To get a visual that could be a prescreen before you so you know how to treat the sample in order to get the result you want.
I just thought it would be visual for you to see and it was actually a faint ring.

Jeff Violo   5:42
So.
I thought.

Shawn Lewenza   5:47
In other circumstances, the ring can be more pronounced, but given that these are such complicated mixtures and every individual chemical is very dilute compared like the total concentration of Nas is high but the individual chemical structure is low because there's hundreds of chemicals that make up NA.

Greg Saunders   6:08
Hmm.

Jeff Violo   6:10
So as I understand this could be done in the field.
Was another thing that I kind of got out of this is that is that true?
Like with the way that you're doing this, this might be like effective for field tests just for validation of annies in the water or.

Shawn Lewenza   6:24
No, because you have to image that plate in the lab.
You have to use a special camera that sees luminescence.

Jeff Violo   6:30
OK.

Shawn Lewenza   6:31
Um, there is a way to do it in the field, but that's not the way.

Jeff Violo   6:34
OK, cool.
OK, well I'm.
I'm impatiently saying.
OK, let's, let's wait another week.
I'm excited to sort of get chatting and get things going.
I got lots of thoughts, but yeah, I've got my son anyways, so this is probably not a bad strategy.
Will take some time and so do we wanna just push this out exactly one week to to Monday from the same time, same place next week.

Greg Saunders   7:04
I think so.
Yeah, I mean that that works for me.
I.
What's what's your?
What's Monday like for you?
After the weekend so.

Shawn Lewenza   7:13
I have.
I have a lab meeting every Monday morning at around.
Um, 1030 Alberta time and it goes till around noon.

Greg Saunders   7:24
Noon your time.
Or do you know?

Shawn Lewenza   7:25
No.
Noon your time.

Greg Saunders   7:28
So did you wanna take an hour for lunch and then pick up again at one?
Or do you want to go like right into?

Jeff Violo   7:36
It's OK.

Shawn Lewenza   7:37
It might.
It might might be better to go to one because sometimes it goes.
I don't think it'll go long cause everyone's been on holiday, so to be honest, we probably won't even have one because, well, actually we should have one.
So yeah, 1:00 would be best.

Greg Saunders   7:53
OK.

Shawn Lewenza   7:54
But that if that works for you guys.

Greg Saunders   7:56
Yep.

Jeff Violo   7:56
Yep, that works for me.

Greg Saunders   7:57
Yeah.
Worse for me.

Shawn Lewenza   8:00
I'm going to get started on a few things.
That I've been meaning to do and give and mail and send it to you a few days before, which is I'd like to get the questionnaire more um.
Worked on and used the template that the consultant gave me and and my email list of contacts.

Greg Saunders   8:23
Hey.

Jeff Violo   8:24
Yep, that would be great.

Shawn Lewenza   8:26
Again, I gave it by the weekend.

Jeff Violo   8:30
Yeah, as soon as you get that to me that that would be great because I wouldn't mind getting starting to peruse the list.
I wanna kind of like to check out a little bit on LinkedIn who they are, who's who in the zoo, get a bit of A cause.
I that's ultimately what I want to do is start to craft a target list of people we wanna go after from, from industry, from oil and gas, everything.
So I think us having a good focus on who we're going after is gonna be important for getting out, getting out of the blocks early in, in January.

Greg Saunders   8:58
Yeah.

Shawn Lewenza   9:06
That list that you're talking about is all inclusive.
I would think right?
Um all possible interested parties in, yeah.

Jeff Violo   9:17
Yeah.
Yeah, it and even influencers, right?
Like like I just wanna build a list of, you know?
Who?
Who in the government's important to actually be aware of the value of this product?

Greg Saunders   9:27
Yeah.

Jeff Violo   9:28
You know who who within all of the oil and gas ohm operators do we want to know about this?

Greg Saunders   9:30
See what?

Jeff Violo   9:35
Like I wanna start to craft just a list of people that we wanna have continuous dialogue with, educating them, bringing, you know, and maybe they'll be.

Greg Saunders   9:37
Yeah.

Jeff Violo   9:46
It starts to be a big triangulation game, right?
Who else would find this interesting and that will help us craft a message and just sort of.
No.
Make sure that we're kinda, you know, we're not going with the shotgun.
We're kind of coming at this with a rifle and and being very.
I'm very focused on who are going after so and I don't have that picture.
That's why I'm I'd like to see that as soon as possible, so when I get the list, what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna probably create a spreadsheet or a database of this, but then I'm gonna start to use LinkedIn and another tool that we have to start to to build that target account list. So.

Shawn Lewenza   10:25
Yeah, like, I'll give you a phase A of it.
It's not gonna be a finalist by any means.

Jeff Violo   10:30
Yeah.
Well, and what?
What I'll be able to do is build on that right?

Greg Saunders   10:33
It's.

Jeff Violo   10:33
Because when I start to go into the LinkedIn cause I'm gonna start to look at the the positions that these people hold.

Greg Saunders   10:36
It's.

Jeff Violo   10:38
What their responsibilities are within the organizations, different things like that and then go OK, well, who at Suncor cause you don't know everybody, right?
So who?

Shawn Lewenza   10:47
Oh yeah.

Jeff Violo   10:47
Who else would you know, holds the similar positions?
That's what I want to start to do.

Shawn Lewenza   10:58
Yeah.
Like who in the Alberta energy regulator would be, you know, someone?
I wouldn't exactly know the current people in there, but.

Jeff Violo   11:06
Yep.
Yeah.
And and like you said, you've got contacts that Imperial oil, and you've got contacts that Synovus.
But there's also suncore that we really have to target send crude.
Maybe there's similar people there like cause they and I'm sure they all talk, but we want to actually start to create, you know, that whole list of people.

Greg Saunders   11:28
Well, actually, Sean know it's outside of um oil sands operators.
Jeff got a contact at.
Oh, who the **** is that, Jeff?

Jeff Violo   11:41
I don't know, Greg.

Greg Saunders   11:41
You're you're circuit is it?

Jeff Violo   11:42
I don't remember who.
Who are we talking about?

Greg Saunders   11:45
Is it a Nova?
Sorry, what's the what's the chemical plant?
Your buddy date is it Dave Nova?

Jeff Violo   11:50
OHP Nova.
Yeah, Nova.
Well, my well, my best friend Dave is like high up at Nova.
But if my neighbor I was talking to about and even Nova creates Anas right like and this is, this is a petrochemical plant.

Greg Saunders   12:00
Yeah.

Jeff Violo   12:03
Now I don't know if it's the same situation as the oil sands operators, but I was just telling my neighbor a little bit about this opportunity and he's like, I was explaining annies and he knew all about them.

Greg Saunders   12:05
It's.

Jeff Violo   12:15
So it's like, no, I didn't know anything about Denny's in the past, but.

Greg Saunders   12:16
OK.

Shawn Lewenza   12:17
Alright.
That's interesting.

Jeff Violo   12:23
Yeah.
And it's one of the largest petrochemical plants in North America, in central Alberta.
There, right, so.

Shawn Lewenza   12:30
What?
OK, I'm gonna look into that.
I don't know what that means.
It a petrochemical, I see them, but what is?

Jeff Violo   12:35
So Nova, like the petrochemical plants, they take a lot of feedstock which is Petro chemicals and I'm not.
I'm gonna bastardize this, but they make they make a lot of feedstocks for creating plastics, right?

Shawn Lewenza   12:45
Yeah.

Greg Saunders   12:45
It's the.

Shawn Lewenza   12:47
Yeah.

Jeff Violo   12:47
So they have this petrochemical plant and the output of that is I think they make the input to create plastics.
And I'm I'm gonna stop there.

Shawn Lewenza   12:58
Yeah.

Jeff Violo   12:59
But that's kind of what these plants do, so there's no bud, there is Union carbide.
I don't know if it's still union Carbide, if they've changed names or there's there's about three or four plants in central Alberta, so.

Shawn Lewenza   13:11
Do you know that there is a already a plan in place to like?
Replace the feedstocks of Petro chemicals with I'm biochemicals from plat, from by, from microbes.
So like feeling.

Jeff Violo   13:28
Alright, no, I've never heard that before it.
Sorry, you gotta you gotta tell me that again. So.

Shawn Lewenza   13:34
So instead of using oil for the feedstocks for plastics.

Jeff Violo   13:36
Yeah.

Shawn Lewenza   13:39
You can generate the same feedstock chemicals through microbial fermentation.
So the the problem is scaling it up and and it's not like they they know how to do it to some extent, like there's already biodegradable plastics for example, so they get the polymers get assembled from well from the bacteria themselves, but they get like they feed the bacteria simple sugars.

Jeff Violo   13:57
Yep.

Shawn Lewenza   14:07
And the trick is figuring out what to feed the bacteria to do it cost effectively.
So like if you could.

Jeff Violo   14:13
So you're you're you're telling me that there is an alternative to oil to build plastics?

Shawn Lewenza   14:21
Well, I yeah, there is.
But there's also the framework for the future of reinventing that that supply chain.
So the supply chain is not coming from petrochemicals.
It's coming from microbes fermenting the basic product.

Jeff Violo   14:35
Wow.

Shawn Lewenza   14:37
So like the, there's already some of that happening already.
And in places like really industrial places in Ontario to where they already.
So it's the early days of, like, that's what synthetic biology is offering is there and the possibility of engineering microbes to produce feedstocks for all the materials we need to build, not using oil.

Jeff Violo   14:59
So instead, so instead of having like these big furnaces and and factories, you got big fermentation pits to basically tanks.

Shawn Lewenza   15:07
Thanks.
Yeah, yeah.

Jeff Violo   15:10
Wow, that could be very disruptive.
My gosh.
So that's been one of the big things that I always, you know in central Alberta like we're looking at it going, what's the alternative to building plastics.
But that sounds like there is some stuff coming down the down the pipe, huh?

Shawn Lewenza   15:29
Yeah, I looked into it because I was thinking about building.
There's lots of plastic where you used in the lab, and it gets those into a landfill.

Jeff Violo   15:37
Yep.

Shawn Lewenza   15:40
Small, small bits of plastic, like little tips on hand pipettors that are dispensing small volumes of water, stuff like that.

Jeff Violo   15:47
It's.

Shawn Lewenza   15:48
They're consumables and um I my ex's parents worked in the plastics and mold making industry, and I was like, I looked into the concept of just using biodegradable plastics and making those materials, but and they do it to a very small extent right now.

Jeff Violo   15:55
Yep.

Shawn Lewenza   16:07
But like the existing system is so entrenched in how they do it and the cost of making the biodegradable plastics is higher.
But the all those things are on like we already have all kinds of biodegradable plastic stuff right now.
But I don't know who knows what the time frame is for a whole scale like reinvention of the system, but it it it's coming.

Jeff Violo   16:32
Wow.
Interesting.
Well, it's.
It's cool to think about, but let's think about what what the opportunities we have at hand that that's that's kinda blowing my mind, but NA's are very interesting thing and and and the thing that Sean that I'd like to talk a little bit about is how we become the go to.

Shawn Lewenza   16:51
Yeah.

Jeff Violo   16:59
Organization for understanding what CNA's are helping the regulators come to some kind of terms in regards to how the oil sands can start to release this into the water and us providing the the tools and the remediation to do that.
So you know that's that's where my mind's going with your experience and your contacts.
I think there's a tremendous opportunity to kind of build a lot of that into play, which could really help with, you know, securing revenue, securing the company.
You know, so yeah, that's the first thing, right like that.
That's the immediate thing.
I think that we can do and then maybe start to build a bit of a road map as to where we go from here.

Shawn Lewenza   17:46
Well, that's, I mean, that's the context of starting this business is that you become that person.

Jeff Violo   17:52
Yep.

Shawn Lewenza   17:52
So for the first little while, we just.
Make proclamations.
Do some ************.

Jeff Violo   18:02
Wow, did that come from a professor that didn't even come from the sales guy?
Hey, what the hell happened?
Yeah.

Shawn Lewenza   18:11
What we have some expertise in at least some of those areas, right? But.

Jeff Violo   18:15
Well, well, interesting enough.
It's, it seems to be like an A misunderstood problem, right?
So yeah, you have to almost make proclamations.
You almost have to say you know.
Yeah, there's a lot of unknown unknowns.
There's a lot of known unknowns and how do we get from those to a place where we're feeling secure, that the oil sands providers can release this safely into the environment and ****, you know, nobody's an expert in that right now.
So yeah, we do have to make some proclamations and you've studied enough, but there's still more to be known, right?

Greg Saunders   18:51
8.

Jeff Violo   18:52
So you know, if we can get engagements like that just to help help the oil sands providers help the regulators understand the problem, you know.

Shawn Lewenza   19:02
Well, it might be just.
It might be an issue of just talking about something that they just generally don't like to talk about.

Greg Saunders   19:07
Sorry.

Shawn Lewenza   19:08
Like I've tried to tell you that how they they don't like to.

Jeff Violo   19:11
Yeah.

Shawn Lewenza   19:13
They're working on it, for example, but they don't even want to be acknowledged in our papers.
So they it's The Dirty word.
And so if you bring it more to the surface, it could have the effect of just awareness.

Jeff Violo   19:27
So I understand why they don't wanna be cause you know, it's all about how will this impact shareholder value, right?
So if this becomes more and more evident, this liability is on the books.
Guaranteed the oil the oil sands providers don't want this to be known.
They're like, let's bury this as long as we can, because if this becomes a bigger issue or let's bury it until we have a solution and this is where the whole remediation conversation comes into play, how can we accelerate the remediation?
So at least if it becomes evident that they have this liability, which is, you know, freaking acres of tailings ponds full of ethanoic acid, that could be detrimental to the environment A they won't get an agreement in place with the regulator, right?
So the it's just going to be a liability that's considered in the books.
But if they say yes, this is a problem, but we have a remediation plan in place and we believe this will get us to the point where we can stay fully release this into the, into the environment.
It's gonna be a a.
A lower impact on their stock price and and if you wanna talk about the oil and gas sector, that's that's the whole driver, right.
If you start to look at what they're what their driver is to do, anything, it's how can we secure our shareholder value?
So and I think we could build a bit of a case about that.

Shawn Lewenza   21:02
Yes, I'm looking on there.
Well, I'm not gonna go into that distraction, but I I think there's.
Well, I OK the list.
I'm just going to get back to the list.
I'll.
I'll. I'll.
I'll work on that.
On the weekend or by the weekend.

Jeff Violo   21:23
Yeah, another another good buddy of mine has two guys with the Alberta energy regulator.
He's got two close friends.
Who he went to school with, and I think that they may be interesting contacts.
I haven't got there.
I haven't got the introduction yet, but Scott was asking me to put together a bit of A1 pager about who we are and what we do and why we wanna meet with these guys.
So that's gonna be in another good contact cause I think spending some time with the people in the regulators, AR and stuff like that would be would be helpful.

Shawn Lewenza   21:57
Yeah.
I mean, right now I'm looking at data where the ER publishes around the corral wetland, cause the curl had a a curl is the property of curl oil sands of imperial, and they had a leak in 2023.

Jeff Violo   22:09
Yep.

Shawn Lewenza   22:12
So there was a lot of testing going on and I'm seeing all this data that they're releasing.
I'll probably send you guys one just so you can see it.
It might not be that useful, but there's like there's up until this year, they're showing results of some tests.
So it would be good to figure out who's who's in charge of the NA.
Part of that from an ER.

Jeff Violo   22:34
Hmm.

Shawn Lewenza   22:40
And there are also looking at things like metals.
Zinc, silver.
Um, aluminum?

Jeff Violo   22:53
Is selenium not an issue up there?
Cause I know it is in the like right now, Alberta is going through a a big debate about the coal mining in.

Greg Saunders   23:00
It.

Jeff Violo   23:05
Down in in the crows nest there our governments, just they, they stopped any coal mining for anybody else.
But because there's this Australian mining company that's already had a plan in place, it sounds like they're gonna green light that and there's some massive problems with selenium in the and they also hands or sorry in the in the coal, coal mining there could be catastrophic for that whole area there but is.

Greg Saunders   23:23
Right.

Shawn Lewenza   23:27
Call my.

Greg Saunders   23:29
Cancel.
Well, kind of already already has been for the crows nest, right?
Like it's just a disaster.

Jeff Violo   23:39
Yeah, but you know, our UCP government doesn't seem to have any concerns about environmental type things.
So it's it is a disaster.

Shawn Lewenza   23:53
This.
Yeah, I I'm.
I'm not familiar with selenium and tailings ponds.

Greg Saunders   23:56
She got all that.

Jeff Violo   24:00
Yeah, I know.
I was just more curious about the other organic materials cause you're good at the organic side of things, right?

Shawn Lewenza   24:07
Yeah, but like the, the idea would be, if you're gonna be the one stop naphthenic acid sort of consultant or place to go.

Jeff Violo   24:17
Yep.

Shawn Lewenza   24:20
Having other analytical tools to look at all the things that they're interested in would also be out like a future.
So then you have more cat, you have a chemist and do all the using.
Pretty simple methods to look at metals for example.

Jeff Violo   24:35
Hmm.
So I think the big thing there, Sean, is that that's gonna be your area of expertise as far as service development.
Like if we if you if we could build that in and become the one stop shop like I I guess I want us to be considered expertise in everything we do.
But if there's other areas that are just kind of like A and adelong, sure I'm.
I'm all for that.
And Greg, I don't know if you feel the same way, but I think that'd be great.

Greg Saunders   25:10
The.
100%.

Jeff Violo   25:14
I think we just need to make sure we got a focus on what we do so we can articulate it and people know how to engage us.

Shawn Lewenza   25:15
It wouldn't be.
Yeah, I'm thinking about down the road, but like it's standard kind of chemistry, it's just more offering.

Jeff Violo   25:22
So.

Shawn Lewenza   25:31
More than one service to attract people, they're like, tell us all.
Tell us about the whole water chemistry, not just the NA.

Jeff Violo   25:42
Is, but is there other water chemistries that are as a known as anaise?
Or is there some that are fairly well known?
You know what I mean?
Like like it sounds to me like metals is a fairly well known area like and well covered off or is.

Shawn Lewenza   26:00
I think they know what's in there and they they know what they like when you.

Greg Saunders   26:00
I.

Shawn Lewenza   26:04
There's standard an analytical process to look at.
Handful of criteria.

Greg Saunders   26:08
Yeah.

Shawn Lewenza   26:10
They know what they're looking for.
It's pretty complex, but I would say it's more complex than most water like.

Jeff Violo   26:20
Hello.

Shawn Lewenza   26:21
Not it's more complex than a municipal wastewater.

Jeff Violo   26:29
Hmm.

Greg Saunders   26:31
It's.

Jeff Violo   26:36
OK.
Well, we got lots to think about for the next week.
Um, I think we got it.
I I think what we want to have as a goal out of next week's meeting is like, OK, if you can get that list of contacts, obviously we gotta come together and sort of come to an agreement in regards to sort of, you know, corporate structure, how we're coming together, what our plan is and that.

Shawn Lewenza   27:00
Well, I think, Greg, what you're Greg, you're actually saying you want another time, some more time off.
So I'm not expecting you to come up with a big draft of that plan next week.

Greg Saunders   27:09
Like I can make some headway towards that, but yeah, I I think I need to take most of this week off.

Jeff Violo   27:14
Oh yeah.

Shawn Lewenza   27:14
Yeah, and.

Jeff Violo   27:14
No, no, I I I'm not saying we we're gonna be ready.

Greg Saunders   27:15
Yeah.

Jeff Violo   27:17
But these are things that we wanna start discussing.
And then maybe if we're thinking like the like this, let us, let's have this as a week of thinking, right?
But when we kind of roll in, I kind of think, you know, let's start to get focused.
So we're kind of moving forward and getting to a place where we can actually start to to build this out and and start talking to people, right, more, more than anything, I'd like to just start talking to people.
So cause that's gonna really help us sort of craft and and design what it is that we do and and how we do it, figure out some pricing models, figure out how we build people and make money and make profit and all that kind of stuff so.

Shawn Lewenza   27:55
Well, all those to do items are kind of fairly well described in them.
The Obsidian documents that you guys have started on.

Jeff Violo   28:04
100% Yep, but it's now time to get going on it.

Greg Saunders   28:04
Move.

Jeff Violo   28:08
I guess that's what.
That's what I wanna do so.

Shawn Lewenza   28:11
I know, but back to Greg's original point is we have to come to a final like we'll have to have a a final cook agreement and commitment on everyone's part, and it's really clear.

Jeff Violo   28:20
Yep.

Shawn Lewenza   28:22
But I can tell you're I know that you're chomping at the bit to to do some research, so I will.
I won't with old anymore.
I'll get the list to you, cause it'll be more than enough for you to just, like, satisfy your your initial kind of research inquiries.

Jeff Violo   28:37
Hmm.

Shawn Lewenza   28:42
Yeah, but I've enjoyed the time off too.

Jeff Violo   28:42
Cool.

Shawn Lewenza   28:44
Just doing nothing.
Yeah.
And I I wished I had more time off.

Greg Saunders   28:50
The.

Jeff Violo   28:51
Yeah, I was kind of chomping at the bit, but I've got my son for the week, so it's actually gonna be better cause I need from now until Sunday.
So yeah, he's it's preoccupying.
When I got him so this would be good for me to actually have the the week as well.

Greg Saunders   29:05
It's.
Hey.
Alright.

Shawn Lewenza   29:13
By your your um, is Zach still there or is he gone back?

Greg Saunders   29:17
No, Zach.
Zach went to North Carolina on Boxing Day and he's there until I think he's there until after New Years.

Shawn Lewenza   29:25
That the swing dancing thing.

Greg Saunders   29:27
Yeah, there's a big there's kind of a like, an annual swing dance thing.
And in Asheville, North North Carolina, he's been going there for the last few years, so.

Shawn Lewenza   29:38
Didn't Asheville get disrupted by the?

Greg Saunders   29:41
It did, yeah.
It they it was, yeah.
It got hammered with that hurricane a few months back, but apparently, like it doesn't.
It hasn't negatively affected their their event, so.
Yeah.

Jeff Violo   29:56
He's not gonna meet some girl from North Carolina.
Now is he?

Greg Saunders   29:59
He's got a girlfriend, apparently she's a she's a she does.

Jeff Violo   30:01
He's got another girlfriend already.

Greg Saunders   30:04
She's a torontonian from Ottawa from Ottawa, living in Toronto.

Jeff Violo   30:06

She's a swing dancer too, yes.

Jeff Violo   30:17
Oh, there we go.
Do you know what zachs?
Not really.
The swing dancing.
He just knows that there's a good, solid network of chicks to meet.
It's a smart kid.

Shawn Lewenza   30:29
It is a good plan, like it's really good plan for that.

Greg Saunders   30:34
Yeah, I don't know what the strategy is.
Anyway, he's been doing it for a long time, so yeah.

Shawn Lewenza   30:39
I just don't know how he ended up your kid ending up a swing dancer.

Greg Saunders   30:47
I don't know either.
Ohhhhh God.

Shawn Lewenza   30:52
I mean, I can see all of the outdoor stuff that he does, the climbing in the mountaineering and what not, but.

Greg Saunders   30:54
