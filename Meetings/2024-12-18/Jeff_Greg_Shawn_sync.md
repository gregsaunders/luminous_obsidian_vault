c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/1328-1

<v Greg Saunders>new vault.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/1334-0

<v Greg Saunders>Kind of.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/1348-0

<v Greg Saunders>project.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/1383-0

<v Greg Saunders>Again, it's really it's really depends on like what what's</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/1383-1

<v Greg Saunders>actually happening like we use Obsidian to actually manage</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/1383-2

<v Greg Saunders>documentation and user and developer documentation for</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/1383-3

<v Greg Saunders>software projects.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/1385-0

<v Greg Saunders>Right.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/1409-0

<v Greg Saunders>And then we will publish this all this content to a kind of</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/1409-1

<v Greg Saunders>like a wiki or like a website, right?</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/1457-0

<v Greg Saunders>That but we use Obsidian the manage the content and edit the</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/1457-1

<v Greg Saunders>content, and then we publish it kind of to a static website so</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/1457-2

<v Greg Saunders>people can view it it and yeah, so we do that.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/1461-0

<v Shawn Lewenza>I could all kinds of applications if I got people.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/1511-0

<v Shawn Lewenza>Engage, because like writing a manuscript and a person doesn't</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/1511-1

<v Shawn Lewenza>experiment and they list their protocol in here, and then the</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/1511-2

<v Shawn Lewenza>next week they've edited the protocol and they've done</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/1499-0

<v Greg Saunders>Yeah.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/1511-3

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/1533-0

<v Shawn Lewenza>And then I have it all documented, so I don't have to</v>

<v Shawn Lewenza>later ask them after six months.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/2329-1

<v Greg Saunders>manage all that information and I and I've yet to find something</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/2329-2

<v Greg Saunders>that is, as once you get comfortable with the tool that</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/2329-3

<v Greg Saunders>is so friction free.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/2370-0

<v Greg Saunders>E as this tool is this, this tool seems to have very, very</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/2370-1

<v Greg Saunders>little friction, so it's very easy to use it as your daily</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/2370-2

<v Greg Saunders>driver because it's just like it's just ******* text</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/2370-3

<v Greg Saunders>documents.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/2422-1

<v Greg Saunders>stuff, but kind of the Obsidian is kind of like the thing that</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/2422-2

<v Greg Saunders>brings it all together.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/2434-0

<v Shawn Lewenza>Yeah, I'm even looking at my thing now.</v>

<v Jeff Violo>Yeah, you can create your own personal vaults, right?</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/2535-0

<v Jeff Violo>So you can have a vault outside, right?</v>

<v Greg Saunders>Yeah, I really recommend like watching thing is like some time</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/2617-0

<v Jeff Violo>And understanding the markdown language as well.</v>

<v Greg Saunders>and some YouTube videos and.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/2616-0

<v Shawn Lewenza>I.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/2668-0

<v Shawn Lewenza>Even if I'm using it and I'm cause I take notes for all my</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/2668-1

<v Shawn Lewenza>meetings so I don't know my students to take notes unless I</v>

<v Greg Saunders>Yeah.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/2668-2

<v Shawn Lewenza>a record and then transcribe and then I'm then I wouldn't even</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/2668-3

<v Shawn Lewenza>need to take notes.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/2679-0

<v Shawn Lewenza>But I can share it with them and they don't.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/2695-0

<v Shawn Lewenza>They're participating on a far lesser extent than I am.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/2702-0

<v Shawn Lewenza>If I'm just doing the bulk of the work.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/2713-0

<v Shawn Lewenza>Because I have these people, I don't.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/2718-0

<v Jeff Violo>100% like.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/2740-0

<v Shawn Lewenza>I had a student tried to tell me he was an inventor of my patent</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/2740-1

<v Shawn Lewenza>and I was like no, you're not.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/2755-0

<v Shawn Lewenza>And and and there was no like I was tracing emails and stuff.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/2796-0

<v Shawn Lewenza>If I had this four years ago, I would have had a vault called</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/2796-1

<v Shawn Lewenza>the X and it would have been filled with all the email</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/2796-2

<v Shawn Lewenza>correspondence that I would have just locked down my if I had a</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/2796-3

<v Shawn Lewenza>legal case.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/2802-0

<v Shawn Lewenza>Oh, what a destroyer.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/2821-0

<v Jeff Violo>You're a student.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/2837-0

<v Jeff Violo>That was trying to take credit for your patent.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/2841-0

<v Jeff Violo>I guess that stuff happens, eh?</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/2846-0

<v Shawn Lewenza>Yeah, the guy.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/2868-1

<v Shawn Lewenza>but it's OK now.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/2878-0

<v Shawn Lewenza>It's like it hasn't really affected me.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/2880-0

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/2923-0

<v Greg Saunders>I just again, just going back to the like this vault being backed</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/2923-1

<v Greg Saunders>up, if if you were just to go command P OHS, I don't think you</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/2923-2

<v Greg Saunders>have the, you might not have the git.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/2932-0

<v Greg Saunders>Anyway, it's all being backed up to a git.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/2936-0

<v Shawn Lewenza>Where do you?</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/2953-0

<v Shawn Lewenza>Oh, you have to pick a location to start a new folder.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/2955-0

<v Greg Saunders>Yeah.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/2957-0

<v Greg Saunders>Well, yes.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/2968-0

<v Shawn Lewenza>I don't like this icon.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/2969-0

<v Greg Saunders>Like you can have.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/2979-0

<v Greg Saunders>You can put it anywhere you want.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/2992-0

<v Greg Saunders>It can be a folder anywhere on your on your machine.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/3005-0

<v Greg Saunders>It doesn't matter where it is.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/3006-0

<v Shawn Lewenza>Where is the other?</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/3018-0

<v Jeff Violo>So, so, Sean, what this is is Saint.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/3014-0

<v Shawn Lewenza>Oh no.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/3031-0

<v Jeff Violo>So you actually have local files and folders on your machine.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/3054-0

<v Jeff Violo>Greg has them on his I have them on mine and Greg backs it up to</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/3039-0

<v Shawn Lewenza>Yeah.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/3054-1

<v Jeff Violo>get.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/3079-0

<v Jeff Violo>But if you wanna set up your own personal one, it just basically</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/3079-1

<v Jeff Violo>sets up the files and folders on your machine, right?</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/3100-0

<v Jeff Violo>So it's a local copy of, it's not on the cloud.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/3108-0

<v Shawn Lewenza>Yeah, yeah.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/3122-0

<v Jeff Violo>Now I do my stuff on iCloud, so I do have it backed up because</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/3122-1

<v Jeff Violo>I'm an Apple user.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/3161-0

<v Jeff Violo>They say that they don't necessarily like it, backed up</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/3161-1

<v Jeff Violo>to a cloud service, but it seems to work pretty decent on I</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/3161-2

<v Jeff Violo>cloud, but you can just save it right on your machine if you</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/3161-3

<v Jeff Violo>want to.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/3178-0

<v Jeff Violo>If your machine is backed up, your your good to go.</v>

<v Shawn Lewenza>Yeah.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/3191-0

<v Shawn Lewenza>I just haven't chose folder because I haven't created one</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/3191-1

<v Shawn Lewenza>yet, so that's why.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/3208-0

<v Shawn Lewenza>I have so many questions, but we'll probably have to save them</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/3208-1

<v Shawn Lewenza>for another date.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/3458-0

<v Shawn Lewenza>While students are done, but they don't technically close</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/3458-1

<v Shawn Lewenza>down until a day or two before Christmas, and we're pretty</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/3458-2

<v Shawn Lewenza>generous around Christmas time.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/3480-0

<v Shawn Lewenza>Give people a break so I don't have a lot of meeting, one of</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/3480-1

<v Shawn Lewenza>them said they'll be working.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/3486-0

<v Shawn Lewenza>The other one who knows?</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/3509-0

<v Shawn Lewenza>I can always bother them and not feel too guilty about it, but</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/3509-1

<v Shawn Lewenza>generally I have my meetings Monday.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/3517-0

<v Greg Saunders>I don't care me like Monday morning, Monday afternoon.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/3520-0

<v Greg Saunders>Doesn't matter to me.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/3531-0

<v Jeff Violo>I've I've got availability tomorrow.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/3534-0

<v Jeff Violo>And the next day.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/3551-0

<v Jeff Violo>But I'm just gonna continue playing around and stuff like</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/3551-1

<v Jeff Violo>that with my thoughts.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/3588-0

<v Jeff Violo>But you know, Sean, if you wanna go through my folder under</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/3588-1

<v Jeff Violo>journal and start to look at a bunch of the stuff that I'm</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/3588-2

<v Jeff Violo>doing, I'm stabbing a bunch of stuff out.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/3596-0

<v Jeff Violo>Um, and eventually you're.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/3604-0

<v Jeff Violo>I'm gonna require some feedback from you.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/3623-0

<v Jeff Violo>I'm gonna require some feedback from Greg, but it's all sort of</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/3623-1

<v Jeff Violo>business plan type stuff.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/3677-0

<v Jeff Violo>Um, we set up a thing called the Ardoq meta model where I kind of</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/3677-1

<v Jeff Violo>populated that very much to kind of it's it's almost like kind of</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/3677-2

<v Jeff Violo>a a framework to follow like a playbook for for setting up a</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/3677-3

<v Jeff Violo>company and and certain things you want to do.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/3692-0

<v Jeff Violo>So it's kind of a framework that we can start to follow, so.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/3705-0

<v Greg Saunders>Yeah, that, that, I don't know if you've looked.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/3696-0

<v Shawn Lewenza>OK.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/3712-0

<v Greg Saunders>Did you look at it at all?</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/3777-0

<v Greg Saunders>So cause I think I may have flipped it you at one point, but</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/3777-1

<v Greg Saunders>it's a lot of information, but it's um, it's worth Jeff, where</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/3777-2

<v Greg Saunders>is that one, that one kind of visual that actually just that</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/3777-3

<v Greg Saunders>shows the meta model kind of in that one that one visual like do</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/3777-4

<v Greg Saunders>we have that somewhere?</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/3767-0

<v Shawn Lewenza>You.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/3775-0

<v Shawn Lewenza>You sent me about.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/3781-0

<v Jeff Violo>Actually open up.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/3787-0

<v Shawn Lewenza>Got it?</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/3794-0

<v Jeff Violo>Here I'll show you where I have it.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/3798-0

<v Greg Saunders>Like.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/3800-0

<v Jeff Violo>I'll share my screen.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/3814-0

<v Jeff Violo>Hang on a SEC, OK.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/3818-0

<v Greg Saunders>I did send you that to you, right, Sean?</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/3822-0

<v Shawn Lewenza>Um, I think so.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/3833-0

<v Shawn Lewenza>What's it called again? Meta.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/3838-0

<v Jeff Violo>Meta model.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/3844-0

<v Greg Saunders>Our doctor RER.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/3895-0

<v Greg Saunders>DODOQARDO Q2 and it's the model I probably sent you like a 20</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/3895-1

<v Greg Saunders>page PDF, but there's one particular one particular slide</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/3895-2

<v Greg Saunders>in there that if it was the only thing you looked at, you would</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/3895-3

<v Greg Saunders>probably get 90% of what what the document references.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/3911-0

<v Greg Saunders>Or you put it in the vault, Jeff.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/3919-0

<v Shawn Lewenza>You did send it to me.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/3934-0

<v Jeff Violo>Well, I did some of it, but I I kind of took it back and I broke</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/3934-1

<v Jeff Violo>it down, so.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/3939-0

<v Jeff Violo>Oh yeah.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/3947-0

<v Jeff Violo>Here's the battle battle here, so.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/3974-0

<v Greg Saunders>But do you have you know, you know what I'm talking about,</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/3967-0

<v Jeff Violo>He goes in and it simply goes.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/3974-1

<v Greg Saunders>right?</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/3972-0

<v Jeff Violo>Here's the meta model.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/3983-0

<v Jeff Violo>Then you start to look at this.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/3992-0

<v Jeff Violo>You got the business ecosystem.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/3998-0

<v Jeff Violo>So this is how they break it down.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/4005-0

<v Jeff Violo>So this I broke it down.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/4015-0

<v Jeff Violo>This is the introduction of the meta model.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/4036-0

<v Jeff Violo>This is what I met him model is.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/4041-0

<v Greg Saunders>No, no, Jeff, but but, but Jeff, there's that one, does that one?</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/4080-0

<v Greg Saunders>There's that one visual that kind of like gives you that</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/4080-1

<v Greg Saunders>50,000 foot view of all of this, like this gets too much into the</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/4063-0

<v Jeff Violo>Yeah.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/4072-0

<v Jeff Violo>Give me a SEC.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/4079-0

<v Jeff Violo>Yeah, I think it's.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/4080-2

<v Greg Saunders>weeds, that one.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/4085-0

<v Greg Saunders>Oh yeah.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/4088-0

<v Greg Saunders>What was that?</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/4094-0

<v Greg Saunders>Sorry, go back.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/4104-0

<v Jeff Violo>No, it's not that cause that's just the layers.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/4137-0

<v Jeff Violo>Well, they took the this one is me is thinking about.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/4131-0

<v Shawn Lewenza>Well, I see the PDF I I I think I have it.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/4142-0

<v Shawn Lewenza>Is it called the meta model?</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/4144-0

<v Jeff Violo>Yeah.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/4150-0

<v Greg Saunders>Probably.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/4165-0

<v Jeff Violo>So what I did is I took that out and we basically went through</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/4165-1

<v Jeff Violo>the domains and components so.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/4189-0

<v Jeff Violo>So we have business capabilities, strategy and</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/4189-1

<v Jeff Violo>objectives and it explains what that strategy objective is.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/4228-0

<v Jeff Violo>And then I've got luminous strategies, luminous objectives,</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/4228-1

<v Jeff Violo>luminous, you know, ideas and initiatives, different things</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/4223-0

<v Greg Saunders>So you can you can think about.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/4228-2

<v Jeff Violo>like that, so.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/4278-0

<v Greg Saunders>So one of the one of the analogies I've been I've been</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/4278-1

<v Greg Saunders>using with this is that you can think about it as like paint by</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/4278-2

<v Greg Saunders>number, like we're gonna use the meta model to create like a</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/4278-3

<v Greg Saunders>picture, like a like a a picture of luminous.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/4290-0

<v Greg Saunders>And it's just gonna be a bunch of outlines.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/4306-0

<v Shawn Lewenza>So you guys can go ahead.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/4298-0

<v Greg Saunders>And there are.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/4319-0

<v Greg Saunders>And then our job is to colour that metamodel in over over</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/4319-1

<v Greg Saunders>overtime, right?</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/4357-0

<v Greg Saunders>But it's kind of like this framework to say these are all</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/4357-1

<v Greg Saunders>the domains that you need to be thinking about and how these</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/4357-2

<v Greg Saunders>different domains interact with each other, more or less in any</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/4357-3

<v Greg Saunders>business.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/4383-0

<v Greg Saunders>It's and then you kind of just fine tune that and you start</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/4383-1

<v Greg Saunders>colouring the picture in over over a period of time.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/4399-0

<v Greg Saunders>Ultimately forms the basis for business plans and all kinds of</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/4399-1

<v Greg Saunders>stuff.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/4404-0

<v Shawn Lewenza>No, I get it.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/4411-0

<v Shawn Lewenza>It's pretty it's extremely powerful.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/4429-0

<v Shawn Lewenza>I am so low tech when it comes to these kind of management</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/4429-1

<v Shawn Lewenza>things.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/4437-0

<v Shawn Lewenza>I just was gonna comment.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/4450-0

<v Shawn Lewenza>You do like the name seemed well, you've adopted this name.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/4453-0

<v Shawn Lewenza>Luminous.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/4458-0

<v Shawn Lewenza>It's it's.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/4483-0

<v Shawn Lewenza>It could be easily changed I'm sure, but I kind of feel like</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/4483-1

<v Shawn Lewenza>that's another thing and wouldn't mind finalizing like is</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/4483-2

<v Shawn Lewenza>that a?</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/4494-0

<v Shawn Lewenza>Should I spend more time working on different possibilities or?</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/4521-0

<v Greg Saunders>Well, I like the name, but I mean I guess that that's that's</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/4521-1

<v Greg Saunders>alternately up to you.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/4535-0

<v Jeff Violo>I did share with Tara and Tara liked it and terrorists.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/4526-0

<v Shawn Lewenza>OK.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/4540-0

<v Shawn Lewenza>I like it too.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/4545-0

<v Jeff Violo>Pretty fickle terror is very fickle, right?</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/4551-0

<v Jeff Violo>So so.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/4549-0

<v Shawn Lewenza>Yeah.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/4554-0

<v Shawn Lewenza>Luminous biosolutions.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/4569-0

<v Shawn Lewenza>We spend some time thinking about it seven or eight years</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/4569-1

<v Shawn Lewenza>ago.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/4572-0

<v Greg Saunders>OK.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/5679-0

<v Greg Saunders>So uh yeah, I created a folder called infrastructure and inside</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/5667-0

<v Shawn Lewenza>Yeah, I see it.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/5679-1

<v Greg Saunders>of Infrastructure I created a file called domains and there is</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/5679-2

<v Greg Saunders>the following.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/5700-0

<v Greg Saunders>I've registered domains and that list right now, OK.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/5708-0

<v Shawn Lewenza>We should put the passwords and all this **** to access that in</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/5708-1

<v Shawn Lewenza>there too.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/5729-0

<v Shawn Lewenza>We we sorted through that I think, OK.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/5720-0

<v Greg Saunders>Yeah.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/5737-0

<v Greg Saunders>Separately, though, we're gonna have like a like a a shared</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/5737-1

<v Greg Saunders>password service.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/5749-0

<v Greg Saunders>Like we won't put passwords in the vault.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/5755-0

<v Shawn Lewenza>OK.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/5752-0

<v Greg Saunders>We'll actually have it.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/5758-0

<v Greg Saunders>Have a secure password service.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/5771-0

<v Greg Saunders>Um, like what?</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/5773-0

<v Shawn Lewenza>Which one do you use?</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/5781-0

<v Greg Saunders>We we use a for our team.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/5801-0

<v Greg Saunders>We use a service called 1 password and it allows us to</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/5793-0

<v Shawn Lewenza>Yeah.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/5801-1

<v Greg Saunders>like create like organized like organizations and then.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/5813-0

<v Greg Saunders>And Project associated with particular projects and we can.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/5832-0

<v Greg Saunders>It's probably better to do that right from the beginning versus</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/5832-1

<v Greg Saunders>like we waited too long to do it.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/5868-0

<v Greg Saunders>And then we're still kind of cleaning up our mess because we</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/5868-1

<v Greg Saunders>all have our own password managers and now we're trying to</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/5868-2

<v Greg Saunders>get everything into this shared vault.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/5870-0

<v Greg Saunders>This shared password vault.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/5880-0

<v Greg Saunders>To start, do it right from the beginning.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/5883-0

<v Greg Saunders>It's much better.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/5887-0

<v Greg Saunders>Yeah.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/5900-0

<v Jeff Violo>I think I broke my index.</v>

<v Greg Saunders>Yeah.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/5955-0

<v Jeff Violo>Does it break the index or does the index follow everything?</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/5951-0

<v Shawn Lewenza>Right.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/5960-0

<v Jeff Violo>Jesus, the index still works.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/5979-0

<v Greg Saunders>But it'll it'll follow the links, the links will get</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/6143-0

<v Greg Saunders>What we're more, more, more and more frequent contacts, so we</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/6143-1

<v Greg Saunders>can just follow it, make sure it's actually gonna work if you</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/6152-0

<v Jeff Violo>The only the only thing that I'm trying to determine is the</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/6143-2

<v Greg Saunders>want.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/6165-0

<v Shawn Lewenza>OK.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/6152-1

<v Jeff Violo>difference between the docket clearing and the discussions</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/6152-2

<v Jeff Violo>cause I could see myself using the docket.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/6151-0

<v Greg Saunders>So.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/6176-0

<v Jeff Violo>If there's anything that I want, Shawn or Greg to do, or even</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/6176-1

<v Jeff Violo>myself put sort of timelines and then we have projects.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/6217-0

<v Jeff Violo>So the only thing that I'm gonna get confused about is why don't</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/6217-1

<v Jeff Violo>we using a project when are we using Doc and clearing and when</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/6217-2

<v Jeff Violo>we using discussions they're they're all good but.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/6231-0

<v Greg Saunders>Yeah, I I it it it can get out of hand if we're not careful.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/6262-0

<v Greg Saunders>So like I would think about docket clearing as like I need</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/6262-1

<v Greg Saunders>to like I need a mechanism to draw your attention to</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/6262-2

<v Greg Saunders>something.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/6267-0

<v Greg Saunders>Maybe it's not a conversation.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/6297-0

<v Greg Saunders>Maybe I just like for example I created this file called domains</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/6297-1

<v Greg Saunders>or I've got a list of all the five domains we registered.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/6293-0

<v Shawn Lewenza>Yeah.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/6316-0

<v Greg Saunders>Maybe I just wanna put on a note on the docket clearing that.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/6333-0

<v Greg Saunders>Hey, I just want to let you guys know that's what I did right.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/6350-0

<v Greg Saunders>So it's not really a discussion that's more like an FYI.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/6387-0

<v Greg Saunders>That's what I would think could clearing As for as more of like</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/6387-1

<v Greg Saunders>an FYI, just to keep each, just keep each other in the loop.</v>

c93485a2-e692-4f9f-ab5b-5cfd3a3e33a8/6412-0

<v Greg Saunders>Um project, the project's part would be more like I have a I</v>
