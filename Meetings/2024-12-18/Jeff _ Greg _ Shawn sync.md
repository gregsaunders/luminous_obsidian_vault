Shawn Lewenza   0:04
Meetings.
No.

Greg Saunders   0:07
This put the trans the transcription for the meeting, like in in this meet I'll create a full folder for every meeting we have and I'll just put the transcription in that folder.
So we've got a text transcription of the meeting and then we can search it.

Shawn Lewenza   0:17
OK.

Greg Saunders   0:20
We can run it through AI, we can summarize it.
We can do all kinds of crap with it.

Shawn Lewenza   0:25
Wow.
You know how often stuff gets lost from a lab meeting conversation that I have every week all the ******* time.

Greg Saunders   0:32
Yeah.
So I actually here I gotta show you something that's actually pretty.
We do this quite frequently, so I had a meeting with.
I mean we we we yeah, when was was it my last meeting with Mark?

Jeff Violo   0:43
Mark, yeah.

Shawn Lewenza   0:47
You can you show me how to do that at some point, record a meeting and translate it.

Jeff Violo   0:48
Yeah.

Shawn Lewenza   0:51
Cause I could do it in other teams meetings.

Greg Saunders   0:54
You have to have a subscription to copilot, which is like.
I think it's a $500 a year like license.

Shawn Lewenza   1:00
OK.

Greg Saunders   1:02
So if you've got copilot, you can you can do that.

Shawn Lewenza   1:10
Yeah.

Greg Saunders   1:12
Yeah.
So yeah, so it's it's it's recording and transcribing this meeting now.
So anyway, I'm a good example of why this is really useful.
Ball is uh Mark.
Typically we can find already.
Take care of see Monday.
Where the hell?

Shawn Lewenza   1:31
Yeah.

Greg Saunders   1:32
Ohhhhh.
Where was that mark?
Oh yeah.
OK, so here we go.
So I had a meeting with.
Mark A Monday um I I recorded the meeting.
So now that the meetings recorded right so that you can see here like the meeting started.
I Greg started read the record.
The meeting meeting ended.
Now I've got the meeting recording here.
If I click on view recap, what it's gonna do is.
See these bite like.
First of all, here's the transcription.
So this is this is the actual.
Like ******* me, blah blah blah.

Shawn Lewenza   2:17
Oh, you know what?
I might have access to that.
I might have access that transcription through the AU, cause they recorded meetings all the time.

Greg Saunders   2:21
Yeah.
Probably, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, I imagine it would.
And then yeah, so the and you can you can generate a summary, you can actually ask you can ask this question, you can ask it questions.

Shawn Lewenza   2:34
Damn.

Greg Saunders   2:35
Bright light.
Like where is um?
Copilot, if I open U code pilot I can ask the meeting question like what was one of the things we talked about.
Um.

Shawn Lewenza   2:57
Dockets, tasks.

Greg Saunders   3:00
No.
And then this meeting I had on Monday with Mark.
I'm just trying to remember.
Like, what are cherries?
Alright.
Maybe.
Hopefully it's on Copresident ******** the bed anyway, so I'm.
I'm I'm asking.
I'm asking the AI.

Shawn Lewenza   3:20
Holy ****.

Greg Saunders   3:20
I'm asking the AI to like be and it's reading the transcription and it's pulling the stuff out of the transcription and this is this is.
This is actually this.
This is accurate.
Setting up a dev environment for automation, Vendor Portal work and FIFO and the FIFO implementation.
Um, this is all accurate and like this would actually take me to the.
This would take me to the transcript where and the transcript it it it I I should be going to look so.
Um anyway, yeah.
So point is, yeah, meeting meeting recordings and turn descriptions.
Super, super useful.
Um, yeah.
So when that's going to do so, whenever when we remember when we can, we will just drop a meeting transcription and an AI summary in a folder for each day.

Shawn Lewenza   4:05
The.

Greg Saunders   4:13
Projects what we already know.
What projects is?
That's kind of where we got kind of like we can put all of our project related work.
Temp is garbage templates.
Templates are those.
These are just those templates that I was using.
Don't **** around with these.
These actually are like this is the code that generates those templates.
I was using creating new discussion thread and to create a new who comment and that's it.
Like the rest of us, just garbage is this stuff for for me?
Like like what I've done to look some utilities, but that that's kind of it in a nutshell.

Shawn Lewenza   4:41
OK.

Jeff Violo   4:45
So I'm probably going to move my stuff from under me cause I've got my stuff just under journal under Jeff, but I'll set up a one that's just specific to business development so that I'll get moved over my business stuff, business development.

Shawn Lewenza   4:45
So.

Jeff Violo   5:01
I'll start to organize that and we'll have a business development, um folder moved over there.
It shouldn't be residing underneath me under this point in time, so our journals and our stuff should be, you know, kind of [internal] stuff that we're working on once we move, once we move it over there, it's kind of like alright moving into production.

Shawn Lewenza   5:10
Uh, Greg?

Greg Saunders   5:22
Yeah.
Yeah, you could just as you're flushing ideas out, you could just kind of live in your journal area and then we find it kind of more permanent home for it.
When you're when you're ready, when it's ready, right?
So.
Yeah.
So anyway, we wanted to talk about discussion threads.
That was my proposal.

Shawn Lewenza   5:42
Yeah, that's good.
It's good.
Do you use this system with Obsidian?
With your multiple businesses and projects already, yes, right.
So you're in here all day long.

Greg Saunders   5:54
So the.
Get right now in Obsidian vaults.

Jeff Violo   5:58
So.

Greg Saunders   5:59
Open on my desk like I got I9.

Shawn Lewenza   6:02
How many?
Oh.

Greg Saunders   6:07
Like 9 different balls like I I have a different.

Jeff Violo   6:07
So.

Greg Saunders   6:09
Here's all the vaults that I have like.
I got a personal vault to work.
I gotta work vault, which is not.
It's like not just miscellaneous work stuff.
Nutrition Partners, I've got Bright Village, Obsidian, Menzies, autom PV Nutrition Partners was a client.
Bright Bright Village team stuff.
Nutrition partner documentation vault.
Yeah, I use it all the time.
It's my daily driver for most things and like I just created a new vault.
Kind of.
For every, well, a vault for a company or a vault for a project.
Again, it's really it's really depends on like what what's actually happening like we use Obsidian to actually manage documentation and user and developer documentation for software projects.
Right.
And then we will publish this all this content to a kind of like a wiki or like a website, right?
That but we use Obsidian the manage the content and edit the content, and then we publish it kind of to a static website so people can view it it and yeah, so we do that.

Shawn Lewenza   7:10
I could all kinds of applications if I got people.
Engage, because like writing a manuscript and a person doesn't experiment and they list their protocol in here, and then the next week they've edited the protocol and they've done something different and they keep iterating on it.

Greg Saunders   7:22
Yeah.

Shawn Lewenza   7:26
And then I have it all documented, so I don't have to later ask them after six months.
Oht, can you go back and review all your your processes like it's all there.

Greg Saunders   7:35
Yeah, so here.

Jeff Violo   7:36
Right, yeah.

Greg Saunders   7:37
Here's I'll show you one example that's kind of it's kind of it's it's, it's fresh in my mind cause it's active because we've been working with the this week.

Jeff Violo   7:38
It.

Greg Saunders   7:45
So this is this is that vault I was telling you that we're using.
We have like documentation for a software project.
So, like under your documentation, we've got a number of areas like scale up is a is a component and in in in here is like documentation there's links to videos.
Um, there's probably even some screenshots in here.
Scale up index and maybe not on Mill DB Cooper.
Yeah, like you can put in like this.
Obviously screenshots in here blah blah blah blah, but what's cool about this is so we got lots of content in here infrastructure like you know.
So this is all kind of like documentation about this project, but we're when I see we're publishing this and this is where you might have a use case. Um.
A I'm going to.
There you gotta see this.
This is actually pretty ******* cool.
Um.
So I'm in.
But yeah, OK so.
I'm in the same.
I'm in the same vault.
So this.
See, I'm in this NPI docs folder right now.

Shawn Lewenza   9:16
Hmm.

Greg Saunders   9:19
That is this.
See this NPI docs.
Here I'm in this folder is.

Shawn Lewenza   9:22
Yeah.

Greg Saunders   9:24
So here's the Obsidian vault on the command line.
In that same folder.
Now what I'm going to do is I'm gonna.
I'm gonna publish this Obsidian vault as a static as a static website.
Just give it a second and you can say and this kind of brings it all together and like, how how powerful this this could actually be.
Um.
So here's a website NPI Docs website.
If I went into say user user docs, I want to go to Brillion port.

Shawn Lewenza   9:59
Oh ****.

Greg Saunders   10:03
I wanna look at the brilliant port document.
Brilliant port user guide.
So here's the Brill Import user guide configuration setup.
It's got steps and it's got some screenshots and whatever, but what you're looking at here?
Brilliant import User guide is.
This.
Like this document in my.

Shawn Lewenza   10:28
Yeah, that's awesome.

Greg Saunders   10:28
The Obsidian bolts on this published website and I didn't do anything.
All I did was all I did was do this.

Shawn Lewenza   10:33
And now?

Greg Saunders   10:36
All I did was run this this command basically like.
Basically, MQ docs is another tool, but basically serve this serve everything as serve everything you find in this vault as a website and that's what that's what.

Jeff Violo   10:48
What?
So think of this as an internal company wiki.
This could be your research findings.
This could be research, documentation and and the thing about it is it's now you know it's a, it's a view only website, so nobody can go in and mess around with it or anything like that.

Greg Saunders   10:56
Everything.

Jeff Violo   11:07
You give them access to it.
And if you want to make any changes to the documentation, you just do it in your Obsidian sink it.
It gets pushed up and it's that easy to make changes or pull something away or anything that you need to do right? So.

Greg Saunders   11:24
So yeah, like, but anyway, it's your point, Sean.
If you like, if you're having challenges like bringing a lot of information together into one place, like you end up with spreadsheets here and PDFs there and notes here and a Google Doc and blah blah blah it all over place.

Shawn Lewenza   11:40
******* name, yeah.

Greg Saunders   11:43
You got stuff in emails.
You got stuff in indirect like it becomes really difficult to manage all that information and I and I've yet to find something that is, as once you get comfortable with the tool that is so friction free.
E as this tool is this, this tool seems to have very, very little friction, so it's very easy to use it as your daily driver because it's just like it's just ******* text documents.
And I showed you yesterday like you can you can.
You can bring in other documents like you can drop PDFs in here.
You can have like spreadsheets in here and links to them and stuff, but kind of the Obsidian is kind of like the thing that brings it all together.

Shawn Lewenza   12:29
Yeah, I'm even looking at my thing now.
It's like.
I'm looking at everything in our vault, but how do I get outside of that to create a new vault?
OHP, the vaults at the bottom, called luminous.

Greg Saunders   12:42
Yeah.
So you go down there, click on manage it's vaults, and then you create a new vault.

Jeff Violo   12:43
Yep.

Shawn Lewenza   12:46
But click on what and.

Greg Saunders   12:50
If you go, if you click on manage vaults.

Shawn Lewenza   12:53
Oh.

Jeff Violo   12:56
Yeah, you can create your own personal vaults, right?
So you can have a vault outside, right?

Shawn Lewenza   13:01
Yeah.

Greg Saunders   13:01
Yeah.

Jeff Violo   13:03
There's also some really great Obsidian tutorials on YouTube that you can actually watch, because it's it's the keystrokes and stuff like that that really start to become powerful, right?

Greg Saunders   13:04
Yeah.

Shawn Lewenza   13:07
Yeah, I've started to watch.

Greg Saunders   13:08
Yeah.
Yeah, I really recommend like watching thing is like some time and some YouTube videos and.

Jeff Violo   13:20
And understanding the markdown language as well.

Shawn Lewenza   13:21
I.
Even if I'm using it and I'm cause I take notes for all my meetings so I don't know my students to take notes unless I a record and then transcribe and then I'm then I wouldn't even need to take notes.

Greg Saunders   13:29
Yeah.

Shawn Lewenza   13:35
But I can share it with them and they don't.
They're participating on a far lesser extent than I am.
If I'm just doing the bulk of the work.
Because I have these people, I don't.

Jeff Violo   13:47
100% like.

Shawn Lewenza   13:49
I had a student tried to tell me he was an inventor of my patent and I was like no, you're not.
And and and there was no like I was tracing emails and stuff.
If I had this four years ago, I would have had a vault called the X and it would have been filled with all the email correspondence that I would have just locked down my if I had a legal case.
Oh, what a destroyer.

Greg Saunders   14:15
Um, yeah.

Shawn Lewenza   14:17
OK.
Um, but.

Greg Saunders   14:19
Again, just just, just.

Jeff Violo   14:19
You're a student.
That was trying to take credit for your patent.
I guess that stuff happens, eh?

Shawn Lewenza   14:26
Yeah, the guy.
Yeah, it's kind of a long story, but it it didn't end very well, but it's OK now.
It's like it hasn't really affected me.
He was wrong.

Greg Saunders   14:42
Yeah.
I just again, just going back to the like this vault being backed up, if if you were just to go command P OHS, I don't think you have the, you might not have the git.
Anyway, it's all being backed up to a git.

Shawn Lewenza   14:55
Where do you?
Oh, you have to pick a location to start a new folder.

Greg Saunders   14:59
Yeah.
Well, yes.

Shawn Lewenza   15:03
I don't like this icon.

Greg Saunders   15:04
Like you can have.
You can put it anywhere you want.
It can be a folder anywhere on your on your machine.
It doesn't matter where it is.

Shawn Lewenza   15:13
Where is the other?

Jeff Violo   15:13
So, so, Sean, what this is is Saint.

Shawn Lewenza   15:14
Oh no.

Jeff Violo   15:17
So you actually have local files and folders on your machine.
Greg has them on his I have them on mine and Greg backs it up to get.

Shawn Lewenza   15:22
Yeah.

Jeff Violo   15:26
But if you wanna set up your own personal one, it just basically sets up the files and folders on your machine, right?
So it's a local copy of, it's not on the cloud.

Shawn Lewenza   15:35
Yeah, yeah.

Jeff Violo   15:35
Now I do my stuff on iCloud, so I do have it backed up because I'm an Apple user.
They say that they don't necessarily like it, backed up to a cloud service, but it seems to work pretty decent on I cloud, but you can just save it right on your machine if you want to.
If your machine is backed up, your your good to go.

Shawn Lewenza   15:54
Yeah.
I just haven't chose folder because I haven't created one yet, so that's why.
I have so many questions, but we'll probably have to save them for another date.

Greg Saunders   16:11
Well, it's it's Wednesday one week.
Get together again on Monday and then on between now and Monday.
What I'll do is I'll try to have like a like a a couple, like a a couple of proposals for for structure and then we can talk about them on Monday and then make a decision.
And like alongside that, like we need to, we need to flush out like you know.
Equity and all that kind of stuff, I think we should probably do that on Monday.

Shawn Lewenza   16:42
OK.

Greg Saunders   16:48
Yeah.
So I'm good Monday morning, if you're if you're good Monday morning.

Shawn Lewenza   16:55
I have lab meetings on Monday morning, but not no, I don't have a lab meeting on Monday cause it's holiday. Yeah.

Greg Saunders   17:01
Monday's a holiday.

Shawn Lewenza   17:03
Well, the the people in the lab are slackers, and they're not coming in even though they technically have to.

Greg Saunders   17:09
OK.

Jeff Violo   17:10
Oh, is that right?

Shawn Lewenza   17:13
Well, the university.

Jeff Violo   17:13
So the world doesn't shut down after Friday when all finals are done and everything, and you know doesn't.
Doesn't the universities turn into a pumpkin and just close down or?

Shawn Lewenza   17:19
Also.
While students are done, but they don't technically close down until a day or two before Christmas, and we're pretty generous around Christmas time.
Give people a break so I don't have a lot of meeting, one of them said they'll be working.
The other one who knows?
I can always bother them and not feel too guilty about it, but generally I have my meetings Monday.

Greg Saunders   17:44
I don't care me like Monday morning, Monday afternoon.
Doesn't matter to me.

Jeff Violo   17:51
I've I've got availability tomorrow.
And the next day.
But I'm just gonna continue playing around and stuff like that with my thoughts.
But you know, Sean, if you wanna go through my folder under journal and start to look at a bunch of the stuff that I'm doing, I'm stabbing a bunch of stuff out.
Um, and eventually you're.
I'm gonna require some feedback from you.
I'm gonna require some feedback from Greg, but it's all sort of business plan type stuff.
Um, we set up a thing called the Ardoq meta model where I kind of populated that very much to kind of it's it's almost like kind of a a framework to follow like a playbook for for setting up a company and and certain things you want to do.
So it's kind of a framework that we can start to follow, so.

Greg Saunders   18:39
Yeah, that, that, I don't know if you've looked.

Shawn Lewenza   18:39
OK.

Greg Saunders   18:42
Did you look at it at all?
So cause I think I may have flipped it you at one point, but it's a lot of information, but it's um, it's worth Jeff, where is that one, that one kind of visual that actually just that shows the meta model kind of in that one that one visual like do we have that somewhere?

Shawn Lewenza   18:56
You.
You sent me about.

Jeff Violo   18:57
Actually open up.

Shawn Lewenza   18:58
Got it?

Jeff Violo   18:59
Here I'll show you where I have it.

Greg Saunders   19:00
Like.

Jeff Violo   19:01
I'll share my screen.
Hang on a SEC, OK.

Greg Saunders   19:04
I did send you that to you, right, Sean?

Shawn Lewenza   19:07
Um, I think so.
What's it called again? Meta.

Jeff Violo   19:10
Meta model.

Greg Saunders   19:10
Our doctor RER.
DODOQARDO Q2 and it's the model I probably sent you like a 20 page PDF, but there's one particular one particular slide in there that if it was the only thing you looked at, you would probably get 90% of what what the document references.
Or you put it in the vault, Jeff.

Shawn Lewenza   19:33
You did send it to me.

Jeff Violo   19:34
Well, I did some of it, but I I kind of took it back and I broke it down, so.
Oh yeah.
Here's the battle battle here, so.

Greg Saunders   19:44
But do you have you know, you know what I'm talking about, right?

Jeff Violo   19:45
He goes in and it simply goes.
Here's the meta model.
Then you start to look at this.
You got the business ecosystem.
So this is how they break it down.
So this I broke it down.
This is the introduction of the meta model.
This is what I met him model is.

Greg Saunders   19:56
No, no, Jeff, but but, but Jeff, there's that one, does that one?
There's that one visual that kind of like gives you that 50,000 foot view of all of this, like this gets too much into the weeds, that one.

Jeff Violo   20:05
Yeah.
Give me a SEC.
Yeah, I think it's.

Greg Saunders   20:10
Oh yeah.
What was that?
Sorry, go back.

Jeff Violo   20:14
No, it's not that cause that's just the layers.
Well, they took the this one is me is thinking about.

Shawn Lewenza   20:18
Well, I see the PDF I I I think I have it.
Is it called the meta model?

Jeff Violo   20:23
Yeah.

Greg Saunders   20:24
Probably.

Jeff Violo   20:25
So what I did is I took that out and we basically went through the domains and components so.
So we have business capabilities, strategy and objectives and it explains what that strategy objective is.
And then I've got luminous strategies, luminous objectives, luminous, you know, ideas and initiatives, different things like that, so.

Greg Saunders   20:42
So you can you can think about.
So one of the one of the analogies I've been I've been using with this is that you can think about it as like paint by number, like we're gonna use the meta model to create like a picture, like a like a a picture of luminous.
And it's just gonna be a bunch of outlines.

Shawn Lewenza   21:01
So you guys can go ahead.

Greg Saunders   21:02
And there are.
And then our job is to colour that metamodel in over over overtime, right?
But it's kind of like this framework to say these are all the domains that you need to be thinking about and how these different domains interact with each other, more or less in any business.
It's and then you kind of just fine tune that and you start colouring the picture in over over a period of time.
Ultimately forms the basis for business plans and all kinds of stuff.

Shawn Lewenza   21:34
No, I get it.
It's pretty it's extremely powerful.
I am so low tech when it comes to these kind of management things.
I just was gonna comment.
You do like the name seemed well, you've adopted this name.
Luminous.
It's it's.
It could be easily changed I'm sure, but I kind of feel like that's another thing and wouldn't mind finalizing like is that a?
Should I spend more time working on different possibilities or?

Greg Saunders   21:59
Well, I like the name, but I mean I guess that that's that's alternately up to you.

Jeff Violo   22:04
I did share with Tara and Tara liked it and terrorists.

Shawn Lewenza   22:05
OK.
I like it too.

Jeff Violo   22:08
Pretty fickle terror is very fickle, right?
So so.

Shawn Lewenza   22:11
Yeah.
Luminous biosolutions.
We spend some time thinking about it seven or eight years ago.
I like it.
Um, I'll there's a guy who would who did this work in the lab.
We made the business cards.
I think I told you, but he's now a doctor.
I can't wait to share it with him.
That's actually a company.

Jeff Violo   22:31
So luminous biosolutions, or luminous biotech, like do we wanna have biotech in?
I don't know if that's a good word or not, but.

Shawn Lewenza   22:43
I don't think it needs to be in the in the.

Greg Saunders   22:48
I think I think biotech has a little bit of baggage these days.

Shawn Lewenza   22:51
Yeah it does.

Jeff Violo   22:54
That.

Greg Saunders   22:55
Like uh, yeah.
I mean, for better for worse.
There's some a little bit of the the the IT brings some a little, I don't know, Silicon Valley, yeah, a little Silicon Valley tech bro ******** to the whole thing, right?

Jeff Violo   23:05
Check tech bro. Yeah.

Shawn Lewenza   23:10
I mean the weather, it needs to have two words in the actual like everything could just be referred to as luminous.
But if a technical business name might be two words, but.
OK. OK.
I just started throwing out there.
I'm gonna.
I might spend a little bit of time before Monday to see if there's anything else that really sounds better.

Greg Saunders   23:39
OK.

Shawn Lewenza   23:42
OK.

Greg Saunders   23:43
But sounds good.

Shawn Lewenza   23:47
Luminous.com is a company whereas.
An AI accelerator on a powerful, scalable AI accelerator.
Oh ****.
OK.

Jeff Violo   24:01
Greg, didn't you search out luminous like in secure some URLs like luminous bio solutions or what did you do you not go and find some stuff?

Shawn Lewenza   24:05
Who?
Yeah, we could.
We got some.

Greg Saunders   24:13
Yeah, we registered a few.
A few domain names actually I think I don't remember what they were, but.

Shawn Lewenza   24:19
Yeah, they're in my phone.
You sent me the text of the screenshot of them all.

Greg Saunders   24:23
All all put the I'll drop them in in the vault somewhere.
So we like.
Yeah, I think I even wrote registered your name because you're, I think, just I time I was registering those domains, I noticed that your last name was like available.

Shawn Lewenza   24:28
Yeah.
Yeah.

Greg Saunders   24:38
So I think I just registered it just for just for ***** and getting like it's an unusual to actually have like a like a like a like your name like still a like still available.

Shawn Lewenza   24:40
Yeah.
Yeah, we.

Greg Saunders   24:51
I didn't realize how rare your name was.

Shawn Lewenza   24:54
Yeah, and, um, I wanna keep that and.
And you kept like you've been paying for that.
And I I just want to make sure that, uh, we sort that out and your and just track it.

Greg Saunders   25:06
Yeah.
Like we're gonna have, like, um, like, let's assume we get on the other side of this and where we we find we find some way that we can work together.
Yeah, we're gonna have lots of expenses.
We'll keep track of and we'll just keep.
Just keep track.
Like, let's keep track for our expenses and we'll just submit them.
We'll post them and we'll pay them when there's cash to pay them back, right?

Shawn Lewenza   25:31
That's the part we need to get to get.
Getting that cash rolling in by any means, Jerry.

Greg Saunders   25:35
So yeah, I so Luminate. Yeah.
So luminous biotech.
Dot com.ca was registered. Luminousbiosolutions.ca was registered.
I don't know why.
Oh, did I?

Shawn Lewenza   25:53
Can you drag it into Obsidian?
Or if you got it looking at, you're looking at.

Greg Saunders   25:56
And here, let me just.
I'll just take a quick screen shot.
Um.
This.
I'm just going to stick it in my journal right for now.
On today's?

Shawn Lewenza   26:13
Oh.

Greg Saunders   26:14
Yeah, just on if you just check like to today's date in my journal, you'll you'll see.
I just dropped in the screen shot there.

Shawn Lewenza   26:23
I have too many.

Greg Saunders   26:23
OK.

Shawn Lewenza   26:25
Where do I?
If I now opened up a new one, where would the other journal Bolt be?

Greg Saunders   26:30
Well, if you again if you click on that like down in the lower left corner where it tells you the vault name because you click on, that's gonna give you a list of all bolts. Yeah.

Shawn Lewenza   26:39
Alright. Got it.
Yeah. OK.

Greg Saunders   26:41
Then when you click on the wall you want, it'll take you to the open window, wherever that vault happens to be.

Shawn Lewenza   26:45
OK, OK.

Greg Saunders   26:47
So looks like we.
We registered both luminous biosolutions and luminous biotech as well as your name.

Shawn Lewenza   26:54
Where did you copy that Siri?

Greg Saunders   26:57
It's in.
I just dropped it in my journal on today's date.

Shawn Lewenza   27:01
OK.

Greg Saunders   27:04
The we'll put it somewhere.
I'll.
I'll. I'll.
I'll put it some somewhere else later, like I'll create a we'll have to have, like, somewhere in here where we're keeping track of, like, all like anything, any tech related like services like technology services are using domain names that are registered, all that kind of stuff.
So what?
We eventually have a spot where just keep track of all that, like in will probably have like a.
You know what?
Actually, maybe I'll just do and I could afford it.
Called infrastructure in for a struct.
Sure.
And then under infrastructure, I'll just created a know called for now just called domains.
And then I will just copy.
Um.
OK.
And one.

Jeff Violo   28:01
Were you putting that court?
Oh, there it is. OK.

Greg Saunders   28:06
Yeah.

Shawn Lewenza   28:07
No.
No.

Greg Saunders   28:18
Yeah.
Already copied that.
OK.
So uh yeah, I created a folder called infrastructure and inside of Infrastructure I created a file called domains and there is the following.

Shawn Lewenza   28:32
Yeah, I see it.

Greg Saunders   28:38
I've registered domains and that list right now, OK.

Shawn Lewenza   28:41
We should put the passwords and all this **** to access that in there too.
We we sorted through that I think, OK.

Greg Saunders   28:47
Yeah.
Separately, though, we're gonna have like a like a a shared password service.
Like we won't put passwords in the vault.

Shawn Lewenza   28:54
OK.

Greg Saunders   28:55
We'll actually have it.
Have a secure password service.
Um, like what?

Shawn Lewenza   29:00
Which one do you use?

Greg Saunders   29:01
We we use a for our team.
We use a service called 1 password and it allows us to like create like organized like organizations and then.

Shawn Lewenza   29:07
Yeah.

Greg Saunders   29:14
And Project associated with particular projects and we can.
It's probably better to do that right from the beginning versus like we waited too long to do it.
And then we're still kind of cleaning up our mess because we all have our own password managers and now we're trying to get everything into this shared vault.
This shared password vault.
To start, do it right from the beginning.
It's much better.
Yeah.

Jeff Violo   29:43
I think I broke my index.

Greg Saunders   29:44
Or eating.

Jeff Violo   29:46
Hey, Greg, if I move an index like I just moved a bunch of stuff up to business development.
Wonder if the like is it broken?

Greg Saunders   29:53
Yeah.

Jeff Violo   29:54
Does it break the index or does the index follow everything?

Shawn Lewenza   29:55
Right.

Jeff Violo   29:57
Jesus, the index still works.

Greg Saunders   30:01
But it'll it'll follow the links, the links will get updated but like.
You could break some stuff like.
Yeah.
We did the call it a date.

Shawn Lewenza   30:20
Yeah.

Greg Saunders   30:21
All right, we'll, we'll, we'll will.
All Star.
I'll create some discussion threads in there too.
You guys go and do the same and then let's just see if that works over the next couple of days.

Jeff Violo   30:34
Yeah, I like it.

Greg Saunders   30:37
Yeah, maybe what I'll do is like maybe maybe just until we get used to it.

Shawn Lewenza   30:37
Alright.

Greg Saunders   30:41
Like if I I might just send you like a like a text or an email or like well Jeff and I will be doing well.
What we're more, more, more and more frequent contacts, so we can just follow it, make sure it's actually gonna work if you want.

Jeff Violo   30:53
The only the only thing that I'm trying to determine is the difference between the docket clearing and the discussions cause I could see myself using the docket.

Shawn Lewenza   30:55
OK.

Greg Saunders   31:00
So.

Jeff Violo   31:01
If there's anything that I want, Shawn or Greg to do, or even myself put sort of timelines and then we have projects.
So the only thing that I'm gonna get confused about is why don't we using a project when are we using Doc and clearing and when we using discussions they're they're all good but.

Greg Saunders   31:18
Yeah, I I it it it can get out of hand if we're not careful.
So like I would think about docket clearing as like I need to like I need a mechanism to draw your attention to something.
Maybe it's not a conversation.
Maybe I just like for example I created this file called domains or I've got a list of all the five domains we registered.

Shawn Lewenza   31:35
Yeah.

Greg Saunders   31:38
Maybe I just wanna put on a note on the docket clearing that.
Hey, I just want to let you guys know that's what I did right.
So it's not really a discussion that's more like an FYI.
That's what I would think could clearing As for as more of like an FYI, just to keep each, just keep each other in the loop.
Um project, the project's part would be more like I have a I have like.

Shawn Lewenza   31:55
Are you going out? Yes.

Greg Saunders   32:00
It's not just a simple like task as in the like A to do list.

Shawn Lewenza   32:00
I'm what is the music?

Greg Saunders   32:04
It's more of like a work package.

Shawn Lewenza   32:06
What was the on Thursday like?

Greg Saunders   32:08
Yeah.
And then yeah, I discussion where like.

Shawn Lewenza   32:12

Greg Saunders   32:16

Shawn Lewenza   32:19

Jeff Violo   32:19
Yeah, we'll figure it out.

Greg Saunders   32:22
