# Oil Sands Biosensor Technology Discussion Summary

The discussion focused on a biosensor technology for detecting naphthenic acids (NAs) in oil sands tailings ponds and water systems. The key participants were:

* Ty Van Ness: Director of Monitoring with Canada's Oil Sands Innovation Alliance (COSIA) under Pathways Alliance
* Sean: Academic researcher who developed the biosensor technology over 10 years
* Greg and Jeff: Business partners working on commercializing the technology through Luminous Bio Solutions

## Key points discussed:

### The Technology:
* Biosensors using engineered microbes that luminesce when detecting NAs
* Provides quantitative measurements of different NA compounds
* Enables high-throughput, cost-effective testing compared to current analytical methods
* Could be adapted for field testing and community-based monitoring

### Industry Context:
* NAs are an emerging concern, especially regarding tailings pond water release
* Indigenous communities are particularly concerned about NA impacts
* Current monitoring includes hundreds of water testing sites across the oil sands regions
* Industry needs better understanding and monitoring of NAs before water release

### Regulatory Framework:
* Federal government sets standards that provinces and industry follow
* New regulations expected around mine water release
* Industry can influence regulations by demonstrating better monitoring approaches

### Next Steps:
* Team to provide 2-page summary for Ty to share with technical teams
* Potential presentations to COSIA/Pathways Alliance member companies
* Need to coordinate with CNRL given existing relationship
* Focus on both technical viability and business case

The discussion highlighted strong potential interest from industry in this technology given increasing focus on NA monitoring and regulation.

I'll provide a comprehensive summary of this conversation about naphthenic acids (NA) monitoring and testing technology in the oil sands industry.

Key Points:

1. Technology Overview
- Sean and team have developed biosensor technology for detecting naphthenic acids
- The biosensors use engineered microbes that luminesce when detecting NAs
- The technology offers high-throughput, cost-effective testing compared to current methods
- Three different biosensors detect different NA structures (acyclic, typical, complex)

1. Current Industry Context
- Naphthenic acids are becoming an emerging area of focus and concern
- Indigenous communities are particularly concerned about NA impacts
- Recent incidents (e.g., Imperial breach in 2023) have heightened attention
- Industry needs better understanding before mine water release
- Current monitoring includes 500+ discrete sites in Athabasca region alone

1. Regulatory & Monitoring Framework
- Federal government expected to refine NA regulatory framework
- Oil Sands Monitoring Program (OSMP) involves multiple stakeholders:
  - Industry caucus
  - Indigenous caucus (First Nations and MÃ©tis)
  - Government caucus (federal and provincial)
- Monitoring occurs both on-site (company-specific) and regionally

1. Business Opportunity
- Timing is good for new NA monitoring technology
- Industry needs better understanding of NAs before water release
- Technology could provide more comprehensive testing at lower cost
- Potential for both laboratory and field-based applications
- CNRL already showing interest through funding

Next Steps:

1. Team to prepare and send Ty a two-page summary including:
- Technology overview
- Results from pilot project with CNRL
- Technical capabilities and benefits
- Keep initial focus technical rather than business-oriented

1. Ty will:
- Share information with technical teams (tailings, water environmental priority area)
- Coordinate potential meetings with relevant groups
- Check with CNRL contacts to ensure proper coordination
- Keep team updated on developments

1. Team should:
- Coordinate through Sean (technical lead) and Greg (coordination)
- Consider both lab-based and field testing applications
- Think about potential community-based monitoring applications
- Prepare for technical discussions with industry experts

1. Future Opportunities:
- Potential integration with community-based monitoring
- Possible expansion to field testing capabilities
- Data management and analytics opportunities
- Integration with existing monitoring programs

The key takeaway is that this technology appears to be well-timed with industry needs and regulatory developments, with strong potential for adoption if properly presented to the right stakeholders.
