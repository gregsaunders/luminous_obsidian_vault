  English, rock was like mainstream. So I definitely missed that. I do have to run really quick. Do you mind if I do a quick update? Yeah. Go on, Link. OK, I actually met with the MyCDL professors this weekend. We did a quick update. I got some feedback with regards to how I'm going to start with this OpEx. But most importantly, I think they're going to try to get me in touch with a few people who do validation in this kind of environmental space for them to kind of double check if my methodology or process is somewhat correct.

I did comb over only two companies so far. The annual statements and MDMAs concerning what I was thinking before on OpEx. I think two things I want to note. Unfortunately, there isn't that smoking gun line item. They're not saying this is how much we do for remediation or whatever. But I should be able to piece together a per unit operating expense. So I guess that's the bad news first. And then perhaps at the foundational level, try to build it with other parts of the statement, with excerpts on like what they're saying.

So, for example, they could say like energy has been down or we paid this much. So hopefully I can give a pretty reasoned margin there. But I think slightly positive news because I was thinking about a lot of what you guys said about effectively treating these tailings. And I was really thinking hard on how these corporations will, they have to announce it. So I think it's quite clear that for sorry, I just need to get the correct terminology here. I think these costs that could be associated with remediating water tailings should be included in the asset retirement obligations.

So these closure obligations related to these oil and gas companies that they anticipate to have. So I think another thing that I'm actually looking out for now is the evolution of AROs in the last couple of years. So I'm trying to compare 2023 to 2024 to see if they've taken on any more ARO retirement obligations. So like essentially whether or not they're forecasting potential ones in the future and perhaps tie that to operations that they have at a project level. But that's kind of like early thought so far.

But I think this will give you a more comprehensive understanding of like what companies are paying for this kind of stuff. So the closest one you should look at is going to be Suncor. Oh, sorry. Suncor, okay. Suncor base plant. Suncor base plant is going to be the first retirement of all the oil sands operations. Suncor base plant. Like so unfortunately they don't really break it down by project level. And then they include a lot of this with like their mining as well as their injecting as well as their drilling operations.

So like retirement of wells and stuff like that. But I think we can find like fair or comparable procedures that they would do that is equated to like mass testing within a certain process. And then kind of back calculate that. That's just my thoughts so far. So, so far I've looked at Synovus in specific detail because they seem like the one that has, that does have a lot of breakdown analysis of per unit costs. And then I also looked at CNRL. Is it per unit per barrel? Is that what that means? Yeah. Yeah.

Sometimes they use per BOE, barrel oil equivalent. But it's just, we can just call it per barrel. And then I also looked at CNRL because they have the most comprehensive discussion about their AROs, the asset retirement obligations. So I was thinking of using these two to kind of get a baseline. But again, like none of these financial statements, like I can't, I can't throw them into chat because they're all images. So I've been just like printing them out and like good old highlighter. So it's going to take a while.

I think, I think my plan is to have that because the phase one, I was planning to wrap up this week. So I actually should have something probably by next Tuesday, like a little excerpt or even just like Excel table concerning like what I think OPEX is, are from these company statements. What will be a reasonable expectation, what we can deduct from these OPEXs. And then I guess whatever's remaining, we can assume is, sorry, Greg, I wasn't looking yet. I'm not sure if I heard you correctly, just around interpreting images.

The, the new, the most recent family of models are like, are extraordinary at interpreting image data. Especially if you were to take like screenshots of these annual reports, is that what you have access to? And you fed them into a nano, banana, nano, banana. You're going to get nearly a hundred percent accuracy in the text recognition. Just to save you some time. I can, just to save you some time. I can definitely try that. Yeah. I think like, so my, my issue is. What's that? It's the new imaging from. Yeah.

You have to have a paid version of Gemini to get the nano banana access to, right? Yeah. I just fed a lot of these statements in, in the chat. And then I always ask for excerpts so I can double check. And it, it's just too much hallucination. And so I confronted chat about it. And it's, I think, I think for this specific purposes, I only need to deep dive like various sections. So I'll scan it. I'll read it. I don't want to, like, I think that's an area. I'm not comfortable leaving to AI. Even as somebody who works for an AI startup.

Yeah. But, yeah. Hopefully. I'm not trying to, I should probably have a table for you guys. But like at least Tuesday with a list of assumptions that I use to generate this OPEX. And then we can kind of see where we go from there. But I was thinking with this OPEX table, I was going to look at some service providers to see if there are comparable service providers that do provide like mass testing for these firms. They'll likely be private. But the business library should have some analytical reports about the segment.

So then we can then generalize, like, these are comparables for Luminous. This is what they do. This is how much they do it. And this is kind of how their pay structures are. I think that might help Luminous, at least within the CDL framework, better demonstrate value. And then perhaps in the future. Yeah. And so there's other operations like Tech Resources is a big mining firm that has, manages all kinds of tailings, right? Yep. So there's other industries that do actually have testing and water release.

Are you considering that as well? Or are you trying to keep it specifically to oil and gas? No, no. So that was something I was thinking about too. Like even frackers and like drillers, they do do a lot of tailing or water treatment. So, I mean, I think I want to see what the current, because like ideally your pilots will be with either a large mining company or a large oil and gas company. And it seems like you guys already have that large oil and gas connection. So I'm just trying to find out like materials that would put your pilot with like a bow on top.

Something. Yeah. Our primary focus with Luminous is oil sands tailings, right? Yeah. So even talking to like a Cenobus, they have to test water, but it's in a very different way. Right? So, you know, the way I see it is they've never had to do this. Do they have anxieties starting to build? There's a lot of regulatory stuff coming from the government that's kind of stimulating them to have to start to move in this direction. And they're going to have to figure out how they're going to pull it off. So, yeah.

So like if we look at the trajectory, like, so I totally understand that there is that water steering committee. But if you look at the trajectory and the processes of developing like industry rules and guidelines, and we can benchmark that with like comparable measures. So in BC, there was one a few years ago about releasing some like mine water. That took about two years from the initial initial notice and comment period. So usually within Canada, comparable regulatory proceedings, even if they do have a lot of like industry and political buy-in takes about one and a half to two years.

So I would imagine that I want to see what the annual statements are looking like. What are the annual statements looking like for 2025 before I can make a definitive, be like, yeah, it looks like they're worried about that. Because right now we only have 2024 statements and by the time the steering committee issues came in, it was too late to incorporate that into their MD&A and releases. But that could be something we look into in March to get more clarity about the ARO modeling aspect of this. So I think right now there's like operation modeling and ARO.

I'm trying to see like which one benefits Luminous better or would apply to Luminous better. That's right, I see. Yeah. For comparables, I posted just a company called Bureau Veritas. They used to be called them Maxam. They might provide a comparable kind of environmental monitoring services. Yeah. I was just looking at their website and they talk about how they support, you know, OPEX for the industry. But there's companies like that that might be, I could provide more targeted, named third party environmental monitoring services that might, for the comparables thing.

Yeah, that might be really helpful. Let me get back to you next Tuesday with an ask. I think, because a lot of these companies are private, I want to see what the, what the, because the university pays for a lot of these like private business reports. So I want to see what kind of they have. Yeah. Cool. Cool. Do you guys have any comments for me? Or, so see you guys Friday then? Oh, sorry. Go for it. I just was, so it looks like you presented to the CDL folks and they liked what you were doing and they provided some possible, um, just professors.

Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. So we, we have, um, uh, like a changing of the guard. One of the professors has gone on sabbaticals. So the new guy is coming in. We would give them, um, periodic updates about the development of our scope. And then we would be like, this is what we're doing. And then if, if anything doesn't jive really well, they're, they're going to be like, oh, you need to redo this. And I think one of the recommendations I had was to look into the AROs, um, the asset retirement obligations. And then maybe a little later down the line, when I have more final numbers, um, I was introduced to a, um, I think an environment consultancy people.

So I was thinking of once I have things done, I want to get that validated by them. And then. Okay. And you have short term timelines, right? So probably by the next session, which is early in January, you'll have some numbers of some kind. That'll be my requirement. So, uh, I have to, I essentially have to write this like report slash white paper by the January 18th, 19th would be the latest. So I was thinking of just doing it over Christmas break. Um, but I, I, I'll keep you guys updated. I should have the OPEX analysis by next Tuesday.

So just for clarification, you're looking at the asset retirement obligations of other, like Synovus or whoever else that, and how that accounts into their financial statements. And then we can start to forward. Look at what asset retirement of tailings is going to start to look like because they haven't had to do that at this point in time. And I, that's, am I clear on that kind of idea? Ideally. Yes. But I think realistically, we can only use the asset retirement obligations to figure out kind of the ratio that they're putting onto these projects.

So for example, if they have like $1 billion project. So that's why I want to explore two, um, uh, two years. So let's say in 2023, they have a, uh, a billion, a new billion dollar project that turned on by 2024. And let's say that their, uh, ARO, uh, asset retirement obligations increased by like a hundred million. So it looks like their ratio that they're using in terms of asset retirement obligation is about 10%. So then that could be a factor that we kind of keep in play when we look at like, oh, um, well, that place is going to go, is going to retire soon.

So like the life of that project value is blah. And then we'll do the apply that ratio. It's not very accurate, but like, I think at this point, we're just anything that's defensible. Yeah. A hundred percent. Yeah. I think, and then what we're trying to do is stimulate thought with them from a sales perspective and a positioning, right? Okay. This is coming down. These are all the things and we, we can actually tie it to their ARO going to impact the, um, DOE, right? That kind of stuff. Yeah. That'd be great.

I love it. Yeah. My own, my own parting thought was we're putting a, or you're putting this effort in to get these numbers, which is good, but they're, they're going to know these numbers. Like they, if they're not public, like you'd say, they are going to know them. Right. Yeah. Yeah. They're going to create some thought. I know. We tell them what areas are going to impact their numbers. They're going to know them right away. So we're trying to find out stuff that they already know. Yeah. Yeah. So I think like, I, I don't think they would know it at a per unit level as it would apply to, to, to like testing or compliance, but they will, I agree.

They will know their own numbers about like operating expenses. I think the idea is like, it seems like kind of like a unnecessary can go. So, so as to speak, but like, you, you can't, we kind of need to demonstrate that, like, where Luminous knows the operations to a certain extent that like, you, they wouldn't need to bring you up to speed. And having that analysis at that level will kind of speak to your industry credibility. At least, I know it sucks, but like, they're not going to tell you. Yeah.

And actually, Sean, if we even give Theo this, right? Like if Theo is going to take this forward to get budget for it. Yeah. We're enabling Theo with numbers and talk that talks to the people that are going to actually, if we're going to allocate the budget, sign the checks is kind of what I'm thinking. That's what you're thinking, Max. Yeah. I think we need to, you know, stroke the egos of the executives. Yeah. I mean, I get it. So it's like, it helps with evaluating the company. It helps with the sales and on multiple levels, like educating them or just letting them know where we fit in.

So, I mean, it's valuable. It's definitely much easier if they just tell us, but they're not going to. I don't know. I'm sorry. I don't have enough industry contacts at high enough level to be like, Hey, what's your compliance budget looking like next year? That's cool, Max. Yeah. Awesome. Thanks. You're showing up Friday? Yeah. I'll see you Friday. Have a good one guys. Thanks, man. See ya. You freaked me out with that email. I was like, Oh my God, are we having a session meeting at nine o'clock? Do we need a fucking song?

What? What the hell? So it's a virtual online thing. And I think they want to be playing music in the background to keep the vibe up is kind of what they're saying in January, the January meeting, right? Yeah. There's a song on my mind that's really corny. And it's something like, it's a three syllable word, like scandalous or something like that. And I was like, Oh, if I could remember what the song was, and if it wasn't too cheesy, you could do an AI version and turn it into luminous. You know, you could really, so it would be recognizable song wise.

Yeah. It would be cheesy, lyrified. I kind of like, I kind of like Rage Against the Machine. It just kind of like sort of fits in and you know. That's actually a good one. Yeah. It's definitely got the energy. Was that your pick, Greg? Yeah. I don't know. I was just, I was making coffee and I was just thinking, huh, I wonder, I had a few others. I was thinking of like, you know, there's some good, there's some good Metallica songs. That'd be a good fit too. But anyway, yeah. Settle on that one. Why do you know, no jazzy standards, I think are going to fit the bill here.

I think it's good. It might be a little too, like, you know, yeah. Oh yeah. Too little, too elevator-ish. Yeah. Anyway. Well, you know, right now the, the only options Rage Against the Machine and I gotta, I gotta submit. So you guys gotta go in and say that you're gonna show up for the second session, right? So you got the emails, did you? Yeah. So, sorry, we, between the three of us, we just have to have one, one song submission, not one, one, one submission for the three, each of us? I don't know. I was applying and it asked for a song.

I didn't know if that's for Luminous or if that's my song. So when you guys go through and apply, they might be asking for another song, but. What did you, what did you put in? Well, I didn't put anything in because I'm the old metal head, right? So I thought that it would offend Sean. So that's the one. And that's the one. So that's the one. So that's one. So that's one. I thought that it would offend Sean, right? So maybe I didn't know if Sean wanted some jazzy something, but, and then I saw Saunders recommendation.

I'm like, Oh, there we go. Yeah. I was thinking about you, Jeff, but yeah. Yeah. I mean, I, I will think about it, but I don't, I'm a, I like the rage against the machine is a great one. For a lot of the level. Do what you tell me. Fuck you. Yeah. Like that. Directly to the mentors, but also like the song to the, uh, industry, like, like raging against the industry. Oh my God. Did anybody notice my new ski boots? No, we didn't because they were under your God damn desk, but thank you for putting them up. Stretching them out.

Hey, just bought them. Nice. What'd you end up getting? Well, you know, it was interesting. Cause I, I, I've given myself permission. Cause I buy ski boots every 15 years to get whatever I needed. And, uh, so typical top of the line ski boots are like 900 to a thousand bucks. Yeah. Right. Just for the boots. And I was looking at these new boa technologies and all this kind of stuff, but I never have foot grief in my boots. I just wanted more comfortable boot that fit. And it's warm. Those are the two things, more comfort and warm.

Cause I got old race boots. So these are actually a top of the line Nordica, but they're like last year's model, but all the ones are going to these new boa systems. And I thought it was pretty cool, but I don't really fucking need it. So these were on sale black Friday special. I got them for 503 bucks. Oh, that's a good deal. So top of the line boot. It's going to meet all my objectives. And I probably say 400 bucks, which I'm pretty darn happy about. So nice. I kind of freaked out this morning. I was, I was like, fuck the session two is a month away and there's a Christmas break over it.

It's like, it's fucking short. Yeah, but we're pretty much done. I've got pretty much everything stuffed. They wanted us to do. I do like, I've got the email stuff down, ready to send to them. I've got the one pager and I've got the blurbs that they were asking for. So that was one of the things that they were asking for. Wait, you got what stubbed out? All the session two requirements? Oh, no, no, no. Sorry. Just the objectives that we were talking about. So from our meeting on Friday, we wanted to change the objectives, right?

And then it's going to be accelerate getting the patent moved over. So I'm already, I've already got it in my list of things to do to basically send an email to the AU to kind of like say, Hey, listen, we want to start to stimulate this. What can we do to accelerate? I do it in a very kind way, but just say, yeah, we're really excited. I also want to start to talk about, you know, getting marketing involved, top telling a great story, leveraging this for both parties, maybe get enjoy Romero involved.

Like, I, I don't know if I'm going to say that right away, but these are the things I want to do. So do you want me to stop talking right now and ask you what you want to know, Greg, or do you want me to complete what I'm saying and then go to you? I never know when you put your hand up what I'm supposed to do. I guess if I was just going to interrupt you, I'd just interrupt you. I was, I'm happy to wait till you're the end until you're done talking. But now that you're done talking, no, the only thing I was thinking on the, like with respect to the patent, you're going to send an email to the, I was thinking about this this morning too, that that's starting to kind of like bug me, just not bug me, but I just know how slow these fucking lawyers work.

Right. Yep. And it would be nice to maybe let the AU people know that, that we have a CDL session early in January. And while we know that it's not possible to have this like squared away by that session, we want to be able to demonstrate significant progress towards achieving that, that agreement. Right. You know what's interesting? It's January 27th. Oh, okay. Which is late January, which is good. That's actually a great point. We want to actually have some form of momentum or some kind of agreement and principle on January 27th.

I think we want AU to have a similar sense of urgency that we have. And if we kind of like, not fabricate, but if we kind of indicate that this is really important in the context of maintaining our CDL sort of like, you know. Yeah. Yeah. Like, we don't want that somehow, like we just want them to, we want to communicate that we don't want that to be a reason why we get kicked out of the program, that we're not able to get that done. No, no, no. That's fucking brilliant. Like we, now we have to say that we, we, you know, probably it might be a little bit rich to say that we'll have it done by the 27th, but maybe almost an agreement and principle.

Right. Significant progress. I think like, you know, like near, near the, near the finish line. Yeah. Yeah. I need a, I need a buyer. Yeah. Yeah. Take your time. Yeah. So I'm going to send out the meeting for tomorrow at 10. My time, nine year time for Steven. Abrams. Talk to my brother. Sorry. What for, for tomorrow? Yeah. What time is nine o'clock tomorrow? Your time. Good. Nine o'clock tomorrow. My time. Nine o'clock tomorrow. My time is fine. Yeah. Um, I, um, um, Max kind of threw me, he didn't throw me off, but I, I think, um, I think there's a very narrow, narrow list of things that we can, we can ask, we can ask Max to do.

Um, I, I don't think that he's, uh, I think he's a very, very much within the confines of my box thinker. Right. Yeah. Well, he's got his idea of what he wants to do and he's going to do it and hopefully it's valuable for us. Yeah. Like, cause I keep going back and go, well, what do you know? Like, no, you're, we're, we're, we're, we're not going to, we're not going to, we're not going to steer this guy too much. Um, he, he's, he's got a pretty much, uh, like I was just saying to Jeff, like my, my take on Max is he's very much an inside my box kind of thinking like, and you know, a little bit tunnel vision, tunnel visiony, which is fine.

Like we're not programming. He has constraints and stuff. So yeah. Yeah. Well, I think, you know, you probably know that better than anything, Sean, right? Like he's like, it's, it's not altruistic that he's doing this either. He's got a delivery and he wants to get a mark. Right. So he's trying to figure out what he's going to give us. It's going to get him the mark that he wants. And he kind of moves on and goes away. Right. So. Or not. I mean, he maybe, yeah, he probably would be thinking differently if he was getting paid to do this and we were telling him exactly what we want, you know.

So the other, so remind me then, um, the objectives, which one was, uh, dropped out in place of figure of the IP strategy. Operational thing. So it's IP strategy. Get a pilot. Make progress in getting funding. Right. So. Hold on a second. Hold on. When is that CDL session? Is the end of January? 27th of January. Wow. Okay. I thought, well, I don't know why I had January 8th in my head. I had January 6th in my head. Let me double check here. Cause I had here. Cause I have my, I have my surgery at the end of January.

I, I, I might still be in the fucking hospital. Well, it's okay. I don't think everyone needs to be there. Yeah. And it's an online thing too. Right. So yeah, I'm not that worried about it. Fuck do I put it? Yeah. I think. I hope it's the end of January. It is. Oh, it's the 28th of January. Okay. That. Yeah. I'll be. There's, there's a social session. If we're in Calgary on the 27th. Right. So they're, they're having a party. So if you're in Calgary, you can go to the party. I won't be. If not, it's just the 28th from eight and it's from eight till four 30.

Okay. And it says, submit your walk up song. We want to bring a lot of energy to this session and you can help. Please share a song that gets you fired up, focused and ready to take on session day. We'll feature a selection of these songs throughout the virtual day. That week. That week they had was the first time they've ever had that. Yep. The full week kind of idea. Yeah. All right. That's okay. I'll, yeah, I'll be, I'll be, I'll be there. What the hell else are we here? I don't know. Well, so dropping the, we're not really dropping it.

Like it's still an important thing around finding out about operations and other possible. So is there something we can do? Is there something we can do on that front? So, I kind of tie that into the pilot piece, Sean. So, one thing I want us to talk about is what would, like we're just going to do the pilot purely as a cost recovery. Oh, I had a conversation with Mark Donner from Alberta Innovates yesterday, telling him, because he's the water guy and he, his part of Alberta Innovates is project based.

So if we have a major project we want to do, it's under his wheelhouse. So I said, we're approaching oil sands operators to get a pilot. So I told him all about the good stuff that we got from CDL. I told him about the objectives and how well it was received, validation. And then I said, because I've had multiple conversations with Mark as well. And I said, we are going to approach the oil sands operators for a pilot that starts in May-ish. So I wanted to know what I'm allowed to tell them. But I said, ultimately I'd like to have a one-to-one matching.

So if I get them with secured money, that they'll frickin' bolt on. A couple of things that he said that was really good for me to know was the ERA is a competition. And when you have a competition, there's very strict guidelines. And one of those guidelines is typically you have to have an industry partner with a secured budget, line item budget for the project. Because it's very formal and because it's a competition, some people lose, some people win, they get selected. With Alberta Innovates, they have a continuous intake where you approach them and they've got an application process.

So I'm going to start the application process fairly soon. And I said, you know, this is kind of what we want to do. We want to do at least one season pilot, maybe a multi-season, haven't figured all that kind of stuff out. And we want to prove out certain things. And we're, you know, if I can approach the oil sands operator saying, I'm going to drag you along, you know, that really helps to grease the skids. So he's a great guy. I really like him. He's got to, you know, he's got to hold his reservations and stuff like that.

But, you know, the one thing I want to do is I want to actually come up with a budget. And really what the budget's going to be is how much is it going to cost, Greg, for you to actually host this application, you know, just from a cost perspective, what you need from a team to set up like the data model, right? So like maybe a Martin and a Justin and you 50% of the time or something like that. Sean, I need to know from you, do we just need Tyson or would Tyson need another assistant, right? You know, are we doing weekly tests?

Are we doing daily tests? We have to set it up so they ship it to us. So we want to have everything off site. We don't want to actually tie it to their IT. So we get the results. We get whatever data that we want to correlate with those results. And we just basically give them a window and we give them the insight. So it's not going inside their firewall. So it's kind of frictionless from that perspective. So if we're putting a budget together, you know, cost recovery, like how many tests do we need at, um, at, um, what's the name of our place that we rent desks at, Greg?

Assembly. Assembly, for fuck's sakes. Will the University of Calgary need something if we're doing kind of like a commercial cost pilot? What material cost do we need? Like, Sean, from your side, like what's the cost of the Petri dishes? Maybe we want to buy a high-resolution camera specific for this. And we could probably slide that in, right? What equipment that you, do you need that's going to make this the most kick-ass, reliable, dependable fucking solution? Like, I want you to think about that and give me like a high-level budget.

Because this is just cost recovery. But we want to give them an estimate as to how much this is going to cost. So, I think it's going to be like around $750,000 to go from May to the end of December. Because we'll have a period where we're going to be compiling stuff. And these are the deliverables. So, we have to have some time to put some deliverables. And that aligned with Mark, what Mark said with many of these projects. You got like the season to test and do all the stuff. And then you kind of have the winter to compile the data and report, right?

Maybe we roll into a second season. Is that valuable for us to have multi-season, kind of like with Curl Wetland? But I need that kind of soon. So, how many people, how much per month do we want to pay them to do this? What equipment do we need? What would the rent be with University of Calgary? And the third thing is, how many desks would we want to have at Assembly Card? So, pure cost recovery. And Greg, all of your other costs, right? Licensing, posting, blah, blah, blah. Okay. First thoughts. This is really good that you're spending all this time with Alberta Innovates and getting in the door there.

Because not only is it important to bring in funding, but it's kind of like one of those recognition pieces that the government pays attention to. And everyone pays attention to. So, if you've made inroads there and you've got a project going, it's big. So, just like CDL was big. And sometimes it's bigger than you imagined. Well, you know what's also nice is he said he'll come in on some meetings with us, too. Well, that would be. We'll join you in meetings with CNRL or Suncor. He's like, yeah, we'll come to meetings if you want.

And I'm like, okay. That's cool. Yeah. Yeah. So, you got that sort of angle of the leveraged funding where some of it comes from Alberta Innovate. So, it reduces the cost of CNRL. They obviously love that. So, say the pilot is $750,000. We get one operator that's $375,000. If we get two operators sharing the cost, that's $187,500. But we get exposure into two accounts, two critical accounts, Suncor and CNRL. Can you say that again? I didn't follow up. Okay, so, say, for example, the budget cost is $750,000. I just use that as a fucking number that I pull out of my ass.

Because Brian Anderson says figure out your costs and then add a bunch. Right? Add 50%, he usually says. Because you're going to run into over that. But because it's a cost recovery, we're just covering our costs. Right? So, here's the budgeted item. We might be able to come in a little bit lower. Now, if it's through Alberta Innovate, we probably have to stay within that. So, we do need to have a bit of a buffer. But if we get one operator, if it's just CNRL doing the test, it's $375,000 for the season. Right?

So, I'm going sort of May to end in December kind of time frame. Why is it? Because it's a two-season pilot? No. No. We do the pilot. But then we start to compile data and have some time to give some deliverables. Kind of like ideally. Because what I really want to do with the pilot is this is what we're trying to prove out. This is how we want to conduct it. And then we want to compile data and actually give them back some deliverables of these are the insights that we got. These are the operational savings we can do.

This is interesting as to how things are working. I'm just wondering how you, so half the budget is for the pilot, the first half of the sampling, and the other half is for the analysis. And how did you? I came up with a number where I went $10,000 a month per person. Some people are going 50%, blah, blah, blah. And then I kind of made up a number. Like, really, I pulled a number out of my list. No, no, no. Not how did you get to $750,000. How did you get to $375,000 for one company? Oh, Alberta Innovates gives half of the total project.

Sorry, yeah, the Alberta Innovates. So it's $375,000. But if we got two, it's $187,500 for each. So it's kind of a real, it's almost like a, it's really simple. What you're suggesting is that two operators partner on a pilot? Yeah. That'd be interesting if you pull that off. I mean, I think the problem there is you're going to be dealing with one operator's waste and asking another operator to kind of partner on Effluent that they're not, that's not part of their facility. But no, no, no, no, no, no. So we'll get samples from Suncor.

Oh, okay. Okay. Okay. And then we'll get samples from CNRL. Sorry, sorry. I want to be in both operations so they actually have visibility to us, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. More importantly, we got really tight relationships and we build and we give them both insights to theirs. Yeah, yeah. And we can maybe cross-pollinate if it makes sense, but yeah. Yeah, that's good. Focus on Suncor and CNRL because we already did this with Imperial and... Well, Imperial's fucked right now because they just whacked their whole Calgary office.

They're moving everything to Houston. That's what my buddy James Guthrie said. He's like, fucking, he doesn't know what they're going to do, right? So we'll get back in the form. I had this guy at my house, Catherine's girlfriend's husband, an interesting guy, but he just reminded me... Well, he had all kinds of connections with oil and gas developers. And he was... I talked a little bit about the company and he said, I can introduce you to people that have some money if you're looking for investors, like serious money that he goes hella skiing with, kind of thing.

And he's a big-time developer. So he's hobnobbing around with, you know, guys with money in the sector. But then he just, you know, he's... He's climate change denialist, which is a little bit of a problem, but also like... We're in the입s to the trusted companies. How'd you go to the house? What do you want to do with me? I'm excited. I'm excited. I'm excited. How'd you do this? How'd you go? I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you. You love you. I love you. I love you. And so I love you.

Which is a little bit of a problem. But also pro-business, pro-oil and gas. Canada needs to double our... Whatever. The whole energy around producing more gas right now with the Liberal government supporting all these projects. How are we positioning ourselves to possibly be in the stream of that flow of money? Because are there things that are coming that we could tap into? Or is it just... How is that money going to be made available? I would think we can tap into it. If you want to double the production, you've got to manage your tailings better.

So I think this is my perspective of how Luminas should position ourselves politically. We're not denying. We're not agreeing. We're Switzerland. We do know that there's a big fucking environmental problem with the tailings there. And we'd really like to actually be a part of having to solve that problem. We're problem solvers. So we don't hate oil and gas. We're production enhancers too. Like we're... Totally. And oh, by the way, the fucking positive you get out of fucking operational efficiencies is a way to clean the water effectively and provide transparency to the regulator and the local indigenous.

Right? So, do these good things for yourself. Not ultra-realistically like Max says. Because you're getting... It's driving down costs and making you more efficient. But out of that, you got way better insights as to how to clean the water. And when you actually go to release the water, you have a higher confidence level that it's going to be safe for release. Right? So that's kind of how I want us to sort of do that. So I don't want to get into fucking debates or arguments about fucking GHGs or whether oil and gas should be shut down and shit like that for sure.

I get our positioning. I'm just wondering if there's like identifiable sources of money that is being put out there. That's government. No, absolutely. We'd love to chat with them. 100%. We're all over it. Because the best thing we can do is say no. So if they're fuckers, right? And we're going to run into a lot of fuckers. They want to come in and give us money, but they want to own us like we're their little bitches. We need to be very, very aware of how bad that can be. And the one thing that George Damien told me last week or the week before was they want you to have control, but it's their term sheets and their cap tables or like the, or sorry, it's their investment.

Fucking what it says is if things go sideways, they own it and you don't. So we don't want to be in a situation where we accept money. And if our company is unsuccessful, these guys have your IP or Greg's IP. You know what I mean? Like that's what, that's what came up for me after that meeting was that in many successful or in many biotechs, the science founder gets the fucking boot ejection. As soon as other money comes in, they're like, we don't need this fucking guy. And in say my case, the technology is already developed.

So we're not like developing it. So I'm more expendable because it's already, the work's been done, so to speak. So how, and Greg obviously would want to defend his IP. So how do you protect against that? Max did say one thing, have a number in mind as to what you're willing to walk away with it from. Have a number in your head, what you need to walk away from it for. That's because, because, because that's the pattern is they get the science people because they want to run it because they think they know better or what?

Well, I, I part of, so, I mean, these are all agreements, right? And like, you don't have to sign an agreement that, that sets up a condition where you get the boot, like at the earliest opportunities. Don't sign those agreements. Right. You kind of push back on those terms. I think what ends up happening is a lot of people like kind of in our space. Are desperate? Well, there's a, there's an element of desperation and then there's a, there's an element of, of maturity in this kind of investment space. Like we don't have a lot of exposure to, to this kind of investment space and these kinds of people.

Like we are, people are in our network do, but we don't. So it's easy to take advantage of people like us. Right. And yeah, I think that happens a lot to advantage in the sense that like where these agreements create the conditions, right. That favor like the one, one party over the other. And the one party that's kind of in a disadvantaged state just doesn't have the acumen to kind of evaluate the thing that they're signing often. Right. And those, I think, I think desperation drives it too. It's like, Oh, if I don't get this money, this project is just never going to happen.

It's not going to go anywhere. It's like, so then now, now you're like, now you're setting up this, like, like a very narrow either or, like either I take this money and, and, and, and we push this thing forward, or I decide we're just not going to do this and go, go, go get a day job. Those are usually kind of like, and, and usually it's never, it's never that black and white, but I think it's easy to kind of like forward. It brings people into thinking that it's an either, or, right. So, so the best thing that I went through is I had a job for 14 years with a company by the name of Q9 networks.

I used to fucking sell my products at often twice the price of my competitors. And our terms and conditions were always on our side. So I had a fucking CEO that was like, I don't fucking compromise on price. And here's the terms and conditions. And they can go fuck themselves if they don't want it. So I had to learn how to A, position Q9 very, very strongly and the value proposition. And B, I got really good at reading through contracts and going, you know, these are the terms and conditions. Because I was always trying to negotiate between the company and the customer because I wanted a deal.

The CEO was going, go fucking sell the value. And I'm like, just give me a bit of a fucking break, right? That never happened. And then you got a customer who's like one of the biggest oil and gas companies in Canada. And they're going, these are the terms we give to all of our vendors. No. They walk away pissed off. And I think the fucking deal is walking out the door. But if we actually know what our value is, and if we know what we want. Now, like Max said, is that we have to recognize value in money, right?

So somebody's bringing money and is going to give us a hundred grand, a million, two million, whatever the number is. We have to honor that with value because there's risk that they have. We think it's lower risk because we have higher TRL and we're ready to go. We got relationships. But I guarantee you, if we actually raised a little bit of money, just enough to get us through to the end of the fucking pilot and the pilots are successful and we're moving to commercial terms, the valuation of our company is significantly higher.

So there's a value right now where we are. We've got the tech, but we don't have a customer or revenue. Securing a pilot, even in the pilot stages, is good. Maybe bumps up a little bit. Maybe we've finished a successful commercial pilot that's converted into revenue quite a bit more. So we have to also have these conversations to see how do we value this, right? Yeah, and I would like us at one point. Maybe it's too early, but what do we individually think of what that number is? Because it could be an attractive thing where we've built something and then there's an early exit because someone just wants to run it.

And there's a big payday and we're like, that's fine. Or, you know, and someone would be continuing, you know, there could be, I don't know that Greg would see it that way because your thing is so new and has so many other applications. Yeah, but you know what? I have a lifetime left of building new stuff. Like I can just go do something entirely different. Go build something, go make something new. Yeah, yeah. That's exactly the way. Like if he had five or ten million in his bank, it's going to be a lot fucking nicer to do than when you have nothing in your bank, right?

So, yeah. So that'll be a fun conversation when the time comes. The other thing is about this, like I feel, I think I feel that the people that are advisors for CDL who are also investors have an obvious conflict of interest. And I don't understand how they do this fucking show. So how does CD, I felt like writing to our venture leader, I'm like, to me it seems like there's a conflict of interest. Not that I've experienced this, but like if you have people that would benefit from your company being valued lower, if they're going to invest than valued higher.

How do you mitigate this conflict of interest? So the guy who recommended us into this, his name is George Damian, I talked to him last week or the week before. My weeks are blending in together. And he was a little bit jaded about CDL for some reason, but he's like, see it for what it is, right? CDL's built for the mentors, not for the ventures. I know that's in the fucking bullshit context. No, it's great. But we know the game that we're playing, right? So these guys, and that also made it very aware why they were anchoring on, you guys don't have the IP?

And what was the second one? You go to get a pilot or like, they're like, you could see them like verbally, like intensely. They fucking anchored on it to the point where I was like, fuck off, right? Like, but then I realized we are not the valuable company we are unless we have the IP, because if the fucking things go tits up, they won't actually have an asset. So if they're investing money in their company, they want to know what assets they have. And if the company is unsuccessful, you at least have these pieces, right?

So it'd be, it'd be frickin the foundry and, and, and the biosensor, how it gets disseminated out. Who knows, but that's where their mind is at. So when they realized, wait a minute, these fuckers don't have IP. And, um, they haven't secured the pilot. What was, was that the second thing that they anchored on? I've got it written down, but I don't know. Yeah. It was evident that this is their intention, which is good. So we know that. Yeah. We know that, but I think, this kind of feeds back into the, like the, uh, the, like the, the, the first question or observation, Sean was like, um, um, you know, uh, being taken advantage of, right?

Like 30 years ago, we'd probably, we probably wouldn't see CDL for what it is. And then we would probably just give them whatever they asked for. And then just end up in a situation where they kind of like, we work for them. Right. Like we, we would just be starry eyed if someone wanted to give us like a hundred grand, like 30 years ago. But, and like, no, like a hundred grand does a hundred grand doesn't pay my bills even for five months. And my household, like, like, like, you know, like fuck off with a hundred grand.

He already told us he, I would bet you that Doug already has a hundred thousand dollars in mind. And he told us in that meeting that that's how much, you know, as a hypothetical investment, I'm like, oh, that's, that's what he's thinking of investing a hundred day. Yeah. So anyway, I think, I think CDL is fine for fine for what it is. It's, it's, it's good. It, I, I, to me already, it's funny. Cause I was, I don't know, I probably didn't mention this, but, um, I thought about, um, after the first session in my mind, we've already achieved our objective with CDL in my mind, because we just, because of all the connections that we've made, just being able to sit in the same, like to have Steve, Steve Lout being in the, being in the, having him like in the same room and being able to talk to a person like that, to me, that already, achieve the objective.

Right. Because we've always known that it doesn't matter what we're doing, whether it's this or any kind of technology worked on the past or whatever, you got to be at the table with the, with people that whose titles start with C, right. CEO, CTO, CIO. Like you need to be talking to those people. Cause if you're talking to anyone, anyone else further down the food chain, like you're in a whole other world of pain. Not that you can't make headway there, but it's just like you're, you're, they're thinking differently further down the food chain.

They're thinking about keeping their jobs. Right. And not creating, not creating risk. So you need to be talking to that, to that C level people, that C level kind of person. And as far as I'm concerned, we like, we already got out of CDL what we needed, but like excited to continue, but like it's already been successful as far as I'm concerned. So here's the note that I did from my conversation with, with, with George Damien CDL is there to serve the mentors, not the founders. The deck is stacked against us, you know, and he also said, you might want to look at strategic buyers, like CNRL, like maybe they fricking invest in our company, something like that.

But we're not altruistic in the, in going into CDL either. What was our intention? Access to money, access to customers. So as long as we know that this is a transactional relationship, we worked the shit out of it. It also gave us some really great street cred, like Greg said, it gave us some great validation. So fuck off. We're going to do exactly what you're not our bosses. This is one thing that's clear. They are not our bosses. So I'll play the game because I'd like to be a CDL graduate. But the other thing that George said is out of the entire CDL, um, ecosystem.

So there's all different cities around the world that have CDLs or different universities. They have had very few successful exits and an exit means they put money into a company, company grows big. And there's an exit, right? Where everybody, I can high fives. But they had all those big billions of dollars of numbers flashing on the screen in the slideshow before the evaluations. And I have some of those, uh, screenshots. In fact, I was just looking at them. A revolutionary. Sorry. As, as an investor, I think that with George's perspective was an exit.

Yeah. Yeah. And what an exit is, is I put money in and I took it out and I've fucking 100x my money or 50x, whatever they want. You know, that's what they're looking for. I thought they were advertising all kinds of exits there. That's all. Well, they're also saying, showing that to get all of us who are ventures excited. What was the date? Was that November 3rd? Uh, November 5th. 7th. November 7th. November 7th, yeah. All right. Uh, I have a bunch of screenshots from the six. What are those? Okay, I must have moved them.

Oh, um, shit. Where did I move them all to? Anyways, I wanted to go back and visit those numbers of, like, they were trying to sell. They were trying to sell their, um, their system of being successful. Look how much money we raised, yada, yada, yada, right? Can't find it. Oh, yeah, no, I remember. But so I thought they were saying there's far more things going on than just, uh, very, like, I thought they were saying we had a lot of exits. I mean, you can cook the books and show it all the numbers you wanted.

Like, they were in the billions of dollars. They're some of the numbers. I was like, how the fuck did they raise all this money? What the hell? Greg, when do you leave again to drive back? Uh, so I'm headed back to Calgary on Saturday. I'll be in Calgary for, because our whole team is getting together in Calgary next week for three days. So, uh, flying to Calgary on Saturday, flying back to Victoria on Thursday next week. And then Mel and I are coming back to Christmas and New Year. And then on January the 15th, we start our drive back.

We'll be done here. Okay. And, okay. Now we got to go to Ontario kind of like the following week because my surgery is on the 22nd of January. Are you flying from Victoria to Ontario? No, from Calgary. On the 15th, we're going to leave Victoria, start, start driving back. Oh. To Calgary. Oh, I got it. And then the week, the next week, I go to Ontario for that surgery. How's that new Subaru treating you? Oh my God, it's a great little car. Melissa loves that car. Do you have that in, um... Yeah. Yeah, we don't...

Oh yeah, of course you're, you're, of course you're up on the island, fucking in BC. You gotta have your little frickin', you know, Subaru. Wouldn't want to have the fuckin' taco. It's, uh... Oh, there's lots of tacos here. There's lots of tacos here. Yeah, but you, you, you, you and Mel look more like fuckin' Subaru drivers, right? You know, but the whole talk just never made any sense. Well, Subaru's got this weird sort of lesbian sort of following, right? Like, it's, uh, it's known for... The Lesbaru. The Lesbaru.

The old Subaru, yeah? A Les, what? The Lesbaru. Lesbaru. Funny, like, we actually know a couple of lesbian couples, um, from up north, and they actually own Subarus. Like... Anyway. They were actually, um, in that, I think it was that community that was saying the big failure about the design of the Subarus, like the Crossbacks, is that the compartments that hold coffee mugs do not hold a one liter jug of, uh, Nalgene bottle. They're too skinny. Anyway, yeah. Yeah. Things amazing on gas. That thing can go 800 kilometers on a tank of gas.

Well, going from the Tacoma to anything, just like my Frontier, they're fuckin' brutal in it. Yeah, I hate my truck for gas. Like, for gas. It's just, it's sickening how much gas it uses. Um... Anyway. We got reviews back from a paper that we submitted, which is, from the company's perspective, not the most important paper. Can you see me still? I can see you. Yeah. Okay. I've lost my screen with all the, your faces. Um... And it's one of those things where you, like the paper got rejected, but it was kind of a process.

There was a lot of issues raised. So the editor said, technically, we have to reject it. But if you resubmit it, and you address these things, we encourage you to do that. And so it's, I took 48 hours before I read these things, because it's too much, like it just gets my system all riled up. And I gotta, I take two days, then I read it. I did, I did the chat GPT. And then I did that analysis with Tyson. And we figured out it's reasonable for us. We did something they want us to do, we couldn't get it done.

So we can't, we can't meet that hope, but it's okay. There's basically one experiment we're going to try. And it was an important one. And we'll, it's a lot of changes and edits and corrections. So we'll figure it out. But, um, what was it? What was the paper? Oh, yeah. What was the rejection? What was the paper for? Like, what was the intent of it? The paper was like the followup to the original paper, which describes how the bacteria sense the napthenic acids. And it's how it's about the regulatory systems that bacteria use to sense and then turn on the genes.

So it's more like there's a bio, this is the mechanism of how bacteria do it. And it wasn't like, like earth shatteringly new. It was just, um, there's a system that bacteria use frequently. And now they've, they use it in different contexts. So the burden of proof to show what we were showing wasn't high because we were showing experiments that were done in another context, but this is how they work in this context. So it'll be fine. It was mechanistic. It's not like it's gonna, it's not as important nearly as it's not as even close to the one I'm also writing about the orbit trap versus the biosensor.

And I only have three weeks to get both two papers done. I got a revision and two papers to write and, um, all right. And, um, all right. Fucking you need to engage me or Greg to accelerate this with fucking, um, AI. Okay. Like having your papers in, you know, your, your text format, you know, correlating them together, instructing what you need to do. You would be astonished how much you can cover off effectively. Um, I think I would be selective about what I had to do, but I'm open to it. I, I've had this, I have used it in certain contexts, like, uh, writing introductory sections and laying out, this is what I want you to summarize.

And that works pretty well as a draft. And then you can sort of edit it or repackage what I've written and simplify it. Um, but I'm open to what you might show me, um, for writing a paper. Like, um, I use it for the review process. And like, like you said, Jeff, be brutally honest, summarize the criticisms, tell me how to write the, uh, the response, which would, what's, and they gave me this sort of, this is the brutally honest, maximum optimal response. This is the sort of mediocre response. This is bare minimum.

And then it said, would you like me to write a point by point rebuttal letter, which is what you have to do. And I said, yes. So it does that. Oh, good. So yeah. But I think actually there's, there's something, Sean, the next time we're together, this might even warrant getting together sooner than later, but we, uh, uh, like the way Jeff is using, uh, these tools right now is a lot, a lot, how I, I use them for writing software. Like he, he's treating, uh, and I think this is a really good use cases, all of the information you have available to you as supporting material or whatnot, all research data, anything you treat it as source code kind of in a, in a, in a project repository and kind of sorted and organized in a way that you would maybe sort and organize the kind of source code.

Like structurally. And so that it makes sense to you so that when you're having these interactive sessions, uh, with a, with an agent, you're able to provide like all of the context, like that supports the conversation you want to have. And then you can create kind of like a memory really of that, those interactions by saving, saving those interactions also to, to, to sort of log files that then can support other conversations. So it's almost like you're, it's, it's changing it from like an input output to more of a collaborative kind of, uh, like interaction, like long running collaborations versus like these tactical in and then out again.

Um, so yeah, Jeff's huge. Yeah. Jeff's huge because it supports everything after that. Exactly. Like Jeff's actually using software development, a software development tool to, to actually do this stuff. Like he's using a, like an integrated development environment that we use for writing code, but basically his code is a library of all of this textual material that we've been accumulating over time. Right. And that's his source code for having these inner, these collaborative interactions. It's a really powerful technique.

Um, and there's something I wanted to share with you guys too. I mean, it's, there's, um, I'll, I'll share the links with you, but these, uh, this group of researchers and they published a paper on, uh, one of the problems with LLMs is hallucinations and inaccuracy and stuff. And, and, and, and content and the way that these tools, like, like they deteriorate over time. So you're in, you're in an interactive session and over time, the quality of the interaction deteriorates because you've got a lot of like, a lot of, uh, background noise.

Like in the previous parts of the conversation that are polluting the context. Right. So they found like with these kinds of long running interactions, like as you progress through them, like the quality deteriorates, the accuracy deteriorates, the hallucinations increase. And so this group of, uh, AI researchers, they, um, they're like, we got to solve this problem. So what they, they, what's it called? It's called this maker technique. Um, where the fuck did that paper go? So quick, quick question about that, Greg.

So sometimes I compact my conversation. Does that help? Compacting might help, but, but there's a different technique. Um, and I don't, I, I think you would deploy this tactically. The, um, the paper is on, uh, uh, was it arcs, arcs, arcsive.org? Um, is that like a, is that a pre, uh, a pilot or a, um, uh, here, here's the paper. It's solving a million, a million step LLM task with zero errors. And so they, Archive, this is preprint. So, yeah. So anyway, the, um, what? Just to let you know, this is like not peer reviewed.

This is the way that they're getting over. This is pre, pre, peer review and it's meant to be community reviewed, but this is the way things get out immediately. Right. So it's, it's, it's taking, taking over the, the model where the publishers get all the money and they do fuck all. Yeah. Yeah. So, so anyway, and there's a good hacker news discussion about it. Um, where did that go? This, that, this is important to read because I, I'm not exactly sure how we're going to use it yet, but if we figure out like how to use this, it would certainly give us a, a tactical advantage in how these tools are used.

There's, um, oh yeah. And here's the, this video, this video, watch this video first. So here's video is the last link. So when we get off this call, watch the video, read the hacker news discussion, and then go read the, uh, archive, uh, uh, paper. And, um, I just stumbled across it last night, so I don't know how we're going to use it yet, but I think we need to figure out how to use it. Well, I need to figure out how to use AI in all kinds of problems. And I think this is the path is through this data platform you're building, but it's good.

I can communicate better with you than I can with the computer science nerds and the people that are in the box. Yeah. And even though they're machine learning experts, I just don't find them to be useful. So if you want to get some academic papers, Greg, you know, and fulfill that, um, it scratched that itch and also, you know, develop it for the business. I think we could work together on that. Oh, Sean, I got to tell you what Greg's doing right now is fucking blowing my on UI on, on, on user interface.

You've got to watch it. Oh no, I did. I sent, I sent you the link to it. No, no. The, the, the last one that you did on user interface and the pixel pushing and stuff like that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Did you send that one to me? Um, well, yeah, I did. It was fucking like, it kind of like, Oh my God. What is this? Oh yeah. You got to send that to fucking Justin too. Uh, I, I did actually. It's this idea, Sean, that, that user interfaces are disposable. Uh, yeah. There we go. So. Hello. Yeah. All right. There we go.

Uh, there we go. There's any resources behind if, uh, there's a school. There we go. There's really no humans behind them, so... There's no, there's no way underhumanizing. User interfaces are disposable. Like they're becoming, user interfaces are becoming disposable. What really matters is kind of the back end. And you can generate user interfaces kind of on demand, like that, that, that's, that meet a very specific context. And then you're, you can be done with it. Right. And those user interfaces could be like everything from like, you know, think of actually one of examples was like, you know, business intelligence people, business analysts and stuff that are looking at data and creating graphs and reports and stuff.

Like you can generate all that stuff. Like if you have, if you have the supporting material, you can generate those out, those outputs now. So you don't need to build a dashboard anymore, like a, like in an application, although you, you'd still have use cases for that. But for some, some cases, but like now you can, you can just. And like, this is like, we only just kind of turned that corner, like, like this, like in the last couple of weeks where you actually now have a model that is sufficient for generating like user facing material on demand, like, you know, presentation data, like user interface kind of like material.

Um, yeah. So Sean, just think about it. They're doing a query in the oil sands operations, trying to figure some complex, trying to solve some complex problem. It requires unique data sources. And if they can actually fricking do compile it, it might just give you the, the dashboard specific to that, but it might be a throwaway. Is that how, as I understand it, Greg, like you're interrogating the data in a certain way and show it to me in this way. And it just auto magically fucking presents you a UI. Whereas normal user interfaces are detailed, planned out and fucking locked and loaded.

Right. So, yeah. Like Greg is a huge, Greg's the backend guy. So all his magic happens in the background. User interface is what you and I are using with the fucking web browser. Right. And typically that has to be very strict because it's tied directly to the backend and it's making these queries and it's presenting stuff. So it kind of blew my mind, Greg. I got to admit, I was like, is I think what you're putting together has to have an element of auto magically fucking pixel pushing as opposed to actually having, well, we'll have some structured stuff, but I actually really started to think about even your BPMN tool.

Right. But within, within the mullet, as they were calling it, we can actually start to fucking pixel push whatever. Right. But we've got like clearly defined sort of processes are, that's what I started to think about from a conversation yesterday. Right. I started mullet and Sean is like, what the fuck are you talking about? So in the, so in, in the AI space, a big, a big thing in 2025 was they're calling 2025, the year of the agent, where there's going to be all these AI agents that go out and do stuff for you, act on your behalf, do things, blah, blah, blah.

And so there has been a lot of development in that agentic AI space. And there's whole platforms now to create like, uh, AI, uh, agent workflows. Right. And you can give the, the agents access to tools like email, a web browser. And to implement custom tools and stuff. But there isn't a lot of structure around creating these, these kind of complex, like agentic workflows. And the, what I've seen so far is just like, it's really easy to create an unruly mess that you can't manage anymore. Like you just create this, this, this, this, this, this garbage sort of process.

And it's, it wouldn't be, it become really difficult to maintain. There's been a specification around for a long time called a BPMN. It just stands for business process model and notation. And it is, uh, it's a diagramming, uh, specification for modeling workflows and business processes. It doesn't have to be a business process, any process. It's a well-defined specification. It's been around for 20 years. It's got lots of guard rails, really well-defined. And so I've been thinking for a little while now, like how, how could you combine this idea of an agentic workflow, right?

That doesn't have a lot of structure. And often these agents, like they're not, they're not deterministic, right? Like there's no guarantee that the same inputs are going to give you the same outputs, right? You could end up with the, you could give the same inputs and end up with different outputs, depending on like how the, how the AI feels that day, right? Like, so they're not deterministic. So they come, they do become problematic. Um, and so you're, you, the path through your workflow could, could change just depending on like the conditions of the, of the day, right?

BPMN, like you, you define very structured workflows. Uh, you can have some elements of like, you know, like some like free formidness kind of in a particular part, a particular step, but then like it'll flow through more structured, like flow into the rest of a structure. Anyway, how do you, how do you combine these two things? So I was just like working with like collaborating with, you know, my tools. And I started building out like a little, a model that combines both the structure of BPMN with the, uh, the kind of the, the flexibility and the robustness of, of, of, of an agent kind of in the same thing.

Right. Anyway, I was like, just as I was building this and actually chatting at the same time, um, it came up with a name and it was called, it called this, like it called this thing mullet and it's exactly what you're thinking. Right. That the BPMN part of it, the, the, the structure is, um, you know, business in the front and then the agentic part of it that can just do whatever the fuck it wants is the party in the back. So I was like, Oh, that's a fucking perfect name for the, for this thing. That's, that's what we're calling it now.

Well, that, that, that part of it, we'll refer to it as the mullet, the mullet architecture for process, uh, definitions. I have an immediate, a good question about using AI to solve one of my issues. I have all this data now where I have all the raw data of, of, and I've shared some of the graphs of like orbit trap versus mass spec. And Jeff looks at them and he goes, they're fucking perfect. Right. And I said, I've done some stats analysis and I don't get great correlations, but I think I should have a conversation with doing stats on AI and raw data, giving it raw data.

Yeah. Yeah. Cause that, that should be fun. So here's the thing. Like when you, when, um, when you more move into using tools like cloud code, which is a agentic software development tool and Jeff's using that, but in the, for his stuff, it's a software development tool, but it works well for the work that he's doing. And if you use like at the same time, like Gemini, the Gemini agent or the open AI codex agent, and you use it in the context of like a, an integrated development environment that a software developer would use, you can ask these things to write code.

Like instead of just like asking the LLM to like, look at a block of text or a table of data and try to analyze it textually. You can ask it like, Hey, right, right. A, uh, a Python program that can interpret the data and then give me back the results. Right. So you, you're basically like, because like the best tool to sort of analyze some data, it might not be text. It might be, Oh, I need something that can analyze tabular data. And then in your agent, you can say, Hey, you know, Claude, um, write whatever Python code you need.

I don't even want to see it. Just write the Python code to analyze this data and give me back what I want. And so that, that kind of like, it's giving your interaction with AI access to way different tools than most people have when they're just in a chat bot. Right. And often what's happening, like Jeff, you probably don't even see it or it happens and you don't know what it's, what it's actually doing. It's doing this kind of stuff. Like when you're analyzing that, it's actually writing code to help, to help you analyze.

So it's not, so there you're breaking free from the LLM. The LLM has actually written some code to help the LLM analyze the output. Like it's. Yeah. But if I want to try this today, I can't, I can't do all that. Well, you need one of us to help you, but yes, you could. If we could do it with you. So a couple of things, Sean, the way that I think, and Greg's taught me a lot of this over the years, right? Greg thinks in folder files and folders, right? Folder structures, how do you structure your folders? How do you have it nested?

How do you have it organized there? And code and AI loves that type of structure. So the one thing that I've been doing is I've been using Obsidian. I have my own vault. It's actually our vault. So I've got the Luminous vault or the Confluent vault. So I have two vaults that you guys have access to. I don't know if you have access to Confluent, but more interesting is Luminous. And all you do is you set up your folder structure there. Now, if you have documents that are not in a text format, all you do is just pump it into your chat GPT or whatever, say, can you please put this into a markdown folder that I want to put into my Obsidian vault?

And I would like it to be human-readable, but I want to have wiki links so AI can read it. So AI can read it. Those are the two things that I do that are really important. So first of all, you want a human readable so you can read your file. It's in Markdown format, which is kind of nice. But then you actually have Wiki links. And what you ask for it to do is you want to start to get all of your files in your folder to be linked together. So when you actually have AI looking at these folders from the tool that we're going to show you how to use, it starts to correlate the data.

This is also where I also say this was a great session. I would like to capture this in a master context file and write to it. And I want this file to be continuously improved. So I want you to purge the old stuff that's irrelevant and to add the new things that we've learned and make sure that we've captured this as a memory, memory context file. So as you're going along, you come to an end of a session, just say fucking capture it in this file, point to that file, ready to roll. What that's also doing is it's making the agent smarter and smarter for you.

You have all of your stuff in readable format. And that now becomes an extension of your intelligence and your talents. Right. So I need to do this. I only I'm sure when I do it, I'll be like blown away. But I can't vision. I can't imagine. It'll get better and better and better and better the more you use it. So so you have to invest the time. You have to be patient. And you have to kind of look at it from a very structured perspective of where like almost segment your fucking intelligence and your knowledge into files and folders.

Right. So if you actually look at how you operate your lab, how you operate your research, how do you organize your file folders? Right. So I don't bio sensors and fucking well. And here there's research papers and different things. And the cheat code. The cheat code to that is you could just have a bunch of information is dumping into a bucket. Like you got like a folder, you got a folder, the folders, a bucket, just chuck everything into there. And then you ask the agent, Hey, can you help me organize this?

Create like structure all of this hierarchically for me in an organized fashion, you know, create the structure, move the files into the into the right structure. So you can at least shortcut a lot of that manual work just by getting it to do some of that initial heavy lifting. But to actually get you set up like this. So you need a piece of free software, but you're going to need a couple of paid. You need a couple of paid, paid accounts. I think you should try anti-gravity. Anti-gravity was fucking super simple to get going.

Yeah. You just got to get a Gemini license. And it's good to have a cloud code license. You need like I would say you don't need it, but it's good to have cloud code and Gemini writing side by side because you can kind of play them off of each other. But doesn't cloud have to be like 150 bucks a month to do the, or a hundred bucks a month for the agent side? Like Gemini was good about it. I didn't need a version for Gemini. My use case is a little different because like I do need critical feedback, like, like to make this, to make a lot of this stuff work.

So, I mean, my, like I, I spend, I spend too much money on this stuff a month, but it's not too much money when I think about what I'm able to do in the period of time I'm able to do it. Like I probably, I spend $32 a month. How should I spend my money? I buy chat GPT. That's what I do. Yeah. So I, so I, like I spend 300 bucks a month on cloud code and I spend another $250 on Gemini. So I spend about $600. You spend 250 bucks a month on Gemini? Yeah. Holy fuck. How do you do that? I've got a $25 a month Gemini.

I've never freaking had a world subscription. So the subscription I got, like it has like, well, because I run out of, I run out of, I quickly run out of token like space, right? Like, like you're throttled. You can only do, you can only do so many of these queries in a period of time. Like I max out those limitations, like in the first 15 minutes of a, of a day. Right? So Sean, Sean, have a look for anti-gravity. It's Google's anti-gravity. What would that be used for? Just go on your Google search and look for anti-gravity.

So that's your, anti-gravity? So anti-gravity is a, a software development environment. It's called an integrated development environment. But basically it's kind of this application that allows you to browse files and folders. And then, and write code. But in the case of anti-gravity, Google's got their, their, their newest Gemini models kind of built into it. So you fire up anti-gravity, Google Gemini can now, is now part of that environment. And then it can see your files and folders and you can just start, like inside of that environment, you can start working with your material.

You don't have to go to the internet or anything like that. It can have long running kind of agentic processes. Um, this, this, this organization project has been my greatest unfulfilled desire of the last 20 years. So I feel like I need to do it because there's so many pockets of space. What do you mean? Luminous? No, my lack of organization. So what you're talking about is a solution to the problem where I can make sense more of the information I have. Because I'm not using, I'm using it like a fucking, it's like, I might as well have everything on paper and pencil because this is what I fucking do day in and day out.

And it's just, it's horrible. Yeah, it's going to take some time, but it's going to be a good use of your time going forward. Okay. Budgetary wise, is it just anti-gravity will do it? No, you just need a Google license. You need a Google pro license. And I think it's 25, I don't know if it's US or Canadian or 26 bucks US or Canadian per month. And I fucking love Gemini. Now I, I haven't gone back to, to chat GPT, but I hear it's good too. So I use Claude, which is a hundred or 150 bucks a month. And I use Gemini.

Those are my two that I use and it's sufficient. And the reason I like two is because you can actually take your output from Gemini and give it to Claude or vice versa. And they actually see different things and they actually start to build on each other and they like to collaborate. Hey, I got this from fucking Claude. What do you think of it? What do you like about it? What you don't like about it? What would you change? How would you change the tone? Like you always want to say tone, you know, I need brutal honesty.

Don't fucking lie. And it just goes, Oh, this is really good, but I would fucking add this. And you're like, and then I throw it back to Claude and goes, this is what Gemini thought from your fucking response. And Claude's going, well, that was really good fucking advice, you know? And then, but, but, and then you ask it to challenge each other as well, right? Well, I didn't like that for this reason. And Gemini might not have had that context, but you need to be the guy who's freaking, you're kind of the referee.

You're kind of pulling it all together and you don't have enough intelligence. The question is, are you, are you okay spending a couple hundred bucks a month on this, at least to give it a try? Like if you are, like we can, we can get you set up. Like, like we can do a screen, a screen share session and we can help you. Like we can get this environment set up for you. Yeah. I think I'm, yeah, I'll try. It's a, it'll be a force multiplier. Like once, once it starts to click and you're using it, it's like, you're going to find that you're able to do like, I'm not, I shit you not like an order of magnitude more in a given period of time.

And it doesn't mean you have to even do more work. Like you can just do more better in less time. Yeah. Yeah. That's what I'm, yeah. Fuck it. Um, I, cause everything that I do is building and, and I'm, it's relying on my own memory and I'm fucking, I can't manage all the information anymore. I also use a, uh, I use it a lot when I'm by myself, not so much when there's other people around, but I have a, I use a dictation tool called super whisper. And, uh, I got it installed on my Mac and on my phone. Um, cause I will talk a lot instead of typing cause it's just faster.

And what I've got good at that yet. I've got to still try to, but what I find, what I find too is like in these sessions, I might, I might, I might get to a, like kind of a, um, sort of a, um, a checkpoint in the, in a, in a conversation where it's asking me, this thing is asking me a bunch of questions before it can proceed, right? It needs answers. So what I find I do is that like all those are great situations for me to talk to talk with super whisper because I can be reading the questions and I can be sort of speaking, like talking the, like giving it direction and answers at the same time.

And it just takes that as textual input and it's way more effective. And I can get, I can pack way more context into a voice, a voice input than I can just just typing on the keyboard. Those things, I use them all the time. I might give that a try. Um, I got to get some food. I need another coffee, but I need you guys thinking about budget, please. And it's really broad strokes. Like Sean, how much time would Tyson have from May to December? Or do you have him fucking booked for a lot of his time? Um, could we have half of him and half of his sister or something to that effect?

Or you know what I mean? Well, right now my funding ends in June. And, um, so I don't have anything planned for May to September. No, but you're expecting NSERC to come in, right? Yeah. So, and, and the matching funds from CNRL. So he will have time to do the work from what I can tell. And. And. What about his sister? Would we get her sort of part-time? Like, do we need... We could hire her too. She might be interested, yeah. Or someone else. And this isn't fucking academic wages, right? Like, I need to get a budget on what they would be happy with.

Is it 80 grand a year equivalent? Is it 100 grand a year equivalent? I don't know, but I'd need to know these numbers. Oh. Oh, okay. Well, if Tyson were hired by me, you could just give him a top-up. And I'm fine for him to do this work in an academic context, but it's mainly for Luminous. Anyways, yeah, I know what you're saying. Okay, so I need that sooner than later, if you guys don't mind. What you would require, also equipment, Sean. And I don't give a fuck what you're getting for the U.S.C. through your academic funding.

Give me an idea of what's the best fucking camera that you need and what's the best equipment to grow the bugs and do this stuff so we have highly reliable fucking quality control testing, right? Because if we're doing a pilot, we want to make sure that our output is even better than what you've been doing in the past, right? So, yeah, that would be awesome because it's skeletal like what we're using. We don't even own that camera. We don't even own the camera that takes the pictures of the Petri dish.

We borrow that thing. So we need to know about that as well because these are things that I want to say, these are the pieces we need to, and this gives me a reason to have commitments earlier for the pilot as opposed to later, right? So on that, like getting our budget is important, obviously, and you want to be ready for spring. But how do we negotiate this with CNRL? They said they're interested. We also know that they budgeted their year already. So they're going to find the money. We have to anticipate that they'll find the money if they see the value, right?

And if we can get, you know, here's the thing. We're just doing it for costs and it's not going to be a lot of money. Here's what we're going to give you. Here's the efficiencies and the insights that we think you're going to drive. So that's the case I have to build. And oh, by the way, Alberta Innovates is going to be fucking half of this, right? And if this works, we can just keep rolling, right? And then we figure out what commercial terms looks like afterwards. And CNRL is going to be pricks and try to, you know, want preferential pricing and all that.

I'm like, fuck off. Like, like, let's see what we can deliver you. And then we'll figure that out in the future. But let's pilot it. And you also said something that struck me where they will have access to the database and they can query it and they will have the knowledgeable query. So they will fucking, they will get so much value out of it because they will know what's going on. I'm going to ask it. Yep. So that's another thing I want you to start to think about, Sean, is how you want to report this into the data model that Greg's going to create.

And what was other really interesting things? So like in my assumptions, it's how you're flowing water through temperature, location, time of year, right? Because that was another thing that came out of the curl. Like it was the degradation and probably the July 25th was probably the best because that's, you know, and we, we gather this type of data. Like we, we gathered a bunch of stuff from the curl wetland that helped us come up with some decisional points there. But what are you going to do for dosing?

Because that was another thing that they were doing on curl wetland is they were actually doing some dosing, but they were just doing it based on, we think we should do this. Oh, no, they did it based on they ran out the water evaporated. So they had to add more. Well, that was dosing. But they also added some other. Oh, it's like fucking bio luminescent stuff that you put into the water that lights up. That's what the shit was. They were doing some kind of dosing to see toxicity of the water in play. Yeah, I fucking looked up this.

You know what I mean? Like, and they had that on the curl wetland report, right? So they don't know what you're talking about. Actually, I guess there's some shit that you're doing. You throw it into the water and the bio, it'll actually light up to show certain toxicity levels. No, no, that sounds like a nano, H2 nano throwing something in the water. I was saying, Jeff, while you're looking for that, I want to make another coffee. But Sean, do you want to get together like after lunch and I can help you get this environment set up?

Yeah, let me just double check my schedule. I have a few meetings. I got the day open. So just give me a block of time maybe this afternoon and we'll just spend an hour. We'll get it set up. And then just have your credit card ready too because we'll have to get you a couple subscriptions. Okay, I have a meeting at 2. So it's like late afternoon. 2 till late. Is it a short meeting or a long meeting? It's probably, it's an hour. Okay, well, ping me after that. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, we'll get you set up. Okay. Okay. If I find it, Sean, I'll let you know what it was.

Okay, yeah. I have a stupid Christmas party for AU in 11 o'clock my time where everyone's wearing fucking goofy hats and pajamas and fucking pretending to have an actual Christmas party. It's so fucking lame. Online? It's like they have the equivalent of small town 1980s Christmas parties themes on a fucking Zoom Teams meeting. And they've been doing it for years. Like they circulated a recipe book that they made a few Christmases ago where everyone sent in a fucking recipe and someone made a cheesy PowerPoint presentation with background images.

And that was all their family recipes. And it's like, this is fucking ridiculous. I might as well be sending everyone pickled beets for Christmas gifts and shit. It's just like, so nerdy. Anyways. Well, this has been interesting and we'll, I'll talk to you. I'll ping you later, Greg. Yeah, let's chat at three.
