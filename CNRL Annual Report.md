## Letter to Shareholders

In 2023, we delivered on our capital allocation strategy by strengthening our balance sheet, providing significant returns to shareholders and strategically developing our assets66. Our culture of continuous improvement, focus on cost control and disciplined capital allocation continues to drive strong operational and financial results, maximizing value for our shareholders67.

We achieved record annual average daily production of 1,332 MBOE/d in 2023, an increase of 4% from 2022 levels, or 7% growth on a production per share basis68. We delivered strong financial results in 2023, including adjusted funds flow of $15.3 billion and significant free cash flow of approximately $6.9 billion69.

In the past three years, we have reduced our net debt by over $11 billion and delivered approximately $21.5 billion directly to shareholders through $11.0 billion in dividends and $10.5 billion in share repurchases70. We ended 2023 with approximately $9.9 billion in net debt, achieving our net debt level of $10 billion71. As per our free cash flow allocation policy, we will now target to return 100% of free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks72.

In 2023, the Board of Directors approved two separate increases to our quarterly dividend, for a combined increase of 18% to $1.00 per common share73. Subsequent to year end, in February of 2024, the Board of Directors approved an additional 5% increase to the quarterly dividend to $1.05 per common share, or $4.20 per common share on an annual basis74. The Company has a leading track record of 24 consecutive years of dividend increases, with a compound annual growth rate of 21% over that time period75.

In February 2024, our Board of Directors approved a resolution to subdivide the Company's common shares on a two for one basis76. The proposal will be voted on at the Company's Annual and Special Meeting of Shareholders to be held on May 2, 202477.

### Operations and ESG

Canadian Natural is committed to supplying safe, reliable and responsible energy, along with reducing our environmental footprint78. We are committed to supporting Canada's and Alberta's climate goals and continue to reduce our environmental footprint with our robust environmental targets, including net zero GHG emissions in the oil sands by 205079.

From 2019 to 2023, we have abandoned 11,368 inactive wells and received 4,712 reclamation certificates, representing 10,014 hectares of reclaimed land80. In 2023, we worked with 221 Indigenous businesses through which approximately $830 million in contracts were awarded, a 21% increase from 2022 levels81.

## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

(tabular amounts in millions of Canadian dollars, unless otherwise stated) 1

### 1. Accounting Policies

Canadian Natural Resources Limited (the "Company") is a senior independent crude oil and natural gas exploration, development and production company2. The Company's exploration and production operations are focused in North America, largely in Western Canada; the United Kingdom ("UK") portion of the North Sea; and Côte d'Ivoire and South Africa in Offshore Africa3.

** (A) Principles of Consolidation** The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and all of its subsidiary companies and wholly owned partnerships4. Subsidiaries include all entities over which the Company has control5. Certain of the Company's activities are conducted through joint arrangements6. Where the Company has a direct ownership interest in jointly controlled assets and obligations, it is a "joint operation"7. Where it has an interest in jointly controlled entities, it is a "joint venture" and uses the equity method of accounting8.

** (B) Inventory** Inventory is primarily comprised of product inventory, materials and supplies and other inventory, including emissions credits, and is carried at the lower of cost and net realizable value9. Cost of product inventory consists of purchase costs, direct production costs, directly attributable overhead and depletion, depreciation and amortization10.

** (C) Exploration and Evaluation Assets** Exploration and evaluation ("E&E") assets consist of the Company's crude oil and natural gas exploration projects that are pending the determination of proved reserves11. E&E costs are initially capitalized and include costs directly associated with the acquisition of licenses, technical services, seismic acquisition, and exploration drilling12.

** (D) Property, Plant and Equipment** Property, plant and equipment is measured at cost less accumulated depletion and depreciation and recoverability charges1314. 15Crude oil and natural gas properties are depleted using the unit-of-production method over proved reserves1617.18

** (G) Asset Retirement Obligations**19 The Comp20any provides for asset retirement obligations on all of its property, plant and equipment and certain exploration and evaluation assets based on current legislation and operating practices21. Provisions are measured at the present value of management's best estimate of expenditures required to settle the obligation22.
