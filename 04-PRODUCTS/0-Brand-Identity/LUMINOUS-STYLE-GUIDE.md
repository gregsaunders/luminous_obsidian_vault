# Luminous BioSolutions Visual Style Guide

## Core Visual Philosophy: "Engineered Clarity"

Our visuals must bridge the gap between organic biology and heavy industry. They should feel like high-end technical photography or sophisticated engineering diagrams, not conceptual art. The aesthetic is robust, functional, and brightly illuminated from within.

---

## 1. Color Palette Strategy

Balance the reality of the environment with the "luminous" clarity of the solution.

| Theme | Colors | Represents |
|-------|--------|------------|
| **Primary (Water & Clarity)** | Deep aquamarines, cerulean blues, clean teals | Treated water, "clear path forward" |
| **Secondary (Infrastructure & Data)** | Muted steel greys, brushed aluminum, technical matte white, charcoal | Industrial reality, lab setting |
| **Accent/Signal (Bio-Data)** | Glowing **Amber/Gold** | Biosensor signal, NAFC detection |

**Note:** The amber accent is glowing but cautionary—not alarmist red.

---

## 2. Lighting & Mood

- **"Luminous" is literal:** Light source often comes *from the technology itself* or from within the water
- **Subdued Environment:** Background slightly darker/diffused to make data and water clarity pop
- **No Sci-Fi Neon:** Avoid cyberpunk aesthetics (hot pinks, saturated purples). Glow should feel biological (firefly) or technical (clean LED), not magical

---

## 3. Compositional Elements

- **Macro/Micro Fusion:** Show microscopic biology and macroscopic industrial site in same visual language
- **Data Overlay:** Software/Confluent diagrams look like advanced SCADA interfaces—clean lines, translucent data points, sans-serif fonts—overlaying physical world

## The Master Style Append

**Copy/paste this at the end of EVERY prompt:**

> **... aesthetic style: Industrial biomimicry, photorealistic technical clarity, engineered robustness. Color Palette: Deep aquamarine and cerulean blues, technical white, muted steel greys, with glowing amber bio-signal accents. Lighting: Internal bioluminescence, glowing water, subdued ambient environment. Mood: Professional, reliable, data-driven, 'engineer-safe' reality. No sci-fi neon, no cartoon elements.**

## Application Examples

### Scenario 1: Product Shot - The Biosensor ("The Mine Detector")

**Use case:** Hero shot of hardware for offsite lab

**Prompt:**
> A macro photograph of a ruggedized biosensor cartridge submerged in a glass beaker of process water. The water inside the sensor chambers is glowing with a soft amber light, indicating detection. The casing is brushed aluminum and technical white plastic. The background is a clean, out-of-focus laboratory bench. **[PASTE MASTER STYLE APPEND]**

### Scenario 2: Diagrammatic - The Confluent Platform ("The Map")

**Use case:** Visualize toxicity-to-weather correlation

**Prompt:**
> A technical diagram showing a cross-section of an oil sands wetland. Overlaid on the landscape is a translucent data visualization dashboard. On the left, a graph shows a spike in amber light labeled "Toxicity Panel 2." A connecting line links this spike to a weather icon showing heavy rain and a data point showing "Flow Rate Increase." The lines are clean, technical, and glowing blue and amber. **[PASTE MASTER STYLE APPEND]**

---

### Scenario 3: Storytelling - The Transition

**Use case:** Visualize shift from containment to release

**Prompt:**
> A split-screen photograph. On the left side, a murky, stagnant industrial pond under grey skies, with a heavy steel gate closed. On the right side, separated by a glowing blue data stream, the same pond is clear, brightly lit from within the water, and water is flowing through an open gate into a natural creek. The overall feeling is a transition from dark stagnation to engineered clarity. **[PASTE MASTER STYLE APPEND]**

## Prompt Library

Store successful prompts in `prompts/` folder:
- `product-shots.md` - Hardware, sensors, lab equipment
- `diagrams.md` - Platform visualizations, data flows
