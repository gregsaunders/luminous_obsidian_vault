# Discovery Scripts: Validating the "Sensor-Led" Value

**Last Updated:** November 29, 2025
**Version:** 2.0 (Post-CDL Mentor Refinement)

**Goal:** Validate the pain of the "Blind Spot" (HRMS Lag) first. Then, validate the need for the Platform to manage the new data speed.

**Strategy:** Sell the "Eyes" first, then the "Brain."

**Key Language Refinements:**
- "Fuel gauge" metaphor (resonates with operators)
- "Conservative safety factors" pain point (financial impact)
- "Driving blind through minefield" urgency visual
- "Manual spreadsheets" friction (time waste)

## 1. The "Blind Spot" Check (The Primary Wedge)
**Context:** We need to confirm that the 4-8 week lag in HRMS data is hurting their ability to operate.

**Jeff:** "We know everyone is watching NAFCs for the 2027 release guidelines. But right now, the standard lab turnaround is what... 4 to 8 weeks?"

**Jeff:** *"How do you actually manage your daily flow rates or retention times when your toxicity feedback is a month old? Are you just forced to run on conservative 'Safety Factors'?"*

**(If "Safety Factors"):**
**Jeff:** "That's exactly what our Biosensor solves. If we gave you a 'Fuel Gauge' for toxicity that updated every 48 hours instead of every 48 days, would you actually have the authority to optimize those flows, or are the setpoints locked in stone?"

**Jeff (Alternative Framing):** "You're essentially driving a billion-dollar treatment system blind through a minefield—you can't see what's happening in real-time, so you have to over-engineer every decision with expensive safety buffers."

**Validation Point:** Listen for pain around:
- Over-dosing chemicals "just to be safe"
- Shutting down operations early based on calendar dates vs. actual data
- Running equal flow to all cells without knowing which perform better
- Waiting weeks to find out if a treatment adjustment worked

## 2. The "Context Gap" Check (The Platform Upsell)
**Context:** Once they admit they want the Sensor data, we need to ensure they buy the Platform to manage it.

**Jeff:** "So let's say we install the Biosensor and you start getting daily toxicity spikes. A spike is great, but it doesn't tell you *why* it happened."

**Jeff:** *"Do you currently have a way to instantly overlay that biological data against your flow rates and weather from yesterday, or would that turn into a manual spreadsheet project for your team?"*

**(If "Manual"):**
**Jeff:** "That's the second half of our system. We don't just give you the sensor reading; our 'Relational Context Engine' automatically pulls your SCADA and Weather data so you can see *why* the toxicity spiked without digging through files."

**Jeff (Stronger Value Framing):** "Without the automated correlation, you'd be drowning in data without insights. Our platform answers the question 'Why did toxicity spike in Cell 3 on Tuesday?' in minutes, not hours of manual spreadsheet work."

**Validation Point:** Listen for frustration around:
- Time spent manually compiling data for monthly reports
- Difficulty correlating events across different data systems
- Lack of institutional memory (knowledge walks out the door when senior engineers leave)
- Inability to answer "what happened when" questions quickly

## 3. The Caustic Savings Hypothesis (Sensor-Enabled)
**Context:** Validating the chemical savings upside.

**Jeff:** "We have a hypothesis that you might be over-dosing caustic because you have to assume the water is always toxic. But our Kearl data showed that often, the water cleans itself naturally."

**Jeff:** *"If you had a daily 'Green Light' from our sensor proving the water was safe, would operations trust that enough to dial back the caustic dosing, or is that too risky with your current data gaps?"*

## 4. The "Trust Deficit" Check (Glass Box)
**Context:** Validating the Tier 3 Regulatory value.

**Jeff:** *"Looking ahead to 2027—when you show the Regulator your baseline data, are they going to trust a spreadsheet you compiled manually?"*

**Jeff:** "Part of our infrastructure is an immutable 'Glass Box' audit trail. It proves that the sensor data hasn't been touched or massaged. Is that chain-of-custody something you’re worried about yet?"
