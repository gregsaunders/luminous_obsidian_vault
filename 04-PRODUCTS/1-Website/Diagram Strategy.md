### Part 3: "Google Nano Banana" (Diagram Strategy)

I will assume "Nano Banana" is your visualization/diagram generation tool. Here are the **Prompt Concepts** and descriptions you need to generate to visualize the "Wisdom" and "Optimization."

**Diagram 1: The Specificity Gap (The "Mic Drop")**

- **Concept:** A side-by-side comparison of FTIR vs. Luminous on a graph.
    
- **Visual:**
    
    - Left Side (FTIR): Shows two tall bars. One is "Toxic NAs," one is "Safe Humics." Both bars are the same height/color because FTIR can't tell them apart. Label: "False Positive Risk."
        
    - Right Side (Luminous): Shows one tall bar ("Toxic NAs") and one flat line ("Safe Humics").
        
    - **Prompt/Instruction:** "Create a bar chart comparison. Left side 'FTIR': High signal for both Naphthenic Acid and Humic Acid. Right side 'Luminous Biosensor': High signal for Naphthenic Acid, Zero signal for Humic Acid. Style: Clean, scientific, technical white paper aesthetic."
        

**Diagram 2: The Geo-Spatial Optimization (The "Deep View")**

- **Concept:** Moving from single-point sampling (FTIR) to a heat map (Luminous).
    
- **Visual:**
    
    - Image A (Old Way): A map of a tailings pond with one single green dot (Sample Point).
        
    - Image B (Luminous Way): The same map, but overlaid with a gradient 'heat map' (Red to Green) showing toxicity hotspots across the entire surface, derived from high-frequency grid sampling.
        
    - **Prompt/Instruction:** "Topographic map of a tailings pond. Overlay a semi-transparent heat map showing toxicity concentration gradients. Red zones near the inlet, fading to green at the outlet. Grid points showing sampling locations. Label: 'Geo-Spatial Toxicity Resolution'."
        

**Diagram 3: The Context Engine (The "Why")**

- **Concept:** Correlating toxicity with operations.
    
- **Visual:** A dual-axis line chart.
    
    - Line 1 (Red): Toxicity Level (spiking and dropping).
        
    - Line 2 (Blue): Flow Rate or Temperature.
        
    - Callout Box: "Insight: Toxicity spike correlates with temperature drop < 10°C, not process failure."
        
    - **Prompt/Instruction:** "Dual-axis technical line chart. Primary Y-axis: Biosensor Response (RLU). Secondary Y-axis: Water Temperature (°C). Show inverse correlation. Annotate specific data point with 'Operational Insight'."
