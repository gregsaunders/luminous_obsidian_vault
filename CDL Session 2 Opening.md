### Session 2 Opening: Progress Update

Since our last session, we’ve shifted from proving the science to narrowing in on a business case that’s ready for an executive-level conversation. We’ve grounded our progress in three key areas:

1. **Quantifying Long-term Liability** Working with our CDL MBA associate, Max Zhang, we’ve integrated **Asset Retirement Obligation (ARO)** impact into our value positioning. By providing faster data and better insights, we’re showing a path to compress remediation timelines. This isn't just about daily monitoring; it’s about moving into a new persona within our prospects, the teams managing long-term environmental liabilities.

2. **Validating Toxicity vs. Concentration** - Our recent findings from the multi-season Kearl Wetland Pilot have been highly encouraging, particularly regarding our performance against the "Gold Standard" of high-resolution Mass Spectrometry. These head-to-head tests demonstrate strong alignment with industry benchmarks, and we expect to finalize our formal paper by **February 5**.
   
   Equally significant is our whole-cell biosensor’s ability to measure toxicity - a topic of increasing industry focus. The Kearl Pilot data revealed that even while Naphthenic Acid (NA) concentrations remained high, the toxic components were the first to be mitigated by the wetland. Because our sensors utilize **whole cells**, they offer a unique, highly specific advantage in measuring biological toxicity rather than just chemical presence. This represents a major milestone for our technology.

2. **Establishing Operational Baselines** Our analysis of the initial Kearl Wetland Pilot revealed significant operational inefficiencies caused by infrequent testing and a lack of relational context. Currently, engineers operate with infrequent testing and a **6–8 week data lag**, forcing them to "over-engineer" or default to overly conservative safety margins. This lack of real-time insight results in substantial waste.

3. **Pipeline & Strategic Outreach** On the business development front, we are deliberately moving up the value chain.
	- **CNRL:** We have a warm path to the Senior VP of Operations through Dave Lee’s network. We have held back on that meeting intentionally; we only get one chance to pitch at that level, and we are ensuring our narrative is rock-solid and defensible before we step in that room.
	    
	- **Suncor:** Jocelyn has attempted outreach to her contacts there. They’ve been unresponsive thus far, but we are continuing to refine our messaging to break through.
    
4. **AU Tech transfer and Partnerships** - Finally, We have secured a **Letter of Intent** for the IP transfer and licensing with Athabasca University (AU), with a mutual commitment to expedite the process. AU views this partnership as a "relationship agreement," signaling a long-term collaborative interest in our success. To solidify our institutional credibility, we are currently in discussions regarding a joint press release to formally announce this alignment.

We are now focused on acting on our Session 1 objectives
