Genome Alberta, with support from the Government of Alberta, is investing **$1.5M** in new research collaborations to close the gap in scaling genomic innovations in support of broader application in Alberta’s energy sector for improved environmental outcomes.  
   
The [**Genomic Innovations: Energy and Environmental Solutions**](https://genomealberta.us20.list-manage.com/track/click?u=35584a143552dd360d801777e&id=9ec30c9ac1&e=3d135484cb "https://genomealberta.us20.list-manage.com/track/click?u=35584a143552dd360d801777e&id=9ec30c9ac1&e=3d135484cb") initiative will fund genomics-based research projects that aim to accelerate the development of adoptable outputs—products, processes, or applications derived from genomics technologies with clear potential for implementation within the energy sector. Applications will be accepted for projects that will help in reducing or assessing the environmental impact of energy operations and will promote environmental stewardship, including the areas of: 

- Bioremediation and reclamation of contaminated sites
- GHG emission reduction via microbial processes or bio-based carbon capture
- Biodiversity assessment and ecological monitoring using eDNA tools
- Clean technology development (e.g. hydrogen production, carbon storage)
- Optimization of processes that limit environmental risk (e.g. corrosion prevention, water treatment)
