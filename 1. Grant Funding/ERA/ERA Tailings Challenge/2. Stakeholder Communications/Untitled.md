### **Key Insight from Workshop**

The workshop revealed a critical gap: while HRMS is the gold standard, there's a recognized need for "quick and dirty" mass testing methods, but **no viable solution was presented**. Your biosensors fill this exact gap.

### **Strategic Positioning**

**Don't compete with HRMS, complement it.** Position biosensors as the essential screening tool that makes HRMS more efficient and cost-effective.

**Subject:** Educational Workshop Proposal - Biosensor Technology for NA Screening

Dear Heather,

Thank you for organizing the comprehensive NA measurement methods workshop. The discussion highlighted the challenge the community faces: HRMS provides the gold standard accuracy, but practical implementation requires mass testing capabilities that current methods cannot economically deliver.

**Addressing the "Quick and Dirty" Need:** Several participants mentioned the need for rapid screening methods. We've developed peer-reviewed bacterial biosensors specifically for NA detection that could address this gap. Rather than replacing HRMS, our technology could serve as a cost-effective screening tool to optimize HRMS usage.

**Educational Workshop Proposal:** We'd like to propose a focused educational session on "Biosensors as Screening Tools for NA Management" that would:

- Demonstrate how biosensors complement existing HRMS workflows
- Show correlation data between biosensor results and mass spectrometry
- Discuss integration strategies for labs already invested in HRMS technology
- Address the practical need for high-throughput screening identified in your workshop

**Scientific Validation:** Our technology is published in ACS Synthetic Biology and has been field-tested alongside HRMS at the Imperial Oil Kearl wetland pilot, showing comparable results for screening applications.

Would you be open to discussing how we might contribute to the community's understanding of complementary measurement approaches?

Best regards, Jeff Violo

**Subject:** Novel NA Measurement Technology - Regulatory Considerations

Dear Andrea,

Following the recent NA measurement methods workshop, I wanted to ensure you're aware of a complementary technology that could support the Oil Sands Mine Water Steering Committee's Recommendation 5 for standardized NA measurement.

**Regulatory Context:** While the workshop focused on HRMS standardization, practical implementation of any NA monitoring program will require:

- High-frequency testing across multiple sites
- Cost-effective screening to optimize expensive HRMS usage
- Real-time feedback for treatment optimization
- Accessible technology for smaller operators and consultants

**Biosensor Technology Overview:** We've developed bacterial biosensors for NA detection that:

- Deliver results in hours vs. weeks for HRMS
- Cost ~90% less per sample than HRMS
- Require minimal technical training (chemistry diploma vs. PhD)
- Show comparable results to HRMS for screening applications
- Are field-deployable for on-site testing

**Regulatory Alignment:** This technology could support the standardization goals by:

- Providing consistent screening protocols across operators
- Enabling high-frequency monitoring for regulatory compliance
- Offering cost-effective validation of treatment effectiveness
- Supporting smaller operators who cannot afford extensive HRMS infrastructure

**Scientific Validation:** Published in ACS Synthetic Biology and field-validated at Imperial Oil's Kearl wetland alongside HRMS methods.

**Request:** Would you be interested in a brief technical briefing on how biosensor technology could complement the standardized HRMS methods being considered? We believe this could enhance the practical implementation of Recommendation 5.

Best regards, Jeff Violo

## **Key Messages for All Communications**

### **For Scientists:**

- "Biosensors don't replace HRMS—they make HRMS smarter and more efficient"
- "Think of biosensors as the 'rapid antigen test' for NA detection—quick screening that guides when to use the 'PCR test' (HRMS)"

### **For Regulators:**

- "Enables practical implementation of continuous monitoring requirements"
- "Provides accessible technology for all operators, not just major companies"
- "Supports standardization through consistent screening protocols"

### **For Government:**

- "Addresses the practical gap between regulatory requirements and technical feasibility"
- "Supports smaller operators and consulting firms in compliance efforts"
- "Enables real-time treatment optimization to accelerate remediation"

**The key is positioning biosensors as the essential bridge between regulatory requirements and practical implementation—not as competition to HRMS, but as the technology that makes HRMS programs actually workable at scale.**
