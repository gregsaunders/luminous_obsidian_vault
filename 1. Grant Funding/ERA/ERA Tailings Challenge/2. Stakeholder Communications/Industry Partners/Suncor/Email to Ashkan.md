Hi Ashkan,

Thank you again for the productive meeting last week. I appreciate your feedback and your offer to socialize our work internally at Suncor.

As discussed, I've put together a brief, forwardable summary below that outlines our solution. It's framed by two recent, peer-reviewed publications that we believe create a timely opportunity for the industry.

--- 
**The Challenge & A Validated Opportunity:** The recently published Kearl Wetland study confirmed that while nature-based systems are a promising start (achieving 36% NA degradation), they have a documented performance gap where degradation rates slow significantly over time.

**The Luminous BioSolutions Platform:** Our company, founded by 30-year microbiologist Dr. Shawn Lewenza, has developed an integrated platform to solve this exact problem.

- **1. Validated Monitoring:** Our core biosensor technology, published in the peer-reviewed journal _ACS Synthetic Biology_, provides NA data in minutes, not weeks. In field testing at the Kearl pilot, its performance was comparable to mass spectrometry, enabling the high-frequency data needed to effectively manage remediation.
    
- **2. Targeted Remediation:** We use our biosensor to screen and identify the most effective, naturally-occurring NA-degrading bacteria from a specific water source. Our bioaugmentation service then deploys these "specialist" microbes to enhance natural systems and address the performance gap identified at Kearl.

**Next Steps & The ERA Opportunity:**

We have a fully-scoped pilot project ready for the new ERA Tailings Technology Challenge. This grant provides a capital-efficient, low-risk opportunity for an industry partner to validate this integrated solution at scale.

Based on your suggestion that this might be a better fit for another group, would you be able to forward this summary to your colleagues?

Separately, I would also like to ask if you might know who within Suncor would be the right person to discuss a potential partnership for the ERA Challenge. An introduction would be greatly appreciated.

Even if the full remediation platform is a better fit elsewhere, we believe the biosensor alone could provide significant value to your team's current monitoring efforts, and I'm happy to continue that conversation separately.

Thanks again for your time and guidance.

Best regards,
