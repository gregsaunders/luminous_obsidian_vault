Subject: The ROI on your NA Biosensor Investment & a New ERA Opportunity

Dear Joy,

I'm reaching out as one of the co-founders and COO of Luminous BioSolutions, the company recently formed to commercialize the successful Naphthenic Acid biosensor technology that you and CNR championed at the university level a decade ago.

I know our CSO, Dr. Shawn Lewenza, reached out recently with a scientific update. I'm following up from a commercial and strategic perspective because the technology has reached a critical inflection point, and we believe there is a timely and compelling opportunity for CNR.

In short, your initial investment has paid off significantly. The biosensor technology has now been fully validated in the field and published in the world-leading peer-reviewed journal, _ACS Synthetic Biology_. This success was the catalyst for us to build a platform designed to solve the documented performance gaps in tailings remediation, such as those identified in the recent Kearl wetland study. (both papers attached)

The new ERA Tailings Technology Challenge now provides the perfect, capital-efficient vehicle for CNR to lead the commercial deployment of this homegrown innovation. It offers a low-risk, co-funded pathway to turn your foundational R&D investment into a tangible operational and ESG win.

I would be grateful for the opportunity to have a brief call with you to discuss the strategic value of this partnership and how it aligns with CNR's innovation and reclamation goals.

Thank you for your foundational vision and support. We believe we have reached the outcome you originally hoped for and are excited about the next steps.

Best regards,


The new **ERA Tailings Technology Challenge** provides the perfect, low-risk funding vehicle to validate this integrated solution at scale. Our proposed **$8M pilot project** is eligible for a 1-to-1 match from ERA, creating a uniquely capital-efficient opportunity for industry partners to co-fund a solution to one of their most significant challenges. The project is structured over four years with milestone-based funding, significantly de-risking the investment."
