Subject: The ROI on your NA Biosensor Investment & a New ERA Opportunity

Dear Joy,

I'm reaching out as one of the co-founders of Luminous BioSolutions, the company recently formed to commercialize the successful Naphthenic Acid biosensor technology that you and CNR championed at Athabasca University a decade ago.

I know our CSO, Dr. Shawn Lewenza, reached out recently with a scientific update, I'm following up from a commercial perspective.  The technology has reached a critical inflection point, and we believe there is a compelling opportunity for CNR.

Your initial investment has paid off significantly!  The biosensor has been fully validated in the field and published in the world leading peer reviewed journal, _ACS Synthetic Biology_.  This success was the catalyst for us to build a platform designed to solve the documented performance gaps in tailings remediation that were identified in the recent Kearl wetland study (both papers attached).

The Emissions Reduction Alberta (ERA) Recently released their Tailings Technology Challenge which is a excellent capital-efficient vehicle for CNR to lead the commercial deployment of this homegrown innovation. It offers a low-risk, co-funded pathway to turn your R&D investment into a tangible operational and ESG win.

We would be grateful for an opportunity to have a  call with you and your team to discuss the ERA's Tailings Technology Challenge, what our planned submission delivers, and how what CNR's innovation and reclamation goals.

Thank you for your foundational vision and support. We believe we have reached the outcome you originally hoped for and are excited about the next steps.

Best regards,


The new **ERA Tailings Technology Challenge** provides the perfect, low-risk funding vehicle to validate this integrated solution at scale. Our proposed **$8M pilot project** is eligible for a 1-to-1 match from ERA, creating a uniquely capital-efficient opportunity for industry partners to co-fund a solution to one of their most significant challenges. The project is structured over four years with milestone-based funding, significantly de-risking the investment."
