**Subject:** A Published Solution to the NA Remediation Gap & the ERA Tailings Challenge

Dear Theo and Jayne,

I'm reaching out to discuss the recently announced Emission Reduction Alberta (ERA) Tailings Technology Challenge and the opportunity for CNR to partner in our submission. 

To date, CNR has invested over $500,000 academic funding for the development of our Naphthenic Acid (NA) Biosensor, and it has proven successful in the lab, and the field (Kearl Constructed Wetland pilot). 

Our Biosensor tests results from the Kearl project were comparable to Mass Spec with our biosensor delivering results faster, easier to use, and significantly less expensive. 

The ERA application will fund a full scale up pilot that will validate our Bioaugmentation solution  works at "tailings ponds" scale, and a low risk, low cost environment to tune our solution.  Our solution is designed to compliment and accelerate existing remediation techniques like Constructed Wetlands or Solar Pass.   

We have a fully-scoped, systematic pilot project designed to validate this integrated approach at scale, leveraging existing Alberta infrastructure (UofC, Innotech).

Given the focus of the new ERA Tailings Technology Challenge, we believe a partnership would create a highly compelling submission. 

Could we schedule a brief technical discussion next week to review the our submission and explore how this project could benefit CNR?

Best regards,
