**Subject:** A Published Solution to the NA Remediation Gap & the ERA Tailings Challenge

**Dear [Contact Name],**

I'm writing to you to Discuss the Emission Reduction Alberta (because two recent publications present a clear, evidence-based opportunity to significantly advance tailings water remediation, and it aligns perfectly with the new ERA Tailings Technology Challenge.

In short, the data suggests a powerful synergy between our technologies and the industry's current trajectory:

- **The Problem is Validated:** The recently published **Kearl Wetland study** confirmed that while nature-based systems are a promising start, they have a documented performance gap, achieving a 36% NA reduction before degradation rates slow significantly.
    
- **Our Monitoring Solution is Validated:** Our core biosensor technology, which was field-tested at the Kearl pilot with results comparable to mass spectrometry, has now been **published in the peer-reviewed journal _ACS Synthetic Biology_**. This confirms we have a rapid, cost-effective tool to generate the high-resolution data needed to manage these systems effectively.
    
- **The Logical Next Step:** Our deep expertise in microbiology allows us to use the biosensor to identify and cultivate the most effective native NA-degrading bacteria. Deploying these as a targeted **bioaugmentation** service is the logical solution to address the performance gap identified at Kearl.
    

We have a fully-scoped, systematic pilot project designed to validate this integrated approach at scale, leveraging existing Alberta infrastructure (UofC, Innotech).

Given the focus of the new **ERA Tailings Technology Challenge**, we believe a partnership would create a highly compelling submission. Would you be open to a brief technical discussion next week to review the data from these papers and explore how this project could benefit [Their Company Name]?
