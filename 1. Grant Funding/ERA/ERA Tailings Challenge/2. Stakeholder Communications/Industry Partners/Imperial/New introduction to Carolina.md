**Subject:** Following up: The Kearl Wetland results & the new ERA Tailings Challenge

Dear Carolina,

I hope you are having a good summer.

I'm following up on our conversation from May. We were very excited to see the successful completion and recent publication of the Kearl Wetland study. Congratulations to you and the Imperial team on generating such valuable industry data.

The report's findings align perfectly with the work we are doing at Luminous. The study provides a clear, validation that nature-based systems are a promising start (achieving 36% NA degradation), while also identifying the key challenge of slowing degradation rates over time.

This is precisely the performance gap our bioaugmentation platform is designed to address. As we discussed, we use our biosensor to guide the deployment of specialized, native microbial teams. Our goal is to enhance and accelerate the natural degradation you've already proven is possible, pushing the results further towards reclamation targets.

The new ERA Tailings Technology Challenge seems tailor-made to pilot this "next phase." It provides a capital-efficient, co-funded opportunity to build on the success of the Kearl project and validate a low-risk, low-emission enhancement strategy.

Could we schedule a discussion next week? We would like to share our thoughts on how a partnership on the ERA submission could be a logical and highly beneficial next step for Imperial.

Best regards,
