**A Validated Alberta Tech Solution for Tailings (re: ERA Challenge)**

Mark,

We have had some very productive and helpful conversations with Mark Donner in your water innovation group as we've advanced our platform for tailings Naphthenic Acid (NA) remediation.

As we prepare our submission for the upcoming **ERA Tailings Technology Challenge**, I wanted to connect with you directly. We believe we have a significant, Alberta-grown success story that aligns perfectly with your mandate.

Our core biosensor technology is backed by a decade of local university research and recently published in the peer-reviewed journal, ACS Synthetic Biology. Crucially, it is designed to solve the key performance gaps that were recently identified in the independent, pilot-scale study of the Kearl constructed wetland (i.e., slowing degradation rates).

We are looking for an executive champion to help us navigate the ERA submission and secure the right industry partners. 

Would you be open to a brief 15-minute call next week to discuss if Luminous is a technology you would be willing to support at a strategic level?

Thank you,

**Jeff Violo**
