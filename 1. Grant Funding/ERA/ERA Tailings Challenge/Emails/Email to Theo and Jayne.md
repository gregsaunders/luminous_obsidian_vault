Based on Theo's email exchange with Shawn, this is a much warmer lead! Theo is clearly interested and proactive. Here's an email that builds on that momentum:

**Subject: ERA Tailings Technology Challenge - Meeting Request (Follow-up to Shawn's Update)**

Dear Theo and Jayne,

I'm Jeff Violo, co-founder of Luminous BioSolutions with Dr. Shawn Lewenza. Thank you, Theo, for your continued support and for connecting us with Jayne as CNR's new NA expert following Christine's leave.

**Following up on your June suggestion:** You mentioned the ERA oil sands water treatment and tailings call that came out this month—that's exactly the opportunity we want to discuss. The timing is perfect for our bioaugmentation technology.

**Quick recap of where we stand:**

- CNR's investment delivered: Peer-reviewed biosensor technology, field-validated at Kearl
- Natural next step: Bioaugmentation using the NA-degrading bacteria we've identified through biosensor screening
- Perfect timing: ERA Tailings Technology Challenge requires industry partners by September 24th

**Why this makes strategic sense for CNR:**

- **Low financial commitment:** 16.7% cost share with ERA covering 50% and three operators splitting remainder
- **Minimal operational impact:** Only OSPW samples and technical input required initially
- **De-risked approach:** Four-year scale-up from mesocosms to operational deployment with decision gates
- **Leverages your existing investment:** Direct progression from successful research to operational solution

**What we need:** A meeting with you and Jayne in the next two weeks to discuss partnership details and align on the proposal approach. Given Jayne's NA expertise, her input will be invaluable for crafting the technical approach.

The September 24th deadline is approaching quickly, and securing committed industry partners is critical for a competitive submission.

Are you available for a meeting early next week? I can come to Calgary or we can arrange a video call—whatever works best for your schedules.

Thank you for recognizing this technology's potential and guiding us toward the right funding opportunity.

Best regards,

Jeff Violo  
Co-founder & COO  
Luminous BioSolutions Inc.

**Why this works for Theo and Jayne:**

- **Acknowledges Theo's proactive suggestion** about the ERA call
- **Shows respect for their expertise** and operational focus
- **Builds on existing momentum** rather than starting from scratch
- **Clear, direct ask** with specific timeline
- **Technical focus** appropriate for their scientific background
- **Positions them as partners** in shaping the proposal, not just funders

This should get you the meeting since Theo already expressed interest and guided you toward this opportunity.
