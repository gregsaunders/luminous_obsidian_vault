**Subject: ERA Partnership - Leverage CNR's Biosensor Investment**

Dear Joy,

Congratulations on your Honorary Doctor of Science from Athabasca University—well deserved recognition.

I'm Jeff Violo, co-founder of Luminous BioSolutions with Dr. Shawn Lewenza. Following Shawn's scientific update, I wanted to discuss the immediate business opportunity that your biosensor investment has created.

**Bottom line: CNR's $500K investment delivered exactly what we promised.** Peer-reviewed technology, field-validated at Kearl, performing equivalent to mass spectrometry at fraction of the cost and time.

**The immediate opportunity:** ERA's Tailings Technology Challenge provides the perfect vehicle to scale this into operational deployment. The recent Oil Sands Mine Water Steering Committee Recommendation 5 calls for standardized NA measurement—exactly what you funded.

**Why this makes sense for CNR now:**

- **16.7%** cost share (ERA covers 50%, three operators split remainder)
- Minimal commitment: OSPW samples + technical input only
- Four-year scale-up with decision gates at each phase
- First-mover advantage on emerging regulations

**What I need:** 30 minutes with you and your team (perhaps including Theo, who expressed interest to Shawn) before the September 24th submission deadline.

This is the natural progression from successful research to operational solution—exactly what CNR envisioned with the original investment.

Available for a brief call this week?

Best regards,

Jeff Violo

**Why this works better from her perspective:**

- **Cuts to the chase immediately**
- **Uses "bottom line" language executives appreciate**
- **Quantifies the ask clearly (16.7%, 30 minutes)**
- **Creates urgency without pressure**
- **Shows respect for her time**
- **Positions as peer-level business discussion**

**Reader sentiment:** Professional appreciation without excessive flattery, focuses on mutual business benefit rather than asking for favors.

Would you prefer this streamlined approach, or shall we refine the longer version?
