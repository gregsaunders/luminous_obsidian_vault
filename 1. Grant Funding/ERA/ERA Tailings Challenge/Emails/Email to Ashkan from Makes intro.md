Hi Ashkan,

It's a pleasure to connect with you as well, and thank you for your interest.

Mark, thank you again for the kind introduction.

Ashkan, as Mark mentioned, our work stems from Dr. Shawn Lewenza’s NA biosensor research, which was validated in part through the GROW project at the Kearl Wetland. I’m reaching out to schedule the discussion you suggested. 

To give you some context for our conversation, our focus is on turning our scientific breakthroughs into a practical, integrated platform for tailings management.

There are two key pieces of recent, peer-reviewed science that frame our approach:

1. **Our Core Technology is Now Published:** Our Naphthenic Acid (NA) biosensor technology has been fully validated and the results were just published in the journal, ACS Synthetic Biology. We've proven its ability to rapidly detect NAs in raw OSPW samples. We also participated in the Kearl GROW wetland project and our Biosensor performed consistently with Mass Spec which was a great validation for us. We will release our paper on these results over the summer.

2. **A Key Industry Report Defines the Opportunity:** Separately, the multi-year study on the Kearl constructed wetland has also been published. The report confirms that wetlands are effective at degrading NAs, but it critically identifies that the degradation rate slows by more than 50% as the season progresses.

Our strategy is to directly solve the performance gap identified in the Kearl study. We use our rapid biosensors to guide a targeted bioaugmentation service, enhancing the natural microbial processes within these systems to maintain a higher, more consistent rate of NA degradation.

We believe this approach is the key to accelerating reclamation timelines.

Would you be available for a brief call next week to discuss this in more detail? We have the following times open:

- **Monday, July 1st (Afternoon)**
- **Tuesday, July 2nd (Afternoon)**
- **Wednesday, July 3rd (Morning)**

Please let us know if any of those times work for you. We look forward to the conversation.

Cheers,

Jeff

### **Why this email is effective:**

- **Professional Courtesy:** It thanks Mark and acknowledges Ashkan's reply promptly.
- **Scientifically Credible Hook:** It immediately frames the conversation around two recent, relevant, peer-reviewed publications—perfect for a scientific audience.
- **Clear Value Proposition:** It doesn't just describe the tech; it shows how the tech solves a specific, documented industry problem (the slowing degradation in wetlands).
- **Concise and Respectful of Time:** It provides just enough compelling detail to make the meeting worthwhile, without overwhelming him with information.
- **Clear Call to Action:** It offers specific, easy-to-accept meeting times, removing friction and making it simple for him to schedule.
- **Non-Sales Tone:** The language is about sharing scientific progress and discussing a solution to a shared industry problem, not about pushing a product.
