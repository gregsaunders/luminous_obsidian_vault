Dear Theo and Jayne,

I'm reaching out to discuss the recently announced ERA Tailings Technology Challenge and a timely opportunity for CNR to partner with us.

As you know, CNR's foundational funding was critical in developing our Naphthenic Acid (NA) biosensor. That technology has now been successfully field-tested at the Kearl Constructed Wetland pilot, with our results proving comparable to mass spectrometry, while being significantly faster and more cost-effective.

The recently published Kearl report (attached) provides a key insight: passive wetlands show promise but have a documented performance gap. Our bioaugmentation solution is designed to help address this issue. We use our biosensor to guide a targeted bioaugmentationservice, enhancing these natural systems to accelerate and improve NA degradation.

The ERA Tailings Technology Challenge provides the perfect, low-risk funding vehicle to validate this integrated solution at scale. Our proposed pilot is a systematic, staged project designed to leverage existing Alberta infrastructure (UofC, Innotech) and provide a cost-effective environment to tune the solution for your specific needs.

Could we schedule a brief technical discussion next week to review our scoped ERA project and explore how this partnership could benefit CNR?

Best regards,
