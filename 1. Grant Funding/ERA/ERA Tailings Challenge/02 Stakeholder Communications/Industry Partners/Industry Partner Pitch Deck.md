### **Industry Partner Pitch Deck: Modifications & Flow**

This deck will be 11 slides, incorporating your two new slides and modifying the existing ones.

---

**Slide 1: Title Slide**

- **Modification:** Change the tagline to be more collaborative.
    
- **New Tagline:** A Partnership Opportunity for the ERA Tailings Technology Challenge
    

**Slide 2: The Problem**

- **Modification:** No changes needed. This slide effectively frames the shared challenge.
    

**Slide 3: The Solution**

- **Modification:** No changes needed. This clearly explains your integrated platform.

### **Slide 4: The Direct ROI for Our Partners (NEW SLIDE)**

- **Placement:** Insert "The What You Get" slide here.
    
- **Reasoning:** After you've presented the problem and your solution, the immediate question from an operator is "What's in it for me?" This slide answers that question directly and powerfully, framing the rest of the deck as a clear value proposition for them.

**Slide 5: A Validated, Defensible Technology (Formerly "Why We Win")**

- **Modification:** Change the title from the competitive "Why We Win" to the more collaborative and factual "A Validated, Defensible Technology." The content of the slide remains perfect.
    

**Slide 6: The Scale of the Opportunity (Formerly "Market Opportunity")**

- **Modification:** Change the title from "Market Opportunity" to "The Scale of the Opportunity."
    
- **Content Tweak:** The content is already focused on the operators, which is great. Ensure the tone is about the scale of the _challenge_ they face, which your solution can address, rather than a "market" you plan to capture.
    

**Slide 7: The Team**

- **Modification:** No changes needed. A strong, credible team is crucial for any partnership.
    

**Slide 8: The Competitive Landscape**

- **Modification:** No changes needed. The "We Don't Compete; We Enhance" message is perfect for this audience and should be emphasized.
    

**Slide 9: Proven Traction & A De-Risked Roadmap**

- **Modification:** Change the title to add "De-Risked." This emphasizes the low-risk nature of your staged pilot plan, which is a key benefit for a corporate partner. The content remains the same.

### **Slide 10: The ERA Partnership Model (NEW SLIDE)**

- **Placement:** Insert "The Partnership Model" slide here.
    
- **Reasoning:** This is the core of your proposal to them. After you've shown the problem, your solution, the ROI, the validation, and the plan, you now present the clear, de-risked, and financially compelling partnership structure. It logically follows the roadmap.
**Headline: A Capital-Efficient Partnership to Solve the Tailings Challenge**

**Sub-headline:** We are seeking industry partners to join our **$8M** pilot project, submitted to the ERA Tailings Technology Challenge.
