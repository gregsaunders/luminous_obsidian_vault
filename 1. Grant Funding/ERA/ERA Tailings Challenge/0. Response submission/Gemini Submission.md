### **Executive Summary**

The Alberta oil sands industry faces an unprecedented challenge: for the first time in its history, the need to find a path to safely releasing Oil Sands tailing water into the environment. Unlike other mining operations with established water release protocols, oil sands operations have never had regulatory approval for discharge due to persistent naphthenic acid (NA) contamination that resists traditional breakdown methods.

The scale and urgency are immense: 1.4 trillion litres of stored tailings water, capacity constraints threatening expanded production, and government commitments creating an urgent need for breakthrough solutions. The bottleneck is not just treatment, it's the inability to monitor and manage NA reduction at the speed and scale required. While the Oil Sands Mine Water Steering Committee correctly identified HRMS as the accuracy standard, its cost ($500-$1000/test), complexity, and 2-4 week turnaround time make the frequent monitoring essential for process control practically and economically impossible. The industry faces a paradox: "If you can't measure it, you can't manage it," and current methods cannot measure at the required scale and frequency.

Luminous BioSolutions provides the missing piece: a field-validated biosensor technology (R² = 0.76 correlation with HRMS) that enables mass rapid testing in <24 hours at a fraction of the cost. Our integrated platform combines this revolutionary monitoring with targeted bioaugmentation. This project's "Contained-by-Design" validation approach eliminates environmental risk while generating the comprehensive performance data needed to establish our platform as the essential tool for enabling operational control of water treatment processes.

### **1. Technology Advancement**

**The Critical Problem: An Unprecedented Challenge in Oil Sands History**

Alberta's oil sands industry faces a unique environmental challenge never before encountered in the sector's history: the urgent need to safely release treated water into the environment. This situation is unprecedented because:

1. **No Historical Precedent for Water Release:** Unlike other Canadian mining operations (copper, gold) that have established regulatory frameworks for treated water discharge, oil sands operations have never had regulatory approval for water release. This creates a first-of-its-kind challenge requiring breakthrough solutions.
    
2. **The Naphthenic Acid Barrier:** The primary obstacle is persistent naphthenic acid (NA) contamination. Traditional remediation methods have proved to be insufficient NAs, which remain toxic in tailings water for decades.
    
3. **Scale and Urgency Crisis:** The problem has reached a critical scale with ~1.4 trillion litres of stored tailings requiring treatment and tailings facilities nearing capacity, creating urgent pressure for accelerated solutions.
    
4. **The Monitoring and Management Bottleneck:** The OSMWSC recommended standardized NA measurement. However, the HRMS standard, while accurate, presents barriers to the operational control required for this challenge. This challenge extends to the R&D process itself; traditional analytical chemistry is a major bottleneck, with studies showing success rates of less than 10% in identifying NA-degrading microbes from samples. This inefficiency has slowed the development of effective biological solutions for years:  
    
    - **Cost barrier** ($500-$1000/test) 
    
    - **Time barrier** (weeks for results)
    
    - **Scale barrier** (inability to perform mass testing). 
    
	The fundamental challenge remains: "If you can't measure it, you can't manage it."
    

**The Luminous Solution: Enabling Active Management at Unprecedented Scale**

The Luminous Integrated Platform provides the capability to address this challenge: mass rapid testing that enables active, data-driven management of water treatment processes. Our platform consists of three synergistic technologies:

1. **Rapid, Field-Validated Biosensor (TRL 5-6):** The core of our innovation is a peer-reviewed biosensor technology. Field validation at Imperial Oil's Kearl Engineered Wetland demonstrated a strong positive correlation (R² = 0.76) with the HRMS gold standard. This result confirms that our rapid, low-cost sensor reliably tracks actual NA content in complex OSPW samples. It provides:
    
    - **Rapid Results** - <24 hour results vs. 2-4 weeks for HRMS.
        
    - **Significant Lower Cost** - Projected 85%+ cost reduction per test.
        
    - **High-throughput capability** for mass rapid testing.
        
2. **Targeted Biological Remediation (TRL 4):** Building on Kearl Wetland findings that show declining removal rates in passive systems, our bioaugmentation serves as a vital "performance enhancement." We use our validated biosensor platform to rapidly screen thousands of native OSPW isolates. This proven method has already allowed us to identify dozens of potent strains and design **minimal, stable bacterial communities with enhanced NA degradation phenotypes**, ready for pilot-scale testing.
    
3. **Data-Driven Optimization Platform (TRL 5):** Our data platform integrates real-time biosensor data and any additional relevant sensor data with remediation activities, creating a knowledge graph that allows operators to move from passive waiting to active, optimized management of their water treatment processes.
    

**Technology Readiness and Advancement Plan**

- **Current State:** Biosensor: TRL 5-6 (field-validated, peer-reviewed); Bioaugmentation: TRL 4 (lab-characterized consortia).
    
- **Project Goal:** Advance the integrated platform to TRL 7-8 (system demonstration in a relevant environment).
    

### **2. Implementation & Readiness**

**Project Objectives and Scope**

The primary objective is to validate and optimize the integrated Luminous platform through a systematic scale-up pilot in controlled, contained mesocosm environments. The project's fundamental design principle is "Contained-by-Design", all validation activities occur within existing Alberta research infrastructure (University of Calgary, InnoTech Alberta) with zero potential for environmental contamination during the project term.

**Work Plan and Milestones**

This three to four year project follows a systematic scale-up approach:

- **Year 1: High-Throughput Screening:** Screen 1,000+ bacterial isolates to identify optimal NA-degrading consortia. This process builds on our successful preliminary work, where we have already used this methodology to identify and validate over 40 unique NA-degrading strains from an initial sample set.
    
- **Year 1 - 2: Controlled Mesocosm Optimization (U of C):** Conduct extensive bioaugmentation trials in greenhouse mesocosms, using the biosensor to provide rapid feedback. Grow Bacterial Strains in desktop bioreactors at UofC
    
- **Year 2 - 3: Large-Scale Outdoor Validation (InnoTech):** Scale up to large (5,000-15,000L) outdoor mesocosms under real-world conditions. Large Scale (1,000L) bacterial strains growth at InnoTech Fermentation Plant in Edmonton. Monitoring will include not only water chemistry via biosensors and HRMS, but also **16S rRNA gene sequencing** of the water and sediment. This will allow us to track the survival and persistence of our augmented consortia and confirm their safe integration into the native microbial ecosystem.
    
- **Year 3 - 4: Commercial Pathway Development:** Finalize performance analysis, prepare for regulatory submission, and formalize industry partnerships.

**Rationale for ERA Funding**

ERA funding is the critical catalyst to advance our validated components to an integrated commercial platform. This project represents a unique opportunity for ERA to fund not just a technology, but to validate a complete, capital-efficient platform that addresses monitoring, treatment, and optimization simultaneously. It is a strategic investment in a foundational technology that will unlock significant, long-term environmental and economic benefits for Alberta.

### **3. Environmental Performance**

**GHG Emissions Reductions**

This project's primary GHG benefit is the enablement of accelerated tailings pond reclamation, which directly eliminates a significant source of Alberta's industrial fugitive methane (CH₄) emissions. Oil sands tailings ponds are known sources of fugitive methane, with emissions estimated at 0.02–5.5 g CH₄/m²/day. By accelerating water treatment, our technology helps eliminate these methane sources sooner. Furthermore, our low-energy biological process avoids the significant GHG footprint of energy-intensive chemical treatment alternatives.

**Water, Air, and Land Benefits**

The platform provides direct toxicity reduction by accelerating NA degradation, enabling a pathway to safe water release. This enhances water recycling, reduces the need for freshwater withdrawals, and allows for faster land reclamation, returning vast areas to productive use years sooner.

### **4. Economic & Ancillary Benefits**

**Economic Impact & Competitiveness**

This project will create 10-15 high-quality FTE positions in Alberta. For operators, the technology fundamentally improves competitiveness:

- **Monitoring Cost Transformation:** An 85%+ reduction in monitoring expenses per sample compared to HRMS.
    
- **Operational Control:** A 10-20x increase in testing frequency, enabling unprecedented process optimization and risk management.
    
- **Liability Reduction:** Accelerated reclamation significantly decreases long-term financial obligations.
    

### **5. Stakeholder Engagement**

**Engagement Approach: Transparency Through Technology**

Our "Contained-by-Design" pilot, combined with the Luminous Data Hub, allows us to provide all stakeholders, regulators, industry, Indigenous and local communities with direct access to performance and safety data, building trust through evidence, not just promises.

**Regulatory and Policymaker Engagement**

This project directly supports OSMWSC Recommendation #5. We will provide regulators with comprehensive data on a technology that serves as the essential complement to HRMS, enabling the high-frequency monitoring required to effectively manage and regulate water treatment in the oil sands.

### **6. Commercialization & Market Fit**

**Target Market in Alberta**

The primary market is the major oil sands operators who manage over 300 km² of tailings ponds containing ~1.4 trillion litres of OSPW and are mandated to remediate them under AER Directive 085. This represents an estimated total addressable market of $15-20M annually in Alberta.

**Pathway to Commercialization**

Following successful project completion, our pathway includes securing commercial agreements, scaling sensor production, and deploying the integrated system in an operational constructed wetland, with subsequent expansion across the oil sands and into export markets.
