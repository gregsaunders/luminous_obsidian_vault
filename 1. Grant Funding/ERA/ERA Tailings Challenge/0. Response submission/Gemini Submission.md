### **Executive Summary**

The critical bottleneck to solving Alberta's 1.4 trillion litre tailings challenge isn't just treatment, it's **management**. While the industry has a "gold standard" for accuracy (HRMS), its high cost and 2-4 week turnaround time make the frequent monitoring required for active process control impossible. This creates a management paradox: operators cannot effectively manage what they cannot affordably and rapidly measure.

Luminous BioSolutions provides the key to unlock this paradox. Our platform's core is a field-validated biosensor that delivers actionable NA data in under 24 hours at a fraction of the cost of HRMS. Validation at Imperial Oil's Kearl Wetland confirmed our technology's credibility, demonstrating a strong correlation (R² = 0.76) with the HRMS standard on real OSPW samples. We provide the essential tool that complements HRMS, and enables a shift from passive containment to active, data-driven water management.

This project will scale our validated monitoring technology by integrating it with a targeted bioaugmentation solution in a risk-free, "Contained-by-Design" pilot. By leveraging existing Alberta research infrastructure, we will de-risk the complete platform and deliver a commercially-ready solution. This investment will provide Alberta's oil sands with the first viable, scalable toolset to finally manage and remediate one of its largest and most urgent environmental liabilities.

### **1. Technology Advancement**

**The Management Paradox: Alberta's Critical Tailings Bottleneck**

For decades, Alberta's oil sands have faced a unique challenge: the inability to safely release treated water due to persistent naphthenic acid (NA) contamination across ~1.4 trillion litres of tailings. The fundamental barrier to solving this isn't just treatment; it's the management paradox. The industry's "gold standard" for accuracy, HRMS, is a bottleneck, with high costs ($500-$1000/test) and 2-4 week turnaround times making the frequent monitoring required for active process control impossible.

This inefficiency extends to innovation itself, with traditional R&D methods showing success rates of less than 10% in identifying NA-degrading microbes. The industry cannot effectively manage, or improve, what it cannot affordably and rapidly measure.

**The Luminous Solution: A De-Risked Platform for Active Management**

The Luminous Integrated Platform breaks this impasse. Our solution is a synergistic toolkit designed to enable active, data-driven management of water treatment for the first time.

- **Pillar 1: Field-Validated Monitoring (TRL 5-6).** The platform's core is our peer-reviewed biosensor technology. Field validation at Imperial Oil's Kearl Wetland confirmed its credibility, demonstrating a strong positive correlation **(R² = 0.76)** with the HRMS standard on real OSPW samples. This technology delivers actionable data in **<24 hours at a projected 85%+ cost reduction**, unlocking the high-throughput capability essential for operational control. 

- **Pillar 2: Targeted Bioremediation (TRL 4).** Building on the Kearl Wetland finding that passive systems have declining performance, our bioaugmentation acts as a vital "performance enhancement." Using our validated biosensor, we have already developed a proven methodology to rapidly screen and identify dozens of potent bacterial strains that are **naturally occurring and native to the oil sands tailings environment**. We use these indigenous microbes to design **minimal, stable bacterial communities with enhanced NA degradation phenotypes**, creating a powerful and environmentally safe solution ready for pilot-scale deployment.
    
- **Pillar 3: Data-Driven Optimization (TRL 5).** Our data platform integrates all monitoring data to create a knowledge graph, allowing operators to optimize their treatment processes with predictive insights.
    

**A De-Risked Investment at the Ideal Stage for ERA**

This project is perfectly positioned for ERA funding. We are not proposing to invent a technology, but to **integrate and scale validated components.** The biosensor is field-proven, and the methodology for developing the bioaugmentation solution is already de-risked. This project will advance the integrated platform from **TRL 4-6 to TRL 7-8**, bridging the exact commercialization gap that ERA targets. We have a credible, low-risk plan to deliver a commercially-ready platform that addresses one of Alberta's most significant environmental and economic challenges.

### **2. Implementation & Readiness**

**Project Objectives and Scope**

The primary objective is to validate and optimize the integrated Luminous platform through a systematic scale-up pilot in controlled, contained mesocosm environments. The project's fundamental design principle is "Contained-by-Design", all validation activities occur within existing Alberta research infrastructure (University of Calgary, InnoTech Alberta) with zero potential for environmental contamination during the project term.

**Work Plan and Milestones**

This three to four year project follows a systematic scale-up approach:

- **Year 1: High-Throughput Screening:** Screen 1,000+ bacterial isolates to identify optimal NA-degrading consortia. This process builds on our successful preliminary work, where we have already used this methodology to identify and validate over 40 unique NA-degrading strains from an initial sample set.
    
- **Year 1 - 2: Controlled Mesocosm Optimization (U of C):** Conduct extensive bioaugmentation trials in greenhouse mesocosms, using the biosensor to provide rapid feedback. Grow Bacterial Strains in desktop bioreactors at UofC
    
- **Year 2 - 3: Large-Scale Outdoor Validation (InnoTech):** Scale up to large (5,000-15,000L) outdoor mesocosms under real-world conditions. Large Scale (1,000L) bacterial strains growth at InnoTech Fermentation Plant in Edmonton. Monitoring will include not only water chemistry via biosensors and HRMS, but also **16S rRNA gene sequencing** of the water and sediment. This will allow us to track the survival and persistence of our augmented consortia and confirm their safe integration into the native microbial ecosystem.
    
- **Year 3 - 4: Commercial Pathway Development:** Finalize performance analysis, prepare for regulatory submission, and formalize industry partnerships.

**Rationale for ERA Funding**

ERA funding is the critical catalyst to advance our validated components to an integrated commercial platform. This project represents a unique opportunity for ERA to fund not just a technology, but to validate a complete, capital-efficient platform that addresses monitoring, treatment, and optimization simultaneously. It is a strategic investment in a foundational technology that will unlock significant, long-term environmental and economic benefits for Alberta.

### **3. Environmental Performance**

**GHG Emissions Reductions**

This project's primary GHG benefit is the enablement of accelerated tailings pond reclamation, which directly eliminates a significant source of Alberta's industrial fugitive methane (CH₄) emissions. Oil sands tailings ponds are known sources of fugitive methane, with emissions estimated at 0.02–5.5 g CH₄/m²/day. By accelerating water treatment, our technology helps eliminate these methane sources sooner. Furthermore, our low-energy biological process avoids the significant GHG footprint of energy-intensive chemical treatment alternatives.

**Water, Air, and Land Benefits**

The platform provides direct toxicity reduction by accelerating NA degradation, enabling a pathway to safe water release. This enhances water recycling, reduces the need for freshwater withdrawals, and allows for faster land reclamation, returning vast areas to productive use years sooner.

### **4. Economic & Ancillary Benefits**

**Economic Impact & Competitiveness**

This project will create 10-15 high-quality FTE positions in Alberta. For operators, the technology fundamentally improves competitiveness:

- **Monitoring Cost Transformation:** An 85%+ reduction in monitoring expenses per sample compared to HRMS.
    
- **Operational Control:** A 10-20x increase in testing frequency, enabling unprecedented process optimization and risk management.
    
- **Liability Reduction:** Accelerated reclamation significantly decreases long-term financial obligations.
    

### **5. Stakeholder Engagement**

**Engagement Approach: Transparency Through Technology**

Our "Contained-by-Design" pilot, combined with the Luminous Data Hub, allows us to provide all stakeholders, regulators, industry, Indigenous and local communities with direct access to performance and safety data, building trust through evidence, not just promises.

**Regulatory and Policymaker Engagement**

This project directly supports OSMWSC Recommendation #5. We will provide regulators with comprehensive data on a technology that serves as the essential complement to HRMS, enabling the high-frequency monitoring required to effectively manage and regulate water treatment in the oil sands.

### **6. Commercialization & Market Fit**

**Target Market in Alberta**

The primary market is the major oil sands operators who manage over 300 km² of tailings ponds containing ~1.4 trillion litres of OSPW and are mandated to remediate them under AER Directive 085. This represents an estimated total addressable market of $15-20M annually in Alberta.

**Pathway to Commercialization**

Following successful project completion, our pathway includes securing commercial agreements, scaling sensor production, and deploying the integrated system in an operational constructed wetland, with subsequent expansion across the oil sands and into export markets.
