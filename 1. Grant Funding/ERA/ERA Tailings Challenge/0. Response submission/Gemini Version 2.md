### **Executive Summary**

The critical bottleneck to solving Alberta's 1.4 trillion litre tailings challenge isn't just treatment—it's **management**. While the industry has a "gold standard" for accuracy (HRMS), its high cost and 2-4 week turnaround time make the frequent monitoring required for active process control impossible. This creates a management paradox: operators cannot effectively manage what they cannot affordably and rapidly measure.

Luminous BioSolutions provides the key to unlock this paradox. Our platform's core is a field-validated biosensor that delivers actionable NA data in under 24 hours at a fraction of the cost of HRMS. Validation at Imperial Oil's Kearl Wetland confirmed our technology's credibility, demonstrating a strong correlation **(R² = 0.76)** with the HRMS standard on real OSPW samples. We provide the essential tool that **complements** HRMS, enabling a shift from passive containment to **active, data-driven water management.**

This **$8M project**, ==supported by a committed industry partner,== will scale our validated monitoring technology by integrating it with a targeted bioaugmentation solution in a risk-free, **"Contained-by-Design"** pilot. By leveraging existing Alberta research infrastructure, we will de-risk the complete platform and deliver a commercially-ready system. This investment will provide Alberta's oil sands with the first viable, scalable toolset to finally manage and remediate one of its largest and most urgent environmental liabilities.

### **2. Implementation & Readiness**

**Project Objectives and Scope**

The primary objective is to validate and optimize the integrated Luminous platform through a systematic scale-up pilot in controlled, contained mesocosm environments. The project's fundamental design principle is **"Contained-by-Design"**; all validation activities occur within existing Alberta research infrastructure (University of Calgary, InnoTech Alberta) with zero potential for environmental contamination during the project term.

**Consortium and Execution Structure**

This project is a powerful collaboration between a technology innovator, world-class research institutions, and a **committed industry leader**.

- **Lead Applicant:** Luminous BioSolutions Inc. 
    
- **Industry Partner (Committed):** A leading Canadian oil sands operator will act as the project's primary industrial partner, providing **committed co-funding**, OSPW samples, and a technical advisory committee.
    
- **Infrastructure Partners (Confirmed):** University of Calgary and InnoTech Alberta.
    

**Work Plan and Milestones**

This **48-month project** follows an efficient, integrated, and overlapping four-phase plan designed to maximize scientific rigor and accelerate outcomes.

- **Phase 1: Project Initiation & High-Throughput Screening (Months 1-12)**
    
    - **Objective:** Prepare all project components and identify the most potent bacterial consortia for bioaugmentation trials. This phase builds on our successful preliminary work, where we have already used this methodology to identify and validate over 40 unique NA-degrading strains.
        
    - **Key Deliverable:** A ranked portfolio of the top 10 validated NA-degrading consortia and fully commissioned greenhouse mesocosm systems at the University of Calgary.
        
- **Phase 2: Integrated Validation at Greenhouse Scale (Months 10-24)**
    
    - **Objective:** To simultaneously validate the biosensor platform's commercial-grade performance (TRL 5 → 7) _using_ the dynamic environment of the bioaugmentation trials conducted in the **U of C greenhouse mesocosms**. This integrated approach ensures the biosensor is tested under realistic, actively managed remediation conditions.
        
    - **Key Deliverable:** A comprehensive "Greenhouse Validation Report" detailing both the biosensor's performance against all KPIs and the efficacy of the top bioaugmentation consortia at a small scale.
        
- **Phase 3: At-Scale Validation in Outdoor Mesocosms (Months 25-36)**
    
    - **Objective:** To validate the entire integrated process (monitoring + bioaugmentation) at a larger scale under real-world environmental conditions at the **InnoTech Alberta** facility.
        
    - **Key Deliverable:** A "Scale-Up Performance Report" from the InnoTech trials, providing the final, regulatory-grade dataset needed for commercial planning.
        
- **Phase 4: Commercial Pathway Development (Months 37-48)**
    
    - **Objective:** To translate the full pilot success into a shovel-ready commercial project.
        
    - **Key Deliverable:** A detailed engineering plan and a finalized commercial agreement for the first on-site deployment at our industry partner's operational facility.
        

**Budget and Financing**

The project is strongly supported by a consortium of funders, led by a committed industry partner, which substantially de-risks the project's financial plan.
