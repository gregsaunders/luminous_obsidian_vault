# Platform Framework

This framework provides an integrated approach for organizations to navigate complexity and adapt effectively. It synthesizes established methodologies â€“ using Cynefin for sense-making, Estuarine Mapping for strategic prioritization, Theory of Constraints for identifying key bottlenecks, and Lean/Agile with OODA loops for responsive execution.

Core principles like systems thinking, continuous learning, and pragmatic experimentation ensure actions are context-aware and focused. The framework is designed to be amplified by an intelligent data platform that uses graph structures and AI to provide enhanced situational awareness, deeper insights, and accelerated learning.
