Subject: Request for Discussion - Industrial Transformation Challenge 2025 Submission

Dear ERA Applications Team,

I'm Jeff Violo, Co-founder of Luminous BioSolutions. We are a new Alberta-based environmental technology company preparing a submission for the Industrial Transformation Challenge 2025. We've developed an integrated solution for monitoring and remediating naphthenic acids (NAs) in oil sands tailings ponds and our solutions seems to show a strong alignment with ERA's objectives.

I'd like to request a brief Teams meeting to ensure our approach aligns with ERA's expectations and to gain clarity on a few key aspects of the submission process. Specifically, I'd like to discuss:

1. Provide a brief overview of our solution (biosensor detection, data platform, and bioaugmentation) and confirm its eligibility under the "Environmental remediation and sustainability" category
    
2. Discuss appropriate methodologies for quantifying indirect GHG benefits from our water treatment technology, as this is a critical evaluation criteria
    
3. Understand the requirements for partnership documentation at the EOI stage, as we're actively pursuing agreements with oil sands operators and Indigenous communities that may not all be formalized by the June 12 deadline
    
4. Get insights on ERA's expectations for Indigenous engagement documentation and structure
    
A 30 minute conversation would assist us in developing a submission that addresses ERA's priorities and evaluation criteria. We will be flexible with timing and availability over the next week as this is an important program for us.

Our solution addresses a persistent environmental challenge for Alberta's oil sands, and the solutions will be a "first of kind implementation".  A brief discussion would be valuable for both parties to ensure the submission meets ERA's needs while accurately representing our technology's potential.

Thank you for considering this request. I look forward to your response.

Best regards,

Jeff Violo Co-founder, Luminous BioSolutions 403-813-8529 jeff.violo@luminousbiosolutions.com
