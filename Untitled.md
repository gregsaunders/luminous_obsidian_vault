We cannot afford to wait, the cost of inaction - both financial and reputational - is too high. 

Our biosensors, remediation technologies and data analytics are a new, innovative, practical, cost-effective, and scalable solution to address the NA challenge in tailings ponds.

By adopting our strategies, oil sands operators can improve environmental performance, rebuild public trust, and accelerate responsible reclamation efforts.

We invite oil sands operators, regulators, and Indigenous, local communities’ environmental stakeholders to collaborate with us in deploying this solution.
