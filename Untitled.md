Current NA monitoring methods (i.e.. Mass Spectrometry) are accurate but suffer from high costs, slow turnaround times, and limited sampling frequency. This results in low-resolution data, leaving industry and regulators blind to real-time changes.

#### With Luminous biosensors, Oil Sands operators can:

- **Increase testing frequency** across more locations throughout the water cycle, providing a **higher-resolution map** of NA concentrations.
- **Track changes in near real-time**, allowing for proactive management rather than reactive mitigation.
- **Reduce environmental risk** due to confident and comprehensive NA monitoring data.

For **regulators and local communities**, this means **greater transparency and trust** with clear, consistent data that ensures environmental safety.
