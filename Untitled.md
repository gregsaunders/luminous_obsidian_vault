Without an accurate baseline of NA concentration in the tailings ponds and a method to track progress, making informed decisions is impossible.Â  We are developing an **NA monitoring and analytics platform** that compiles NA test results in a **data hub** to provide:

- **Real-time tracking of NA levels** across multiple sites and throughout the water cycle.
- **AI-powered trend analysis** to predict problem areas before they escalate.
- **Regulatory compliance support**, ensuring all monitoring data is easily accessible for audits and public transparency.

Combining **biosensor screening with remediation and data analytics**, operators, regulators, and stakeholders are empowered with actionable intelligence for better environmental management.
