I have developed research programs in microbiology, antibiotic discovery and in bacterial biosensors for diverse applications. We use synthetic biology to engineer bacterial biosensors that detect naphthenic acids, the primary chemicals of concern in oil sands tailings ponds. These NA biosensors are being commercialized as novel tools for environmental monitoring of NA in water, and they also facilitate identifying microbes that degrade naphthenic acids. Our goal is to identify minimal bacterial communities that can efficiently degrade naphthenic acids in water treatment strategies.

Our Purpose 

Everything we do is driven by a clear purpose: to solve a complex environmental challenge through innovation. We're committed to creating solutions that help address the NA problem in Oil Sands Tailings Ponds. 

We hold ourselves to a high standard with core values that guide our work:

- **Transparency:** We share our process and data openly, building trust with partners and communities.
- **Sustainability:** We prioritize environmental responsibility, ensuring our work benefits the environment.
- **Collaboration:** We believe in the power of working together and welcome diverse perspectives to strengthen our solutions.

We’re not just building a product; we’re building relationships and a brighter future.
