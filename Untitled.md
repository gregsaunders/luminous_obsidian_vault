Luminous BioSolutions is a new Canadian Environmental Technology Company who has developed an innovative approach to detecting and breaking down Naphthenic Acids.

Our bioluminescent bacterial biosensors provide a **fast, cost-effective, and highly scalable** method for monitoring NA levels and offering real-time insights that existing techniques cannot match.

#### How It Works

- **Rapid Detection:** Our engineered bacteria emit light in the presence of NAs, providing an immediate, easy-to-read signal of contamination.
- **High Sensitivity:** Detects even low concentrations of NAs, making it an ideal early-warning system.

**Scalable & Cost-Effective:** Unlike expensive lab tests that require weeks of processing, our biosensors allow high-throughput screening at **a fraction of the cost**.
