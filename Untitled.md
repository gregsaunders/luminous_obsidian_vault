Two months ago, the Alberta government committed to creating new rules for oil sands water release, tackling a $130 billion environmental liability. However, their own expert panel identified the critical bottleneck, The standard methods for measuring the key contaminant naphthenic acids (NA), are too slow and expensive for anyone to actually manage the problem.

Operators are trapped in a management paradox: they're being told to solve a problem that is practically impossible to measure at scale. We provide the key to unlock that paradox. Our platform is centered on a proprietary biosensor that delivers specific and accurate naphthenic acid results in under 24 hours for less than $100 a test, compared to the weeks and thousands of dollars for the current standard. Current testing methods also require expensive complex equipment that require graduate level operators performing the tests. Based on the increased testing volume, we do not have enough equipment or qualified people to meet the demand. Our testing can be performed by a technician and the equipment is simple to operate and we can easily perform thousands of tests per day, eliminating the bottleneck. 

This isn't just a lab concept. Our science is peer-reviewed, and we've been de-risked with over $500,000 in backing from industry leaders like CNRL. Most importantly, our technology was recently field-validated at Imperial's Kearl wetland pilot, where we demonstrated a strong correlation (R² = 0.76) with the very HRMS standard the government is recommending.

We're not trying to replace the multi-million dollar labs; we're making them viable. We enable a two-tiered approach: our rapid, low-cost screening for daily operational management, and their high-cost analysis for final validation. We're not selling a science project; we're selling operational control and regulatory certainty.

We are raising $1.5 million to scale our production and deploy our first commercial systems. This capital will get us to our first $1M in annual recurring revenue within 24 months.

The government has created a mandatory, multi-million dollar market for monitoring right here in Alberta. We are the only company with a validated, scalable technology ready to meet that demand."
