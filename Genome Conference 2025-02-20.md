3. **Carolina Berdugo** - Imperial  COSIA 
	https://www.linkedin.com/in/carolina-berdugo-clavijo-80306353/
	At my current job I look for opportunities to improve industry's environmental performance, supporting and developing research programs related to water treatment, land reclamation and restoration and environmental monitoring, and by establishing collaborations with researchers in academia, government and private sectors to answer industry's knowledge gaps and support environmental compliance of the industry.  
  
	Other experiences include: eDNA, data analysis, microbiology, methanogenesis, environmental education, and bioremediation.

4. **Lisa Gieg** - UofC

	 Environmental Microbiology, Petroleum Microbiology, Anaerobic Hydrocarbon Metabolism, Biodegradation, Bioremediation, Enhanced Energy Recovery, Sulfate Reduction, Methanogenesis

	In the Gieg laboratory, we aim to understand how anaerobic microorganisms metabolize a variety of compounds associated with the energy industry (mainly hydrocarbons) that have either been accidentally released into the environment or are present in natural reservoirs.  Recent studies have shown that anaerobic microorganisms use metabolic strategies distinct from those of aerobes in order to biodegrade hydrocarbons, such as activation by fumarate addition, carboxylation, hydroxylation, and methylation.  Overall, anaerobic hydrocarbon metabolism is poorly understood.  

	Using combined tools of cultivation, analytical chemistry, and molecular biology, we seek to: 

	1. elucidate novel anaerobic biodegradation pathways of different classes of hydrocarbons and related compounds under highly reduced conditions (e.g., sulfate-reducing and methanogenic conditions)  
	2. understand the associated biochemical and enzymatic mechanisms 
	3. identify and isolate key consortia and species involved 
	4. investigate the ecological constraints on anaerobic hydrocarbon metabolism

	In determining the fundamental science underlying anaerobic hydrocarbon biodegradation, we can begin to formulate universal themes of metabolism and apply what we learn to important environmental problems or energy-related systems such as:

	- Anaerobic bioremediation at fuel-contaminated sites
	- Enhanced energy recovery via the bioconversion of oil to methane in marginal oilfields
	- Biocorrosion
	- Paraffin biotreatment or prevention
	- Heavy oil formation and recovery via microbial activity
	- Oil sands tailings ponds reclamation
	- Oil and gas souring

5. **Gabrielle Scheffer** - Genome Alberta
	https://www.linkedin.com/in/gabrielle-scheffer-msc-phd-38105b120/
	gscheffer@genomealberta.ca
	Gabrielle is an ambitious and energetic individual. She obtained her BSc in Molecular Microbiology from the University of Sherbrooke and her MSc and PhD in Environmental Microbiology and Geomicrobiology from the University of Calgary. Prior to joining Genome Alberta, she started her own business to apply genomics in the energy sector and drive innovation in the province. Outside of work, Gabrielle enjoys hiking in the beautiful Rockies and spending time with her pets and a good book.

6. **Gijs va Rooijen** - Genome Alberta
	https://www.linkedin.com/in/gijs-van-rooijen/
	vanrooijen@genomealberta.ca
	Gijs obtained a Ph.D. degree from the University of Calgary in 1993 and in 2006 he became the inaugural Chief Scientific Officer for Genome Alberta. He is an inventor on several U.S. patents and currently serves on several science advisory boards. In September 2017, he was elected to the University of Calgary Senate and is engaged in several volunteer activities, including mentoring students that are considering a career in science. In his spare time, he enjoys hiking and traveling across Europe.

7. **Beth Richardson** - MRU
	https://www.mtroyal.ca/ProgramsCourses/FacultiesSchoolsCentres/ScienceTechnology/Departments/Biology/Faculty/Beth-Richardson.htm

	Beth Richardson is a microbial ecologist and environmental DNA specialist, who uses DNA extracted from soil, sediment and water to examine the microbiome of her study sites. Most of her work focuses on landscapes undergoing reclamation in the Athabasca Oil Sands Region, though she has also worked on samples from environments as diverse as sea ice in the Arctic,the sunlit ocean, and municipal recreation sites. Though her work has applications in public and environmental health, her favourite aspect of her research is studying the evolution of microbes in the ecological niche they have chosen to call home. By examining the biology of single-celled organisms in complex and often challenging environments, Beth aims to discover the genomic adaptations that allow them to survive and thrive, and how these traits are shared across other microbes in the same community.

	She did postdoctoral work at the University of Alberta in the School of Public Health, continuing her research on microbial communities in the Athabasca Oil Sands. She began her current position as an Assistant Professor in Cell Biology and Genetics at Mount Royal University in 2022.

8. **Lisa Stein** - UofA
	https://www.linkedin.com/in/lisa-y-stein-b4b06613/
	Our research team between the faculties of Science and Engineering are building genome-scale metabolic models for methane-consuming microorganisms and N-cycle lithotrophs. These models will enable us to generate better genome annotations, predict metabolic fluxes, and develop novel hypotheses regarding microbial regulation of biogeochemical cycles. Our primary goal is to integrate evolutionary, functional, and regulatory information of genes/enzymes involved in nitrogen, carbon, and other biogeochemical cycles to inform studies on natural and engineered ecosystems and to gate carbon into value-added products. This work is particularly important for deciphering meta'omic data that relies on proper database annotation and true-to-life context of gene/enzyme functions.  
  
	Specialties: microbial physiology; molecular biology; functional genomics; nitrogen cycle; nitrogen oxide metabolism; methanotrophy; single-carbon metabolism; methane bioconversion
