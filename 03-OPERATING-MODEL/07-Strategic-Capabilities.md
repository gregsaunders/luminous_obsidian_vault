## Strategic Capability 1: Science Leadership

**Owner:** Dr. Shawn Lewenza, PhD Microbiologist

### Core Expertise
| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Scientific Foundation** | PhD Microbiologist with deep expertise in biosensor biochemistry and bacterial detection systems |
| **Research Leadership** | Led development of the 3-panel biosensor system for NA detection |
| **Industry Credibility** | Recognized expertise in oil sands remediation and water quality monitoring |

### Team Asset: Tyson Bookout
- **Lead author** of the biosensor publication (Bookout et al. 2024, ACS Synthetic Biology)
- Serving as **Lab Technician** - direct continuity from R&D to operations
- Deep understanding of assay protocols, edge cases, and optimization

### Intellectual Property Position
| IP Type | Description | Defensibility |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| **Biosensor Panel** | Three-probe system (atuA-L, marR-L, p3680-lux) | Published science = credibility; operational know-how = moat |
| **Assay Protocol** | 15-hour bioluminescence protocol with 45 time points | Optimized through extensive validation |
| **Scientific Insight** | Bioavailable fraction measurement (not total NAs) | Unique positioning validated by HRMS specialists |

### Scientific Network
- University of Calgary research connections
- NAIT collaboration opportunities
- InnoTech Alberta relationships

## Strategic Capability 2: Technology & Data Platform

**Owner:** Greg Saunders, Platform Lead

### Core Expertise
| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Architecture Vision** | Relational Context Engine designed for multivariate correlation at scale |
| **Data Engineering** | Experience building data platforms that handle complex, interconnected datasets |
| **AI/ML Foundation** | Platform architecture ready for future predictive capabilities |

### Platform Technical Advantages
| Capability | Description | Why It Matters |
|------------|-------------|----------------|
| **Multivariate Correlation** | Links biosensor results + SCADA data + weather + dosing logs | No manual cross-referencing; patterns emerge automatically |
| **Immutable Audit Trail** | TerminusDB-based data lineage | Regulatory trust; proves data hasn't been altered |
| **Contextual Intelligence** | Ingests historical research (PDFs, reports) to inform current decisions | Institutional memory that compounds over time |

### Data Moat Thesis
```
Today: Each sample processed builds the correlation dataset
       ↓
Year 1: Patterns emerge across customers (anonymized)
       ↓
Year 2+: Predictive models trained on industry-wide patterns
       ↓
Result: First-mover advantage in NA monitoring intelligence
```

The data moat grows with every sample. Competitors starting later will have less training data and weaker pattern recognition.

### Technology Readiness
| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Data Ingestion Pipeline | Ready | API-based upload from lab |
| Correlation Engine | Ready | Core platform capability |
| Customer Dashboard | In Development | Pilot-ready version targeted |
| Alerting System | Ready | Threshold-based notifications |
| Reporting Templates | In Development | AER, Indigenous community formats |

**Investor Framing:**
> "We're not building a dashboard; we're building the data infrastructure for an industry that doesn't have one yet. Every sample makes the platform smarter."

| **Trust Currency** | Years of relationship building in the industry | Operators buy from people they trust |

### Go-to-Market Speed
- Pilot conversations initiated through existing networks
- Understanding of budget cycles and procurement timelines
- Knowledge of internal champions and skeptics at key accounts

### Stakeholder Navigation
| Stakeholder | Our Understanding | Capability |
|-------------|-------------------|------------|
| **Operators** | Pain points, ROI requirements, risk tolerance | Sell the $260k efficiency win |
| **Regulators (AER)** | Compliance requirements, approval pathways | Position for regulatory acceptance |
| **Indigenous Communities** | Transparency needs, reporting preferences | Build trust through accessible data |

**Investor Framing:**
> "We know the buyers, the buying process, and the political landscape. This industry moves on trust, and we have it."
