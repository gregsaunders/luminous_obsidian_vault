## Purpose

This document defines **what the customer actually receives** from a Luminous pilot. The output isn't just "monitoring data" - it's **operational intelligence that drives decisions they couldn't make before**.

---

## The Core Insight: We Measure What Matters

### Why Our Biosensor Data Is Different

Traditional HRMS measures **total naphthenic acids** - everything in the sample. But total NAs are a poor proxy for what operators actually care about: **toxicity**.

**The science:**
- Toxicity degrades rapidly in wetlands
- The **most hydrophobic NAs are most toxic** - and they degrade first
- HRMS can't distinguish between toxic and degraded fractions

**What our biosensor measures:**
- **Bioavailable compounds** - what microbes can actually interact with
- **Hydrophobic fraction** - the compounds that correlate with toxicity
- Not "total NAs" but the **biologically relevant fraction**

> **"We don't just measure NAs. We measure the NAs that matter."**

This has been validated by HRMS specialists at the NA Workshop (July 2025) and aligns with Environment Canada's tiered monitoring recommendations.

## The Value Proposition (Summary)

> **"We don't just give you data. We give you the feedback loops to make decisions you couldn't make before."**

| What They Have Today | What Luminous Provides |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| 4 data points/year (HRMS) | 100+ data points/month (Biosensor) |
| Feedback in 4 weeks | Feedback in 24-72 hours |
| Manual correlation (Excel) | Automated correlation (Context Engine) |
| Calendar-based decisions | Evidence-based decisions |
| "Trust us" to regulators | "Here's the proof" (Glass Box) |

## The Real Deliverable: Operational Intelligence Discovery

### What We're NOT Selling

- ❌ A fixed set of 5 reports
- ❌ A dashboard with pre-defined metrics
- ❌ Confirmation of what they already know

### What We ARE Selling

- ✅ **All operational insights** enabled by unprecedented data density
- ✅ **Discovery of unknowns** - patterns they didn't know to look for
- ✅ **Data-driven decisions** that were previously impossible
- ✅ **Speed of learning** - compress 5 years of pilots into 18 months

### The Discovery Opportunity

With 100+ data points per month (vs. 4 per year), **we don't know everything the pilot will reveal**. That's the point.

**What we know for certain:**
- We will see patterns invisible to quarterly sampling
- We will correlate biosensor response to environmental variables in real-time
- We will identify optimizations specific to their system

**What we might discover:**
- Spatial performance variations no one suspected
- Seasonal windows more nuanced than temperature alone
- Recovery dynamics unique to their wetland design
- Correlation with variables they weren't tracking
- Anomalies that trigger investigation (and prevent costly mistakes)

> **"The pilot isn't just validation. It's exploration. We're turning on headlights in the dark."**

## Five Validated Scenarios (Examples, Not Limits)

The following scenarios were validated in the Kearl Wetland Study. They represent **proven value**, not the complete set of possibilities. A pilot with higher-frequency sampling across more locations may reveal insights we can't anticipate today.

These are the **specific decisions** a customer can make with Luminous that they cannot make without it.

---

### Scenario 1: Seasonal Operating Strategy

**Annual Value:** $104,000

#### The Blind Spot (Without Luminous)
- Operators shut down wetlands by **calendar date** (e.g., September 15)
- Why? Because HRMS lab results take 4+ weeks - they can't confirm biological activity is still occurring
- Result: Lost treatment capacity at the end of every season

#### What Luminous Delivers
- **Daily biosensor readings** show biological activity in real-time
- **Temperature correlation** proves treatment continues until ~5°C threshold
- **Evidence package** for regulators showing extended window is safe

#### The Decision Enabled
> "We can operate 3 weeks longer because we can **see** treatment is still working."

#### Pilot Deliverable
- **Seasonal Optimization Report**: Temperature vs. treatment effectiveness curve, recommended shutdown threshold, regulatory evidence package

---

### Scenario 2: Spatial Optimization

**Annual Value:** $78,000

#### The Blind Spot (Without Luminous)
- Operators treat the entire wetland as a "black box"
- All cells get equal flow regardless of performance
- No visibility into which areas are doing the heavy lifting

#### What Luminous Delivers
- **Cell-by-cell performance data** showing treatment rates by location
- **Kearl finding**: Shallow vegetated cells outperform deep pools by 18%
- **Flow routing recommendations** based on actual performance

#### The Decision Enabled
> "Route 60% more flow to shallow cells. **Increase capacity 26% without building new infrastructure.**"

#### Pilot Deliverable
- **Spatial Performance Map**: Cell-by-cell treatment rates, depth vs. performance correlation, flow optimization recommendations

---

### Scenario 3: Toxicity-Targeted Validation

**Annual Value:** $36,000

#### The Blind Spot (Without Luminous)
- "Total NAs" is a poor proxy for actual toxicity
- Operators pay $8,000 per Microtox bioassay to confirm toxicity reduction
- Assays are slow (weeks) and infrequent

#### What Luminous Delivers
- **Biosensor Panel 2 (marR-L)** correlates R² = 0.89 with toxic O₂-NAFC fraction
- **Daily leading indicator** of toxicity, not monthly lagging confirmation
- **Validated correlation** between biosensor response and HRMS chemistry

#### The Decision Enabled
> "Our biosensor shows toxicity is dropping. We can **reduce expensive bio-assays by 75%**."

#### Pilot Deliverable
- **Toxicity Correlation Report**: Biosensor vs. Microtox correlation, recommended assay reduction strategy, cost savings analysis

---

### Scenario 4: Refill Impact Management

**Annual Value:** $14,000

#### The Blind Spot (Without Luminous)
- When OSPW is added to top up the wetland, operators pause outflow for 14 days "just to be safe"
- Why? They can't see how quickly the system recovers
- Result: Lost capacity during every refill event

#### What Luminous Delivers
- **Continuous monitoring** before, during, and after refill
- **Kearl finding**: Recovery happens in 7 days, not 14
- **Threshold-based restart** instead of calendar-based

#### The Decision Enabled
> "We can resume outflow 7 days earlier. **That's 7 extra days of treatment capacity per refill event.**"

#### Pilot Deliverable
- **Refill Recovery Analysis**: Time-to-recovery curves, recommended restart thresholds, capacity recapture estimate

---

### Scenario 5: Automated Regulatory Reporting

**Annual Value:** $24,000

#### The Blind Spot (Without Luminous)
- Data is trapped in spreadsheets across multiple systems
- Regulatory reporting is a manual, time-consuming project
- Auditors question data integrity ("Was this manipulated?")

#### What Luminous Delivers
- **Immutable audit trail** (TerminusDB) - data cannot be altered
- **Automated correlation** of all data sources (biosensor, LIMS, weather, flow)
- **Regulator-ready exports** with complete chain of custody

#### The Decision Enabled
> "When regulators ask for proof, we hand them a **digital key to an immutable record**, not a PDF."

#### Pilot Deliverable
- **Regulatory Readiness Package**: Complete audit trail, data lineage documentation, view-only regulator access (optional)

## The "Multivariate Correlation" Value

### Why Can't They Just Use Excel?

The Kearl study revealed treatment rates dropped **53% mid-season** (0.53 → 0.25 mg/L/day).

| Response | Without Luminous | With Luminous |
|----------|-----------------|---------------|
| **Detection** | 4 weeks later (next HRMS) | 24-72 hours |
| **Root Cause** | Guess: Add nutrients? ($12k) | System correlates to temperature shift (normal) |
| **Decision** | Panic intervention | "Do nothing" (saved $12k) |

### The Correlation Challenge

A single biosensor reading is **meaningless without context**. The platform answers:

1. **What changed?** (the reading)
2. **Why did it change?** (temperature? flow? season? refill?)
3. **Has this happened before?** (historical pattern match)
4. **Is this normal?** (threshold vs. anomaly)
5. **What should we do?** (recommended action)

## Why Industry Needs This (NA Workshop Validation)

The July 2025 NA Workshop (hosted by NAIT, attended by ECCC, Government of Alberta, InnoTech, university researchers, and commercial labs) identified critical needs that align with Luminous:

| Industry Need | Current Pain | Luminous Solution |
|---------------|--------------|-------------------|
| **High-throughput screening** | HRMS can't process thousands of samples | Biosensor designed for scale |
| **Tiered monitoring approach** | All samples get expensive analysis | Fast screen + targeted deep-dive |
| **Standardization** | Mass Spec has poor inter-lab consistency | Biosensor is reproducible, simpler |
| **Faster feedback** | 4+ week turnaround from HRMS labs | 24-72 hour turnaround |
| **Toxicity indicator** | Total NAs ≠ toxicity | Biosensor measures bioavailable fraction |

> **Workshop consensus:** "Use simple, fast methods for routine detection and advanced techniques for anomalies."

That's exactly what we enable.

## Pricing Implications

The $260k annual value is based on a **mature, multi-water-body operation**.

For a 1-2 water body pilot, realistic scenario validation:
- Scenario 1 (Seasonal): **Likely achievable** (if pilot spans season end)
- Scenario 2 (Spatial): **Achievable if multiple cells sampled**
- Scenario 3 (Toxicity): **Achievable** (correlation validation)
- Scenario 4 (Refill): **Achievable if refill event occurs**
- Scenario 5 (Reporting): **Achievable** (automated from Day 1)

**Minimum pilot scope to validate 3/5 scenarios:**
- 1 water body with multiple sampling points
- Duration: 4-6 months (to capture seasonal variation)
- Sampling frequency: Daily to weekly

## The Positioning Statement

For conversations with prospects:

> **"Your wetlands are a black box. You get 4 data points a year, and each one takes a month to come back. By the time you know something's wrong, the season's over.**
>
> **We turn on the lights. Our biosensor measures the biologically relevant fraction—the compounds that actually correlate with toxicity—and delivers results in 24-72 hours. But data alone isn't enough.**
>
> **Our platform correlates every reading with temperature, flow, depth, dosing, and your operational history. It finds patterns you didn't know to look for.**
>
> **The 5 scenarios we've validated from Kearl—seasonal optimization, spatial routing, toxicity targeting, refill recovery, regulatory evidence—those are examples. The real value is what we'll discover together.**
>
> **We're not selling you 5 reports. We're selling you the operational intelligence to make decisions you couldn't make before."**
