# Summary of NA-Specific Revisions - October 2025

## Purpose of Revisions

All Luminous materials were revised to clarify that:
1. **The biosensor specifically targets Naphthenic Acids (NAs)**—not all contaminants
2. **NAs are one of the principal contaminants** preventing regulatory approval for water release
3. **Other contaminants exist** (metals, salts, suspended solids, other organics) that operators must also monitor
4. **Confluent is currently focused on NA intelligence**, with architecture expandable to other contaminant data over time

This scoping ensures technical accuracy and prevents overstating the solution's scope.

## Key Phrases Added Throughout All Documents

### Contextual Framing:
- "NAs are one of the principal contaminants of concern preventing regulatory approval for water release"
- "Tailings water contains multiple contaminants (metals, salts, suspended solids, other organics), but NAs are the bottleneck"
- "You cannot get release approval—even if everything else is clean—if NA levels aren't demonstrated to be safe"
- "While operators must monitor multiple contaminants, NAs are the specific bottleneck Luminous addresses"

### Biosensor Scoping:
- "Biosensor specifically targets Naphthenic Acids"
- "Peer-reviewed technology specifically engineered for rapid NA detection"
- "Does not monitor other contaminants"
- "Three-panel NA detection system"

### Confluent Scoping:
- "Currently focused on NA intelligence"
- "AI-native data intelligence platform for NA management"
- "Architecture expandable to other contaminant data over time"
- "While currently focused on the NA bottleneck, Confluent's architecture is designed to eventually integrate data from other contaminant monitoring systems"

### Strategic Positioning:
- "Solving the NA bottleneck first"
- "NA monitoring gap"
- "NA treatment optimization"
- "NA transparency for stakeholders"

## Documents Requiring Review (Not Yet Revised)

### 5. White Paper
**File:** `AI-Native-Monitoring-White-Paper-REVISED-2025.md`
**Location:** `02-COMPANY-ASSETS/presentations/Internal Papers/`

**Status:** Partially scoped - mentions "naphthenic acid (NA) analysis" but should be reviewed for consistent NA scoping throughout like other documents.

**Recommended Action:** Apply similar NA-specific language patterns throughout the 10-page document.

---

## Why These Changes Matter

### Technical Accuracy:
- The biosensor **specifically targets NAs** through engineered bacterial biosensors designed for NA detection
- It does **not** detect metals (arsenic, selenium), salts, suspended solids, or other organic compounds
- Claiming broader monitoring capability would be technically inaccurate

### Credibility with Operators:
- Operators know the complexity of tailings water
- Overstating the solution scope undermines credibility
- Being specific about solving the **NA bottleneck** positions Luminous as experts, not generalists

### Competitive Positioning:
- Focusing on the NA bottleneck creates a defensible niche
- Avoids competing with comprehensive water quality labs
- Emphasizes complementary relationship with HRMS

### Investor Expectations:
- Prevents scope creep in investor expectations
- Clearly defines the beachhead market (NA monitoring)
- Shows expansion path (Confluent architecture can integrate other data)

### Regulatory Alignment:
- OSMWSC September 2025 recommendations explicitly identify NAs as key contaminant
- Solving the NA bottleneck directly addresses regulatory requirements
- Doesn't overcommit to monitoring all contaminants

## Before and After Examples

### Example 1: Solution Description
**Before (Too Broad):**
> "Luminous gives operators 24-hour test results so they can finally see what's happening in real-time and optimize treatment."

**After (NA-Specific):**
> "Luminous gives operators 24-hour NA results. Our peer-reviewed biosensor specifically targets Naphthenic Acids and complements HRMS accuracy with operational speed, so operators can finally see NA treatment effectiveness in real-time."

### Example 2: Three-Tier Strategy
**Before (Ambiguous):**
> "Tier 2: Operational Screening (Luminous Biosensor)
> Purpose: Daily operational monitoring, treatment optimization"

**After (NA-Specific):**
> "Tier 2: Operational NA Screening (Luminous Biosensor)
> Purpose: Daily operational NA monitoring, NA treatment optimization
> Target: Naphthenic Acids specifically (does not monitor other contaminants)"

### Example 3: Confluent Description
**Before (Overstated):**
> "Confluent transforms monitoring data into operational intelligence and stakeholder transparency."

**After (Accurately Scoped):**
> "Confluent transforms NA monitoring data into operational intelligence and stakeholder transparency. Currently focused on NA intelligence, the platform's architecture is designed to eventually integrate data from other contaminant monitoring systems as operators expand their comprehensive water treatment programs."

## Next Steps

1. **Review White Paper** for consistent NA scoping (similar treatment to Executive Brief)
2. **Update any marketing one-pagers or sales materials** with NA-specific language
3. **Brief team members** on accurate scoping language to use in customer conversations
4. **Update website copy** if it contains overgeneralized monitoring claims
5. **Create FAQ document** addressing "Do you monitor other contaminants?" for sales team
