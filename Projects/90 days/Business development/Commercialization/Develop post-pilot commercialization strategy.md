**Task:**

Develop post-pilot commercialization strategy

**Details:**

- Define go-to-market plans after pilot success
- Identify distribution channels, marketing campaigns
- Set sales targets and growth milestones


NOTE: What is considered the pilot studies? I would consider my current Genome Canada/ Imperial Oil funded project looking at NA concentrations in the Kearl constructed wetland treatment system a great pilot project. 

A 2nd pilot project is the proposed work with CNR, who are also developing a constructed wetland for treatment of tailings water in 2025. They have asked if the biosensor is available (yes) and what is the cost? I have not provided a cost, as I don't know how many samples they plan to test. I assume the # of sample in the range of 100-200, similar to my current Imperial Oil project. They seemed to need a rough, high level budget (no details) by the end of the year.

We are nearly finished our method development for concentrating NA from a water samples, which is especially useful in water with low NA concentrations. We have an extra challenge that other methods don't have it, which is providing the concentrate extract of NA back to bacterial growth media to grow our biosensor in. Other methods used the organic extracts and load the sample directly into an analytical machine.
