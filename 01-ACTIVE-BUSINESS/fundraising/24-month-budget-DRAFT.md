## Revenue Assumptions (Conservative)

| Pilot | Start Date | Year 1 Revenue | Year 2 Revenue |
|-------|------------|----------------|----------------|
| CNRL Albian | Q2 2026 | $130K (9 months prorated) | $48K (subscription) |
| Pilot #2 | Q4 2026 | $65K (6 months prorated) | $48K |
| Pilot #3 | Q1 2027 | $0 | $36K (9 months) |
| Pilot #4 | Q3 2027 | $0 | $24K (6 months) |
| **TOTAL** | | **$195K** | **$156K** |

**End of Year 2 ARR:** $192K (4 pilots × $48K subscription)

**Mentor Question:** Is $48K/year subscription realistic post-pilot? Or should we price higher ($75K-$100K)?

---

## Runway Analysis

### Scenario A: $1.5M Raised Now (Pre-Pilot Signature)

**Total Capital:** $1.5M
**Year 1 Burn:** $[TBD] - $195K revenue = $[TBD] net burn
**Year 2 Burn:** $[TBD] - $156K revenue = $[TBD] net burn
**Total 24-Month Burn:** $[TBD]
**Remaining Runway:** $[TBD] months beyond Month 24

**Risk:** If pilots delay or don't convert, runway shortened.

---

### Scenario B: Non-Dilutive Funding ($250K) + Pre-Seed ($1.25M)

**Total Capital:** $1.5M ($250K non-dilutive + $1.25M equity)
**Same burn, lower dilution:** 17-25% instead of 21-30%

**Mentor Question:** Is $250K non-dilutive realistic in 12-week timeframe? Or aspirational?

---

## Use of Funds Breakdown (Investor Pitch)

**Market Expansion (70%):** $1.05M
- Pilot deployments (3-4 sites): $[TBD]
- Commercial team scaling: $[TBD]
- Field support & integration: $[TBD]

**Product Hardening (15%):** $225K
- Biosensor ruggedization
- Confluent UX improvements
- Automated reporting

**Operations & Overhead (15%):** $225K
- Legal, accounting, insurance
- Facilities, software, admin

**Investor Message:** "70% of capital funds market expansion, not technology development. We're scaling proven tech."

---

## Mentor Validation Questions (Nov 27)

### Budget Reality Check:

1. **Headcount:** Can we run 2-3 pilots with current team + 1-2 FTEs? Or under-resourced?
2. **Pilot Costs:** Are we underestimating integration complexity? What's realistic per-pilot cost?
3. **Revenue:** Is $48K/year subscription too low? Should we price $75K-$100K based on $260K value?

### Use of Funds:

4. **Market vs. Tech:** Is 70% market expansion / 15% product hardening the right split?
5. **Outsourcing:** Should we outsource field support instead of hiring? More flexible, lower fixed costs?

### Timing:

6. **Non-Dilutive:** Is $250K in 12 weeks realistic? Or should we lower target to $100K-$150K?

---

## Next Steps

1. **Populate Numbers** (by Nov 27)
   - Personnel costs (current salaries + market rates for new hires)
   - CAPEX estimates (Confluent infrastructure, biosensor lab)
   - Pilot deployment costs (travel, integration, sample analysis)

2. **Mentor Validation** (Nov 27 call)
   - Headcount reality check
   - Use of funds split (market expansion vs. tech completion)
   - Revenue assumptions (subscription pricing)

3. **Finalize Budget** (Week 4)
   - Adjust based on mentor feedback
   - Create `24-month-budget-FINAL.md`
   - Use finalized budget to validate $1.5M target or adjust
