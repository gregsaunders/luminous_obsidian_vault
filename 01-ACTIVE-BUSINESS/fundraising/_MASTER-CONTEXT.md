## Key Strategic Questions for Nov 27 Mentor Call

### Valuation Defense (TRL 7-8 Positioning)

**Core Thesis:**
We're not asking investors to fund R&D risk. We're asking them to fund **market expansion of proven technology** (TRL 7-8). This fundamentally changes valuation.

**Questions for Mentors (Terence/Dave):**
1. What's realistic pre-money valuation for TRL 7-8 clean tech with customer validation but pre-revenue?
2. Should we raise NOW at $5M-$7M pre-money, or wait for pilot success and raise at $10M+?
3. How do we defend higher valuation based on capital efficiency and de-risked technology?

### Budget & Use of Funds

**Critical Decision:** Where does $1.5M go?
- **Market expansion** (pilot deployments, commercial scale-up) → supports higher valuation
- **Technology completion** (biosensor improvements, platform features) → suggests lower valuation

**Questions for Mentors (Jocelyn/Doug/Terence):**
1. Are we under-resourced or over-hiring? (Year 1: +1-2 FTEs, Year 2: +2-3 FTEs)
2. Can we actually run 2-3 pilots with current team + 1-2 FTEs?
3. Should we outsource (field support, integration) instead of hiring?

### Timing Strategy

**Options:**
- **A.** Raise NOW (pre-pilot) at $5M-$7M pre-money → 21-30% dilution, capital to execute confidently
- **B.** Raise POST-pilot signature (Q2 2026) at $8M-$12M → 12-18% dilution, but burns 6 months runway
- **C.** Raise POST-pilot success (Q4 2026) at $12M-$20M → 7-12% dilution, but runway critically low

**Question:** What's our runway reality? Can we bootstrap to higher valuation or do we need capital NOW?

## Week 1-4 Priorities (Before Budget Finalization)

**Tasks:**
1. Document investment to date (capital, sweat equity, IP) → `valuation-framework.md`
2. Draft 24-month budget with realistic assumptions → `24-month-budget-DRAFT.md`
3. Map non-dilutive funding opportunities → `non-dilutive-funding.md`
4. Prepare mentor validation questions (above) for Nov 27 call

## Version History

### v1.0 (2025-11-17) - Initial Setup
- Created fundraising folder structure (lean start - 5 files)
- Established valuation defense framework (TRL 7-8 positioning)
- Identified key mentor validation questions for Nov 27 call
- Priority: Budget finalization (Week 1-4) to validate $1.5M target

**Key Insight:** Fundraising is NOW Objective #2 priority (moved from #3) - can't raise without credible budget + pilot traction.
