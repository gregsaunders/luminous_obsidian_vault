    3. The broader group of mentors discusses the objectives.
        
    4. The moderator concludes, and the venture team exits to debrief.
        
- **Founder's Role:** Expect to listen more than talk85. The discussion is among the mentors for your benefit.

#### Part 3: Deliberations

- **Description:** A closed-door meeting at the end of the day attended only by CDL mentors, moderators, and select partners. Founders are not present.
