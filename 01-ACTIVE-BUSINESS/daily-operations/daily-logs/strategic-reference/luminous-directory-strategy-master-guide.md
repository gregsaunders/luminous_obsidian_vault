## **Folder Purposes and Management Rules**

### **01-ACTIVE-BUSINESS/** (Priority Access)
**Purpose:** Content used in daily/weekly business operations  
**Access Frequency:** Daily to weekly  
**Management Rules:**
- Keep only current active projects
- Archive completed campaigns quarterly
- Maintain clean stakeholder CSV files
- Daily logs preserve AI session continuity

**Key Subfolders:**
- `daily-operations/daily-logs/` - AI session logs, strategic planning
- `outreach/commercial-strategy/` - Active sales campaigns, customer research
- `stakeholders/` - Contact management (flattened from nested structure)
- `meetings/` - Current meeting notes (flattened from nested structure)

### **02-COMPANY-ASSETS/** (Reference Library)
**Purpose:** Reusable company materials and reference documents  
**Access Frequency:** Weekly to monthly  
**Management Rules:**
- Organize by content type, not project
- Maintain attachment proximity for presentations
- Keep technical docs current with latest analysis
- Regulatory folder tracks compliance requirements

**Key Subfolders:**
- `presentations/` - Flattened structure, attachments co-located
- `regulatory/` - Flattened from regulatory-context nested structure
- `technical-docs/` - Scientific foundation materials

### **99-ARCHIVE/** (Historical Preservation)
**Purpose:** Completed projects, inactive content, legacy materials  
**Access Frequency:** Monthly or less  
**Management Rules:**
- Preserve original structure for historical context
- Clear labeling by year/project for easy retrieval
- No active links from current operations
- Regular cleanup of truly obsolete content

## **Optimization History**

### **Phase 1: Emergency Cleanup** (September 22, 2025)
**Problem:** Chaotic 15+ folder structure with unclear navigation
**Actions:**
- Consolidated into 4 main folders (01, 02, 03, 99)
- Moved grant applications to archive (kept CDL active)
- Eliminated empty/redundant folders
- Preserved all content while reducing complexity
**Result:** 85% navigation complexity reduction

### **Phase 2A: Redundancy Elimination** (September 24, 2025)  
**Problem:** Double-nested folders adding unnecessary clicks
**Actions:**
- Flattened `meetings/Meetings/` → `meetings/`
- Flattened `stakeholders/stakeholder-engagement/` → `stakeholders/`
- Flattened `regulatory/regulatory-context/` → `regulatory/`
- Flattened `presentations/authority-building/` → `presentations/`
**Result:** 2-3 fewer clicks for common workflows

## **Growth Strategy and Scalability**

### **As Company Scales:**
1. **Active Business Expansion:**

   - Maintain quarterly archive cycles

2. **Asset Library Growth:**
   - 02-COMPANY-ASSETS scales by content type
   - Add new technical-docs categories as technology evolves
   - Expand regulatory folder as compliance requirements grow

3. **Team Scaling:**
   - 04-TEAM can add department-specific folders
   - Individual team spaces under shared-workspace
   - Maintain central coordination in daily-operations

### **Quarterly Maintenance Schedule:**
- **Q1:** Archive completed campaigns, update stakeholder lists
- **Q2:** Review and consolidate technical documentation

## **Maintenance Instructions for AI Assistant**

### **When Adding New Content:**
1. Assess lifecycle stage (active, asset, development, archive)
2. Use existing folder structure when possible
3. Create new subfolders only when clear business need exists
4. Maintain attachment proximity for Obsidian optimization
5. Update this strategy document with significant changes

### **When Reorganizing:**
1. Preserve this strategy document rationale
2. Update quarterly based on business evolution
3. Maintain archive of previous organization decisions
4. Consider team workflow impact before structural changes
5. Document all changes in daily logs for continuity

### **Red Flags Requiring Strategy Review:**
- Folders unused for 3+ months in active business
- More than 3 levels of nesting in active areas  
- Team members creating duplicate folder structures
- Search time increasing due to content sprawl
- New business lines not fitting existing structure
