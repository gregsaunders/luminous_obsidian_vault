---

## What We Worked On

### 1. Jocelyn McMinn (Lead Mentor) Slack Communication
**Context:**
- Had informal outreach to Jocelyn already
- Needed to schedule Nov 27 objectives review meeting
- Wanted to sequence: Lead Mentor alignment FIRST, then full mentor kickoff

**Key Decision:**
- Slack message sent requesting Nov 27 meeting (30-45 min)
- Presented 3 Sprint 2 objectives for validation
- Included Max Zhang MBA student intro
- Added 4th question: "How can we best leverage each mentor's expertise across these objectives?"

**Strategic Learning:**
- Right sequencing: Lead Mentor validates objectives → Full team kickoff
- Prevents wasted time if objectives need revision

---

### 2. Mentor Team Objectives Consensus Email
**Goal:** Get mentor consensus on Sprint 2 objectives by Nov 21 (CDL deadline)

**Email Structure:**
- To: Jocelyn McMinn
- CC: Terence Tham, Dave Lee, Doug Beach, Michael Lipsett, Denis Streltsov
- Three objectives presented (Pilot, Messaging, Capital)
- Max Zhang MBA student intro included
- Four specific questions for feedback

**Tone Calibration:**
- Jeff revised my initial draft (was "over flattering" and "kiss assy")
- **Jeff's style learned:**
  - ✅ Direct and concise ("great feedback" not "incredible feedback")
  - ✅ Professional appreciation without gushing (thank once, not repeatedly)
  - ✅ No excessive enthusiasm ("looking forward" = unnecessary)
  - ✅ Uses "~" for approximate numbers (realistic, not overprecise)
  - ❌ Avoid "transformative," "excited," excessive superlatives

---

### 3. Doodle Poll for Mentor Kickoff Meeting
**Purpose:** Schedule full mentor team kickoff (post-Nov 27 Jocelyn call)

**Meeting Objectives (6 items):**
1. Finalize Sprint 2 objectives (review consensus, address questions)
2. Establish working rhythm (check-in cadence, communication preferences)
3. Map mentor expertise to objectives (how we can best leverage your experience)
4. **Identify relevant relationships we can leverage (operators, engineering firms, regulatory contacts, funding sources)**
5. Prioritize first 4 weeks (what needs to happen now to set up success)
6. AER engagement strategy (initial game plan per Patrick's guidance)

**Key Decision:**
- Item #4 broadened from "Oil Sands relationships" to include engineering firms, regulatory contacts, funding sources
- Captures ALL leverage opportunities (operators, partnerships, AER, non-dilutive funding, investors)

**Format:** 60-90 minutes (in-person at Haskayne or virtual)

---

### 4. Max Zhang MBA Student Pairing Analysis

**Background Discovery:**
- **Kearl Oil Sands Project experience** (2013-2014, Thermon) - Same site as Luminous field validation!
- **Energy & Environmental Law expertise** (7 years, Dalian Maritime University)
- **Regulatory/policy specialist** (North America, Asia, Middle East)
- **Data analytics** (Google Advanced Data Analytics certified July 2025)
- **Bar admission** (Oregon State Bar, active since 2017)

**Strategic Assessment:**
- This is a **jackpot match** for Luminous
- Perfect fit for Patrick Elliott's AER engagement mandate
- Rare combination: oil sands operational knowledge + regulatory expertise

**Three Project Options Developed:**

**Option 1: AER Engagement Strategy (RECOMMENDED)**
- Stakeholder mapping (who owns tailings water release guidelines)
- Proactive engagement approach (co-hosted with pilot customer)
- Regulatory timeline analysis (12-18 month window)
- **Deliverable:** AER Engagement Playbook

**Option 2: Operational Intelligence Platform Positioning**
- Operator pain point research (cost of 6-8 week HRMS delays)
- Competitive landscape analysis
- ROI calculator framework (24hr vs 3-month value)
- **Deliverable:** Messaging Playbook

**Option 3: Offshore Europe Market Research**
- Regulatory landscape (UK, Norway offshore oil & gas)
- Market sizing and potential customers
- Entry barriers and partnership opportunities
- **Deliverable:** Market Entry Strategy

**Approach Decision:**
- Present all three options collaboratively
- Invite Max's ideas and expertise
- Let him express his talents and interests
- This is partnership, not task assignment

---

### 5. Max Zhang Intro Email (Warm Relationship Building)

**Jeff's Direction:** "I want this to be friendly and build on a relationship before we jump right into it. We can dive deep in the initial call"

**Email Structure:**
- Short and warm
- Genuine curiosity about Kearl background
- Simple agenda (get to know each other, explore project ideas)
- No heavy project details (save for call)
- Shows homework done without overwhelming

**Key Learning:**
- Relationship-first approach (consistent with Jeff's style from Oct 31 outreach session)
- Collaborative tone more important than information density

---

### 6. Max Zhang Call Prep Document Created

**File:** `03-DEVELOPMENT/partnerships/CDL-Application/Max Zhang - Intro Call Prep.md`

**Structure:**
- Pre-read materials (Executive Brief + Solution Overview)
- Call agenda (4 sections, 30-45 min total)
- Three project options with deliverables
- Questions for Max (collaborative framing)
- Key points to emphasize
- Outcomes checklist

**Jeff's Feedback:** "I want you to be conscience on not being overly detailed and verbose. I want this document to be very neat and easy to execute on."

**Tone Calibration:**
- Clean, executable, collaborative
- No excessive explanatory text
- Bullet-driven, scannable format

---

### 7. CDL-Application Folder Cleanup

**Problem:** 18 files in CDL-Application folder, many obsolete (pre-Session 1, application phase)

**Solution Implemented:**
- Created archive structure: `archive/pre-session-1/` and `archive/session-1-prep/`
- Moved 12 pre-Session 1 files to archive (application materials, prep docs)
- Moved 3 Session 1 prep files to archive (templates, prep packages)
- **Result:** 3 active files remaining (Program Hub, Max Zhang Prep, LRD Notes)

**Benefits:**
- Clean workspace for Sprint 2
- Easy navigation (only current work visible)
- Preserved history (archived, not deleted)
- Scalable structure for new Sprint 2 documents

## Key Decisions Made

### 1. Communication Sequencing Strategy
- Lead Mentor (Jocelyn) objectives review FIRST (Nov 27)
- Full mentor team kickoff SECOND (after Jocelyn validates objectives)
- Prevents rework if objectives need adjustment

### 2. Relationship Leverage Scope
- Broadened from "Oil Sands relationships" to full ecosystem:
  - Oil sands operators (CNRL, Suncor, Imperial)
  - Engineering firms (Stantec, Integrated Sustainability, WSP, AECOM)
  - Regulatory contacts (AER, Indigenous consultation)
  - Non-dilutive funding sources (Alberta Innovates, NRC IRAP, COSIA)
  - Adjacent industries (offshore, mining, refinery)
  - Investor networks

### 3. Max Zhang Project Approach
- Present three options collaboratively (not directive)
- Invite his ideas and expertise
- Emphasize mutual value (not just "here's what we need")
- Relationship-building first, project scoping second

### 4. Folder Organization Philosophy
- Archive historical work (don't delete)
- Keep active folder clean (3 files max for Sprint 2 start)
- Scalable structure for growth

## Key Learnings

### 1. Jeff's Communication Style (Critical for Future Work)

**Tone Characteristics:**
- Direct and concise (no excessive flattery)
- Professional appreciation without gushing
- Businesslike closing (simple "Thanks again for your support")
- No email signature fluff (name, title, phone only)
- Uses "~" for approximate numbers (shows realistic thinking)
- Avoids superlatives ("transformative," "incredible," "excited")

**What to Avoid:**
- ❌ "Over flattering" or "kiss assy" language
- ❌ Repeated thank-yous in same message
- ❌ Excessive enthusiasm markers ("looking forward," "can't wait")
- ❌ Overly verbose explanations

**What Works:**
- ✅ "Great feedback" (not "incredible feedback")

### 2. Collaborative vs. Directive Approach
- For MBA student partnership: present options, invite ideas, emphasize mutual value
- Consistent with Jeff's Oct 31 relationship-building approach (Ty Vaness "too aggressive" correction)
- Partnership > Task Assignment

### 3. Strategic Sequencing Matters
- Lead Mentor alignment before full team kickoff
- Objectives consensus before Doodle poll (or note "agenda pending finalization")
- Pre-read materials before collaborative discussions

### 4. Max Zhang Match Quality
- Rare alignment: Kearl operational experience + regulatory expertise + data analytics
- Perfect fit for Patrick Elliott's AER mandate ("Get into their kitchen")
- Example of how CDL pairing process can deliver exceptional value
