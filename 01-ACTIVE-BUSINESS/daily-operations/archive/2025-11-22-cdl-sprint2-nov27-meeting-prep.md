# CDL Sprint 2 - Nov 27 Meeting Prep Session

**Session Date:** 2025-11-22
**Session Type:** CDL Program Management & Pilot Proposal Development
**Status:** Complete

---

## Session Overview

Final preparation for Nov 27 mentor meeting with Jocelyn McMinn. Focus on Dave Lee's feedback about pilot economics, pricing strategy development (cost recovery + grant matching), and comprehensive pilot deliverables documentation.

---

## What We Worked On

### 1. Dave Lee Feedback Analysis

**Dave's Slack Message:**
> "If you come in with the intention but no financial and operational metrics they tend to either dictate those terms and/or slow roll the discussion... Make it as easy as you can for them to take the medicine they need."

**Interpretation:**
- Operators will control the negotiation if you don't set the frame
- Need specific pricing, timeline, deliverables ready
- "Make it easy" = pre-answer objections, minimize their work

### 2. Pilot Proposal Material Assessment

**Reviewed files in operational-intelligence folders:**
- pilot-Proposal V1.4 (strong foundation)
- critical-assumptions-audit.md (guardrails)
- sprint-01 through sprint-04 research documents

**Assessment:**
- ✅ ROI/Financial Metrics: Excellent ($260k, 5-month payback)
- ✅ Operational Plan: Excellent (9-month timeline, zero-friction)
- ✅ Validated Claims: Excellent (Kearl data)
- 🔴 Pricing: Missing (was "[Insert Cost]")
- 🟡 Deliverables: Incomplete (needed tangible "what you get")

### 3. Nov 27 Meeting Agenda Created

**New file:** `Nov-27-Mentor-Meeting-Agenda.md`

**Tight 45-60 min structure:**
1. Sprint 2 Objectives Check (10 min)
2. Pilot Economics Review (15 min) - Dave's feedback
3. Relationship Leverage for Objective 1 (15 min)
4. Priority Actions Weeks 1-4 (10 min)
5. Next Steps (5 min)

Includes talking points and outcomes checklist.

### 4. Pilot Proposal Pricing Strategy Developed

**Jeff's Strategic Direction:**
- Cost recovery only (no profit margin)
- Volume-based sampling (not per-test)
- ERA/Alberta Innovates 50% grant matching
- Frame as "test as much as makes sense for highest resolution"

**Rationale:** "No-brainer" positioning - CNRL pays 50% of actual costs for $260k/year ROI system.

**Added to Pilot Proposal Section 9:**
- Cost structure table with placeholders
- Grant matching table
- Risk reversal guarantee (3/5 scenarios by Month 6)
- Pilot-to-contract conversion incentive
- Data ownership & confidentiality terms
- Cost of waiting analysis with competitive urgency

### 5. Pilot Deliverables Section Created

**New Section 8: "Pilot Deliverables: What You Get"**

Four tangible asset categories:

**A. Readiness Baseline Report (Regulatory Asset)**
- Toxicity trend analysis
- Compliance-ready documentation
- Benchmark dataset

**B. Operational Intelligence Package (Efficiency Asset)**
- Seasonal operating window analysis
- Spatial performance map
- Refill recovery curves
- Treatment response profiles
- Anomaly detection library

**C. ROI Validation Report (Business Case Asset)**
- Validated savings by scenario
- Payback analysis
- Expansion ROI projections

**D. Future Project Intelligence (Strategic Asset)**
- Treatment technology recommendations
- Monitoring protocol optimization
- Regulatory submission roadmap

**Key positioning:** "These deliverables don't expire when the pilot ends. They become your baseline, playbook, and competitive advantage."

### 6. CDL-Application Folder Cleanup

Reorganized 18 files down to 3 active + archive:
- Active: Program Hub, Max Zhang Prep, LRD Notes
- Archive: pre-session-1 (12 files), session-1-prep (3 files)

---

## Files Created/Modified

### Created:
1. **Nov-27-Mentor-Meeting-Agenda.md** - Tight meeting agenda for Jocelyn call
2. **Archive folders** - pre-session-1/, session-1-prep/

### Modified:
1. **pilot-Proposal V1.4** - Added Section 8 (Deliverables) and Section 9 (Investment/Pricing)
2. **Luminous - CDL Program Hub.md** - Updated action items, Max Zhang info

---

## Key Decisions Made

### 1. Pricing Strategy: Cost Recovery + Grant Matching
- No profit margin on pilot (relationship investment)
- 50% grant matching = CNRL pays half
- Volume-based sampling (more = higher resolution)
- Risk reversal guarantee de-risks commitment

### 2. Meeting File Structure
- Created new Nov-27 agenda file (tight, executable)
- Keep Sprint-2-Objectives-Draft.md as reference document
- Sprint-2-Tracker.md for ongoing task tracking

### 3. Deliverables as Tangible Assets
- Four categories of permanent operational assets
- Positions value beyond "9 months of tests"
- Expansion lever built in (multi-site ROI projections)

---

## Key Learnings

### 1. Dave Lee's "Make It Easy" Philosophy
Operators don't want to figure out if your solution makes sense. They want:
- Specific pricing with clear ROI math
- Minimal work on their side
- Pre-answered objections
- Risk mitigation (guarantees, data ownership)

### 2. Cost Recovery as Sales Strategy
Removing profit margin:
- Eliminates "vendor margin" negotiation
- Signals relationship investment
- Makes 50% grant matching even more compelling
- Positions pilot as "proving value" not "selling service"

### 3. Deliverables = Lasting Assets
Framing pilot outputs as permanent operational assets:
- Justifies budget internally ("here's what we get")
- Creates stickiness (switching = starting over)
- Sets up expansion conversation ("imagine this at all sites")
- Supports regulatory submission (baseline documentation)

### 4. Volume-Based vs. Per-Test Pricing
"More samples = higher resolution" aligns incentives:
- Operator wants maximum data
- Luminous wants maximum validation
- Removes "how few tests can we get away with" mindset

---

## Next Steps

### Before Nov 27:
1. **Fill in pilot cost placeholders with Greg/Shawn** (only remaining item)
   - Lab consumables & materials
   - Labor (analysis, reporting)
   - Confluent platform setup
   - Readiness report

### Nov 27 Meeting:
2. Review meeting agenda and talking points
3. Validate pricing strategy with Jocelyn
4. Identify mentor relationship leverage
5. Confirm Week 1-4 priorities

### Post-Nov 27:
6. Full mentor team kickoff (Doodle sent)
7. Finalize pilot proposal with validated pricing
8. Submit ERA/AI grant applications

## Critical Insights for Future Sessions

### Pilot Proposal Polish Elements:
1. **Risk Reversal Guarantee** - "3/5 scenarios by Month 6 or free extension"
2. **Pilot-to-Contract Conversion** - Credits toward Year 1 annual contract
3. **Data Ownership** - Explicit: operator owns all data
4. **Competitive Urgency** - "Suncor and Imperial are evaluating solutions"
5. **First-Mover Advantage** - "Validated baselines = expedited release authorization"

### What Makes a "No-Brainer" Pilot:
- Cost recovery pricing (no vendor margin to negotiate)
- Grant matching (operator pays 50%)
- Validated ROI with specific $ figures
- Tangible deliverables (not just "monitoring service")
- Risk mitigation (guarantees, data ownership)
- Clear next steps (30-min discovery → grant coordination → agreement → deployment)

## Session Artifacts

### Documents Ready for Nov 27:
1. **Nov-27-Mentor-Meeting-Agenda.md** - Meeting guide
2. **pilot-Proposal V1.4** - Complete with pricing & deliverables (needs cost numbers)
3. **Sprint-2-Objectives-Draft.md** - Reference document
4. **Sprint-2-Tracker.md** - Task tracking

### Remaining Gaps:
1. Cost placeholders ($[TBD]) need Greg/Shawn input

---

**Session Success Criteria Met:**
- ✅ Dave Lee feedback analyzed and addressed
- ✅ Meeting agenda created (tight, executable)
- ✅ Pricing strategy developed (cost recovery + grant matching)
- ✅ Deliverables section added to pilot proposal
- ✅ Folder structure cleaned up
- ✅ Only one action remaining (cost numbers)
