Meeting notes:

- **Test Results Discussion:** Jeff asked Shawn to provide more details about the recent test results, which Shawn explained involved using an Agar plate to visualize the chemical reaction. This method allowed them to see a ring of luminescence around the chemical, even with actual tailings water, which was significant for their research.
    - **Test Method:** Shawn explained that instead of using liquid, they used an Agar plate to visualize the chemical reaction. This method allowed them to see a ring of luminescence around the chemical.
    - **Sample Preparation:** Shawn detailed that they used actual tailings water, evaporated it down to a small volume, and then spotted it on the Agar plate. This concentrated the sample, allowing them to see the luminescence.
    - **Concentration Levels:** Shawn mentioned that they tested two or three levels of concentrations that were positive, while the rest were negative. This helped them understand the necessary concentration for detection.
    - **Visualization:** Shawn noted that the ring of luminescence was faint but visible, indicating the presence of the chemical in the complex mixture of tailings water.
- **Field Testing Feasibility:** Jeff inquired if the new testing method could be used in the field. Shawn clarified that while the current method requires a special camera in the lab, there are other ways to conduct field tests.
    
- **Next Meeting Schedule:** Jeff proposed to reconvene the meeting in one week, which was agreed upon by Greg and Shawn. They decided to meet on Monday at 1:00 PM after Shawn's lab meeting.

    - **Target List:** Jeff plans to use LinkedIn and other tools to build a focused target list for their outreach efforts, aiming to educate and engage with these contacts continuously.
- **Alternative Feedstocks for Plastics:** Shawn discussed the potential of using microbial fermentation to produce feedstocks for plastics instead of petrochemicals. This method could be a future alternative to traditional oil-based plastics production.
    - **Microbial Fermentation:** Shawn discussed the potential of using microbial fermentation to produce feedstocks for plastics, which could be an alternative to traditional oil-based plastics production.
    - **Scaling Challenges:** Shawn mentioned that the challenge lies in scaling up the microbial fermentation process to make it cost-effective.
    - **Biodegradable Plastics:** Shawn noted that there are already biodegradable plastics available, but the cost of production is currently higher than traditional plastics.
- **Regulatory Engagement:** Jeff highlighted the importance of engaging with regulators and helping them understand the issues related to naphthenic acids (NAs) in tailings ponds. They discussed the potential impact on oil sands providers and the need for a remediation plan.
