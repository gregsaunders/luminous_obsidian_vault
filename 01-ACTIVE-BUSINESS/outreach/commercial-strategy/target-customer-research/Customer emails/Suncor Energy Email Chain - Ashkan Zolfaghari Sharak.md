### Email 4: June 25, 2025 - Technology Overview & Value Proposition
**From:** Jeff Violo  
**Subject:** Re: intro to Luminous Biosolutions  

**Technology Foundation:**
- Work stems from Dr. Shawn Lewenza's NA biosensor research
- Validated through GROW project at Kearl Wetland
- Focus on integrated platform for tailings management

**Two Key Scientific Breakthroughs:**

1. **Core Technology Published:**
   - NA biosensor technology in ACS Synthetic Biology
   - Proven ability to rapidly detect NAs in raw OSPW samples
   - Participated in Kearl GROW wetland project
   - Biosensor performance consistent with Mass Spec
   - Summer publication planned for these results

2. **Industry Opportunity Defined:**
   - Multi-year Kearl constructed wetland study published
   - Confirms wetlands effective at degrading NAs
   - **Critical finding:** degradation rate slows >50% as season progresses

**Strategic Solution:**
- Use rapid biosensors to guide targeted bioaugmentation service
- Enhance naturally occurring microbial processes
- Maintain higher, more consistent NA degradation rates
- Key to accelerating reclamation timelines

**Meeting Availability Offered:**
- Monday, July 1st (Afternoon)
- Tuesday, July 2nd (Afternoon) 
- Wednesday, July 3rd (Morning)
