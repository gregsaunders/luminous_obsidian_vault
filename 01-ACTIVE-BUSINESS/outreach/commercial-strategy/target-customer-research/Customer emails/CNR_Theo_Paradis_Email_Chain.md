### Email 6: July 22, 2025 - Initial Partnership Proposal
**From:** Jeff Violo  
**Subject:** ERA Tailings Technology Challenge - Meeting Request (Follow-up to Shawn's Update)  
**Recipients:** Theo Paradis, Jayne Rattray

**Technology Progress Recap:**
- CNR's investment delivered peer-reviewed biosensor technology
- Field-validated at Kearl
- Natural next step: bioaugmentation using NA-degrading bacteria identified through biosensor screening
- ERA Tailings Technology Challenge requires industry partners by September 24th

**Strategic Value for CNR:**
- Low financial commitment: 16.7% cost share (ERA covers 50%, three operators split remainder)
- Minimal operational impact: OSPW samples and technical input only
- De-risked approach: four-year scale-up from mesocosms to operational deployment with decision gates
- Leverages existing investment: direct progression from research to operational solution

**Requirements:**
- Meeting with Theo and Jayne in next two weeks
- Partnership details discussion
- Proposal approach alignment
- Jayne's NA expertise invaluable for technical approach

**Timeline:** September 24th deadline approaching, need committed industry partners

## Analysis Summary

**Relationship Status:** Initially promising, ultimately rejected due to budget constraints.

**Key Issues:**
- 2026 budget unavailability
- Required involvement of Jayne Rattray for project decisions
- Internal prioritization process for ERA funding
- Strategic pivot came too late in process

**Decision Factors:**
- Cost and budget timing
- Project ranking against other ERA opportunities
- Technical team involvement requirements
- Strategic focus changes (bioaugmentation vs. monitoring)

**Lessons Learned:**
- Earlier budget alignment conversations needed
- Importance of consistent technical approach
- Need for earlier stakeholder alignment
- Budget cycle timing critical for partnership decisions
