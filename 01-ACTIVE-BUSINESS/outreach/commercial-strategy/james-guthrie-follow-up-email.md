# Follow-up Email - James Guthrie


Hi James,

It was great catching up and getting your perspective on the tailings environment. Your insight on operators needing clear water specification targets before they'll consider moving from containment to release mode was gold.

I attended the Mikisew Cree Water Quality Criteria for Indigenous presentation you recommended, which gave me an entirely new perspective! Megan and Mandy are impressive people. The data they have compiled is extensive; you must be glad you're not going toe-to-toe with them anymore!

I'd love your thoughts and technical challenge on our approach. You know Imperial's operations better than anyoneâ€”does this make sense for how treatment systems actually work?

Also, if you think the timing's right, I'd appreciate an introduction to Rodney Guest at Suncor.

Thanks again for the great conversation and all the insights. I always appreciate having a friend who can tell me when I'm missing something important!

Cheers, Jeff
