## Strategic Framework: Dual-Track Approach

### Core Principle
**Generate revenue from current monitoring needs while building foundation for larger market opportunity**

## Track 1: Immediate Revenue Targets

### Primary Customer: Technical Champions with Budgets

**Who:** Senior Engineers/Scientists at oil sands operators currently managing monitoring programs

**Current Pain:** 
- Waiting 6-8 weeks for HRMS results from external labs
- Making treatment decisions with outdated data
- Struggling to optimize treatment systems without real-time feedback

**Value Proposition:** 
- 24-hour NA results vs. 6-8 week lab turnaround
- Enable real-time treatment optimization
- Reduce reliance on expensive external lab analysis

**Revenue Model:** Subscription-based unlimited screening
- Replace external lab costs with biosensor platform
- Position as "operational intelligence" not regulatory compliance

### Secondary Customer: Environmental Consultants

**Who:** Consulting firms (WSP Golder, Stantec, AECOM) billing clients for monitoring services

**Value Proposition:**
- Offer faster, cheaper screening to consulting clients
- Enable consultants to provide more frequent monitoring
- Differentiate consulting services with "24-hour NA data"

**Revenue Model:** Technology licensing or partnership

### Tertiary Customer: Research Collaborations

**Who:** Universities with industry-funded research projects

**Value Proposition:**
- Enable high-frequency monitoring for research studies
- Support peer-reviewed publications
- Provide platform for academic validation

**Revenue Model:** Research partnerships, equipment sales

## Key Questions for Jeff

1. **Cash Flow Timeline:** How long can Luminous operate before needing revenue?
2. **Pilot Budget:** What budget range would early customers need for pilot programs?
3. **Community Approach:** Should we approach Indigenous communities for relationship building or wait until we have paying customers?
4. **Risk Tolerance:** How aggressively should we pursue immediate revenue vs. long-term market foundation?
