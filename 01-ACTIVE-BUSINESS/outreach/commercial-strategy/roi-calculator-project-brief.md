# ROI Calculator Development Project

**Project Manager:** Claude  
**Priority:** High - Direct commercial impact  
**Timeline:** 1-2 weeks development  
**Status:** Project initiated

## **Project Objective**

Create interactive ROI calculator demonstrating economic advantage of Tier 2 biosensor screening vs HRMS-only approach for oil sands monitoring programs.

## **Calculator Components Needed**

### **Input Variables**
- **Monitoring Area Size** (hectares or operational units)
- **Current HRMS Sampling Frequency** (samples/month)  
- **Proposed Biosensor Frequency** (samples/month)
- **HRMS Cost per Sample** ($700-1,000 range)
- **Treatment System Optimization Value** ($/month operational improvement)

### **Output Calculations**
- **Current Annual Monitoring Costs** (HRMS only)
- **Enhanced Monitoring Costs** (Biosensor + HRMS validation)
- **Net Cost Savings** from reduced HRMS dependency  
- **Operational Value** from real-time optimization
- **Total ROI** and payback period

### **Scenarios to Model**
1. **Small Operation:** 10 samples/month → 100 samples/month with biosensor
2. **Medium Operation:** 25 samples/month → 300 samples/month  
3. **Large Operation:** 50 samples/month → 500+ samples/month

## **Information Still Needed from Jeff**

### **Critical Data Points**
- [ ] **Biosensor cost per sample** (what should we estimate?)
- [ ] **Operational improvement value** ($/month from treatment optimization)
- [ ] **HRMS validation frequency** (what % of biosensor samples need HRMS confirmation?)
- [ ] **Platform operational costs** (Confluent subscription, maintenance, etc.)

### **Market Intelligence**
- [ ] **Typical monitoring budgets** for different sized operations
- [ ] **Treatment optimization value examples** (cost savings from better data)
- [ ] **Current sampling frequency** by operator type

## **Development Approach**

### **Phase 1: Simple Calculator (Week 1)**
Excel-based calculator with scenario modeling for internal use during sales conversations

### **Phase 2: Interactive Tool (Week 2)**  
Web-based or presentation-ready calculator for customer demonstrations

## **Next Steps**
Jeff to provide missing data points for calculator variables, then development begins immediately.
