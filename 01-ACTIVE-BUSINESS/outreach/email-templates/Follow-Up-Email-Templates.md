# Follow-Up Email Templates

**Created:** October 2025
**Purpose:** Customer follow-up communications for different audience types

## Template 1: James Guthrie Follow-Up (Technical Audience - Post-Meeting)

**Subject:** Following up - Operational monitoring for [specific project/treatment system]

Hi James,

Following up on our conversation about monitoring challenges for [specific treatment system or project he mentioned]. I wanted to circle back on [specific technical question or challenge he raised].

Quick context on what we discussed: Our biosensor platform provides 24-hour NA quantification with R=-0.98 correlation to Orbitrap MS. We're positioned as Tier 2 operational screening—complementing HRMS for compliance, not replacing it. Detection range is 2-30 mg/L across three biosensors targeting different NA classes.

With OSMWSC's September recommendations emphasizing operational monitoring and technology transparency, we're seeing interest from operators looking to establish high-frequency monitoring capabilities ahead of the release standards timeline.

**Would it make sense to schedule 20 minutes next week to discuss how this might fit [his specific project/operational need]?**

I can share the detailed technical validation data (peer-reviewed ACS Synthetic Biology paper + field pilot results) if that would be helpful for your evaluation.

Best regards,
Jeff Violo
COO, Luminous BioSolutions

## Template 2: Clint Johnson Follow-Up (Business/Regulatory Audience - Post-Meeting)

**Subject:** OSMWSC compliance leadership opportunity - operational monitoring

Hi Clint,

Following up on our conversation about [specific business challenge or regulatory concern he mentioned]. I wanted to reconnect on the timing opportunity created by OSMWSC's September recommendations.

The regulatory shift is clear: operators need operational monitoring capabilities (not just compliance reporting) to manage treatment systems effectively. The challenge is that HRMS can't scale to the required frequency—$700-1,000/sample with 6-8 week turnaround makes real-time process management impossible.

**Our positioning:** 24-hour operational screening (R=-0.98 HRMS correlation) enables treatment optimization between compliance sampling events. The key differentiator is we're not just providing monitoring technology—we're including OSMWSC stakeholder engagement support to help early adopters establish compliance leadership positioning.

**Business impact:**
- Regulatory advantage: 12-18 month lead on OSMWSC compliance requirements
- Operational intelligence: Real-time treatment optimization vs historical data
- Social license: Technology transparency built into pilot programs

**Would you be open to a 30-minute call next week to discuss how this fits [his company's] strategy for the upcoming regulatory timeline?**

I can share our executive brief covering the market timing and competitive positioning if that would be useful context.

Best regards,
Jeff Violo
COO, Luminous BioSolutions

## Template 3: Target 20 Cold Contact (Engineering Consultants - Initial Outreach)

**Subject:** Operational monitoring solution for oil sands clients—24-hour NA results

Hi [Name],

I'm reaching out because [specific reason: you work with operators on treatment system design / you're involved in OSPW remediation projects / your firm provides environmental monitoring services].

**The challenge we're hearing:** OSMWSC's September recommendations require operational monitoring capabilities, but HRMS turnaround times (6-8 weeks) make real-time treatment optimization impossible. Operators need frequent data but can't afford $700-1,000/sample at the required frequency.

**What we've built:** Biosensor platform providing 24-hour NA quantification with R=-0.98 correlation to Orbitrap MS. Peer-reviewed validation (*ACS Synthetic Biology*, 2024) with field pilot data from operational treatment systems.

**Why this matters for consultants:**
- Service differentiation: Only firm offering 24-hour operational screening to clients
- Premium pricing opportunity: Enhanced monitoring services with real-time recommendations
- Competitive advantage: Early adopter positioning ahead of OSMWSC compliance timeline

We're currently working with [mention any relevant contacts if applicable] and looking to partner with 2-3 engineering firms who want to differentiate their monitoring service offerings.

**Would it make sense to schedule 20 minutes in the next two weeks for a brief technical overview?**

No pressure—just wanted to put this on your radar given the regulatory timing.

Best regards,
Jeff Violo
COO, Luminous BioSolutions

## Template 4: Target 20 Cold Contact (Operators - Initial Outreach)

**Subject:** OSMWSC compliance advantage—high-frequency monitoring for treatment systems

Hi [Name],

I'm reaching out because [specific reason: you're managing treatment pilots / you're involved in tailings water management / your operation is advancing remediation technologies].

**The regulatory timing:** OSMWSC's September recommendations require operational monitoring capabilities for treatment systems. The challenge is HRMS can't scale to the required frequency—operators need real-time feedback but 6-8 week turnaround times make treatment optimization impossible.

**What we've developed:** Biosensor platform providing 24-hour NA quantification (R=-0.98 Orbitrap MS correlation) for operational screening between HRMS compliance events. Detection range 2-30 mg/L with minimal sample preparation.

**Key differentiator:** We're not just providing monitoring technology—pilot programs include OSMWSC stakeholder engagement support to help early adopters establish compliance leadership positioning.

**Validation:** Peer-reviewed publication (*ACS Synthetic Biology*, 2024), University of Calgary independent validation, multi-season field pilot completed.

We're looking to partner with 1-2 operators for pilot programs in Q1 2026.

**Would it make sense to schedule 30 minutes in the next few weeks for a technical briefing?**

I can share detailed validation data and discuss how this fits your specific treatment timeline and monitoring strategy.

Best regards,
Jeff Violo
COO, Luminous BioSolutions

## Template 5: Response to "Send Me Information" Request

**Subject:** Re: [Previous subject line]

Hi [Name],

Great to hear you're interested. I've attached two documents:

1. **Executive Brief** - Market context, OSMWSC regulatory timing, and business case (2 pages)
2. **Technical Data Sheet** - Performance specs, validation data, and appropriate use cases (1 page)

**Key highlights:**
- **Performance:** R=-0.98 correlation with Orbitrap MS, 24-hour turnaround
- **Validation:** Peer-reviewed (*ACS Synthetic Biology*, 2024), field pilot completed
- **Positioning:** Tier 2 operational screening to complement HRMS compliance analysis
- **Differentiator:** Integrated stakeholder engagement support for OSMWSC transparency requirements

**After you've had a chance to review, would you be open to a 20-30 minute call to discuss application to [their specific project/challenge]?**

Happy to answer any technical questions or provide additional validation data.

Best regards,
Jeff Violo
COO, Luminous BioSolutions

## Template 6: Meeting Request After No Response

**Subject:** Re: [Previous subject line] - Still interested?

Hi [Name],

I wanted to check back in on my previous email about operational monitoring for [specific project/challenge mentioned].

I know things get busy—if timing isn't right, no worries at all.

If you're still interested, I'm happy to schedule a brief call in the next few weeks. The regulatory timeline around OSMWSC recommendations is creating some urgency for operators looking to establish monitoring capabilities ahead of release standards.

Let me know if it makes sense to reconnect.

Best regards,
Jeff Violo
