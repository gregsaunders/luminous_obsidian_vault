  # Temperature - Primary driver for Q10 rate modification
  - id: Temp_Water
    name: Water Temperature
    description: >-
      Water temperature in the treatment wetland. Affects treatment kinetics
      through Q10 temperature coefficient. Higher temperatures generally
      increase biological activity and treatment rates.

  # UV Index - Affects photodegradation rates
  - id: UV_Relative
    name: UV Index (Relative)
    description: >-
      Relative UV intensity affecting photodegradation of contaminants.
      Normalized to 0-1 scale where 1.0 represents peak summer UV.
      Affected by season, cloud cover, and water surface conditions.

  - id: DO_Typical
    name: Dissolved Oxygen
    description: >-
      Typical dissolved oxygen concentration in the treatment water.
      Critical for aerobic biodegradation processes. DO below 6.5 mg/L
      may limit treatment efficiency.

  # Turbidity - Affects UV penetration and bioavailability
  - id: Turbidity
    name: Turbidity
    description: >-
      Water clarity measure affecting UV penetration depth and potentially
      contaminant bioavailability. Higher turbidity reduces photodegradation
      effectiveness.

  - id: pH_Water
    name: Water pH
    description: >-
      pH of the treatment water. Affects chemical speciation of contaminants
      and microbial activity. Optimal range for most treatment processes
      is 6.5-8.5.
