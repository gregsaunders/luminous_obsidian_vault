    name: Season Start Month
    description: >-
      Month when the treatment season begins. May (5) is typical for
      northern climates when water temperatures become suitable for
      biological treatment processes.

  - id: Season_Start_Day
    name: Season Start Day
    description: >-
      Day of the month when treatment operations begin. Mid-month (15)
      provides buffer for seasonal variability and site preparation.

      Month when the treatment season ends. September (9) is typical,
      before water temperatures drop below treatment thresholds.

      Day of the month when treatment operations end. Mid-month (15)
      allows time for system shutdown and winterization.

    name: Treatment Days
    description: >-
      Total number of active treatment days in the season. This is the
      primary driver for capacity calculations and value projections.
      Also referenced as Season_Length.
