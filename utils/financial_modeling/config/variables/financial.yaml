  # Triangular Distribution Variables
  - id: Season_Extension_Days
    name: Season Extension Days
    description: >-
      Additional treatment days gained through wetland optimization.
      Represents the extension of the operational treatment season beyond
      the baseline scenario.
    unit: days
    distribution: triangular
    params:
      min: 14
      mode: 21
      max: 35
      stoch_name: Stoch_SeasonExt
      stoch_label: Season_Extension
    sheet: 7_ServiceModels
    is_input: true

  - id: Extension_Value_Per_Day
    name: Extension Value Per Day
    description: >-
      Economic value generated per additional treatment day.
      Includes operational savings, avoided costs, and productivity gains.
    unit: $/day
    distribution: triangular
    params:
      min: 3000
      mode: 7500
      max: 15000

    sheet: 7_ServiceModels
    is_input: true

  - id: Interventions_Avoided
    name: Interventions Avoided
    description: >-

    distribution: triangular
    params:
      min: 1
      mode: 3
      max: 8

  - id: Treatment_Rate_Factor
    name: Treatment Rate Factor
    description: >-
      Multiplier on the baseline treatment rate, capturing seasonal
      and vegetation variability. Based on Kearl kinetics data with
      uncertainty around optimal conditions.
    unit: multiplier
    distribution: triangular
    params:
      min: 0.70
      mode: 1.00
      max: 1.30

      optimization. Uses Beta distribution to model bounded improvement
      with a mode around 15-20%.
    unit: fraction
    distribution: beta
    params:
      alpha: 2
      beta: 5
      min: 0.05
      max: 0.40
      stoch_name: Stoch_Efficiency
      stoch_label: Efficiency_Gain
