# Ionic Variables - Water quality parameters affecting treatment and compliance
# These variables are monitored for regulatory compliance gates.

category: ionic

variables:
  # Salinity - Affects microbial activity and compliance
  - id: Salinity
    name: Salinity
    description: >-
      Total dissolved salts in the treatment water. High salinity can
      inhibit microbial activity and may trigger compliance gates for
      discharge to freshwater ecosystems.
    unit: ppt
    distribution: triangular
    params:
      min: 0.5
      mode: 2.0
      max: 5.0
    drivers: []
    sheet: 5_EnvironmentalDrivers
    is_input: true

  # Sodium Adsorption Ratio - Critical for land discharge
  - id: SAR
    name: Sodium Adsorption Ratio
    description: >-
      Ratio indicating sodium hazard for irrigation or land application.
      SAR > 4.0 typically triggers compliance gate failure. Critical
      parameter for treated water discharge options.
    unit: ratio
    distribution: triangular
    params:
      min: 1.0
      mode: 2.5
      max: 6.0
    drivers: []
    sheet: 5_EnvironmentalDrivers
    is_input: true

  # Chloride - Compliance parameter
  - id: Chloride
    name: Chloride Concentration
    description: >-
      Chloride ion concentration. Regulatory threshold typically
      230 mg/L for aquatic life protection. Elevated chloride can
      indicate process water intrusion.
    unit: mg/L
    distribution: triangular
    params:
      min: 50
      mode: 150
      max: 300
    drivers: []
    sheet: 5_EnvironmentalDrivers
    is_input: true

  # Sulfate - Process water indicator
  - id: Sulfate
    name: Sulfate Concentration
    description: >-
      Sulfate ion concentration. Elevated levels may indicate
      process water contribution. Monitored for compliance and
      as a treatment performance indicator.
    unit: mg/L
    distribution: triangular
    params:
      min: 100
      mode: 300
      max: 600

  # Clay Fraction - Affects bioavailability modifier
  - id: Clay_Fraction
    name: Clay Fraction
    description: >-
      Fraction of clay particles in the substrate/sediment.
      Higher clay content reduces contaminant bioavailability
      through sorption, affecting treatment efficiency.
    unit: fraction (0-1)
    distribution: triangular
    params:
      min: 0.05
      mode: 0.15
      max: 0.30
