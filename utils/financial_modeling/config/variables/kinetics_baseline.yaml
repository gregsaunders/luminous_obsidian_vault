variables:
  - id: Initial_NAFC
    name: Initial NAFC Concentration
    description: >-
      Starting NAFC (Naphthenic Acid Fraction Compounds) concentration
      in mg/L. This is the inlet concentration that treatment must reduce
      to meet compliance targets.
    unit: mg/L
    distribution: fixed
    params:
      value: 40
    sheet: 4_Assumptions
    is_input: true
    drivers: []

  - id: Target_NAFC
    name: Target NAFC Concentration
    description: >-
      Compliance target for NAFC concentration in mg/L. Treatment must
      reduce Initial_NAFC to this level or below for water release.
    unit: mg/L
    distribution: fixed
    params:
      value: 1
    sheet: 4_Assumptions
    is_input: true
    drivers: []

  - id: Rapid_Phase_Rate
    name: Rapid Phase Degradation Rate
    description: >-
      First-order degradation rate constant (k) for the rapid phase
      of NAFC treatment. Higher rate reflects easily biodegradable
      fraction of NAFC mixture.
    unit: 1/day
    distribution: fixed
    params:
      value: 0.15
    sheet: 4_Assumptions
    is_input: true
    drivers: []

  - id: Slow_Phase_Rate
    name: Slow Phase Degradation Rate
    description: >-
      First-order degradation rate constant (k) for the slow phase
      of NAFC treatment. Lower rate reflects recalcitrant fraction
      requiring longer treatment times.
    unit: 1/day
    distribution: fixed
    params:
      value: 0.03
    sheet: 4_Assumptions
    is_input: true
    drivers: []

  - id: Rapid_Phase_Duration
    name: Rapid Phase Duration
    description: >-
      Number of days in the rapid degradation phase before transitioning
      to slow phase kinetics. Determined by substrate availability and
      microbial community dynamics.
    unit: days
    distribution: fixed
    params:
      value: 14
    sheet: 4_Assumptions
    is_input: true
    drivers: []

  - id: Recirculation_Cycle
    name: Recirculation Cycle Time
    description: >-
      Days per recirculation cycle for water treatment. Shorter cycles
      increase treatment intensity but require more pumping energy.
    unit: days
    distribution: fixed
    params:
      value: 7
    sheet: 4_Assumptions
    is_input: true
    drivers: []
