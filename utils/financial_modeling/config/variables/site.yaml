# Site Variables - Site configuration parameters for wetland operations
# These define the physical and operational characteristics of the treatment wetland.

category: site

variables:
  - id: WetlandAreaHa
    name: Wetland Area (Ha)
    description: >-
      Total treatment wetland area in hectares. Standard design is 1.0 ha,
      based on scaling from Kearl pilot (0.76 ha) to commercial operations.
    unit: ha
    distribution: fixed
    params:
      value: 1.0
      source: Standard design (Kearl pilot = 0.76 ha)
    sheet: 4_Assumptions
    is_input: true

  - id: TreatmentCells
    name: Treatment Cells
    description: >-
      Number of discrete treatment cells in the wetland system. Multi-cell
      design (5) allows operational flexibility, staged treatment, and
      maintenance without full system shutdown.
    unit: count
    distribution: fixed
    params:
      value: 5
      source: Multi-cell design
    sheet: 4_Assumptions
    is_input: true

  - id: AnnualThroughputM3
    name: Annual Throughput (M3)
    description: >-
      Annual water treatment capacity in cubic meters. Based on hydraulic
      loading rate (HLR) of 0.05 m3/m2/day applied to wetland area over
      the treatment season.
    unit: m3/yr
    distribution: fixed
    params:
      value: 50000
      source: HLR = 0.05 m3/m2/day
    sheet: 4_Assumptions
    is_input: true

  - id: ValuePerM3
    name: Value Per M3
    description: >-
      Economic value generated per cubic meter of water treated. Derived
      from total annual value ($250K/yr) divided by throughput (50K m3/yr).
      This is the base case value before stochastic adjustments.
    unit: $/m3
    distribution: fixed
    params:
      value: 5.00
      source: $250K/yr / 50K m3/yr (Section 6)
    sheet: 4_Assumptions
    is_input: true
