Adding **Ion Imbalance** to your variable library is not just a "good idea"—it is a regulatory necessity. While we have focused on _breaking down_ naphthenic acids, Ion Imbalance is the factor that often determines whether you are actually allowed to _release_ that water into the Athabasca River.

In a controlled wetland, the sun and bacteria can "clean" the water of organic toxins, but they cannot "re-balance" the inorganic chemistry. If you ignore this, you might end up with water that is chemically "clean" of acids but biologically "incompatible" with the river.

### 1. What is Ion Imbalance?

In the Athabasca Oil Sands, the extraction process (using sodium hydroxide) and the constant recycling of water create a high concentration of **Sodium (Na+)** and **Chloride (Cl−)**.

Natural northern rivers have a specific "Ionic Signature" dominated by **Calcium (Ca2+)** and **Magnesium (Mg2+)**. When the sodium levels in your treated water are too high relative to calcium and magnesium, you have an **Ion Imbalance**.

### 2. The Key Metric: Sodium Adsorption Ratio (SAR)

In your engineered wetland, you must track a specific ratio called the **SAR**. It is calculated as:

SAR=21​([Ca2+]+[Mg2+])![](data:image/svg+xml;utf8,<svg%20xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"%20width="400em"%20height="1.88em"%20viewBox="0%200%20400000%201944"%20preserveAspectRatio="xMinYMin%20slice"><path%20d="M983%2090l0%20-0c4,-6.7,10,-10,18,-10%20H400000v40H1013.1s-83.4,268,-264.1,840c-180.7,572,-277,876.3,-289,913c-4.7,4.7,-12.7,7,-24,7s-12,0,-12,0c-1.3,-3.3,-3.7,-11.7,-7,-25c-35.3,-125.3,-106.7,-373.3,-214,-744c-10,12,-21,25,-33,39s-32,39,-32,39c-6,-5.3,-15,-14,-27,-26s25,-30,25,-30c26.7,-32.7,52,-63,76,-91s52,-60,52,-60s208,722,208,722c56,-175.3,126.3,-397.3,211,-666c84.7,-268.7,153.8,-488.2,207.5,-658.5c53.7,-170.3,84.5,-266.8,92.5,-289.5zM1001%2080h400000v40h-400000z"></path></svg>)​[Na+]​

- **The Soil Risk:** If you release water with a high SAR into a wetland or riverbank, the sodium pushes the calcium and magnesium off the clay particles in the soil. This causes the soil to "disperse" (turn into a tight, waterproof muck), killing the vegetation and causing massive erosion.
    
- **The Aquatic Risk:** Fish and amphibians depend on specific osmotic pressures. High sodium/chloride levels can interfere with their ability to regulate their internal salt levels, leading to "physiological drought" even when they are swimming in water.

### 3. Impact on the Engineered Wetland

An engineered wetland is particularly sensitive to this variable because the plants you choose (Cattails, Sedges, Willow) have different "SAR Tolerances."

|Variable|Impact of Ion Imbalance|Consequence for the Wetland|
|---|---|---|
|**Plant Health**|High sodium interferes with potassium uptake.|**Stunting:** Plants become smaller and less efficient at providing the "Co-metabolism" (Variable 10) needed for NA breakdown.|
|**Water Flow**|High SAR causes clay in the wetland substrate to swell.|**Clogging:** The "Hydraulic Conductivity" drops, meaning your pumps can't move water through the root zones effectively.|
|**Microbial Stress**|High ionic strength (salinity) dehydrates bacterial cells.|**Slowdown:** The "Metabolic Switch" (Variable 2) stays at a lower setting, even in the heat of summer.|

### 4. How to Mitigate Ion Imbalance

Since a wetland cannot "eat" sodium, you must use physical or mineral strategies to balance the water before or during the treatment:

1. **Cation Exchange (The Gypsum Strategy):** Many operators add **Gypsum (CaSO4​)** to the water. This adds Calcium (Ca2+) to the mix, which lowers the SAR and helps "knock" the sodium off the clay particles, keeping the soil and plants healthy.
    
2. **Dilution (Runoff Management):** You mentioned using "the best water." By mixing cleaner runoff water (which is high in natural minerals) with process-affected water, you naturally lower the SAR.
    
3. **Halophytic Plants:** Using salt-tolerant plants (halophytes) in the first "cell" of your wetland can help manage the initial shock, though they don't significantly remove the salt from the system.
    

### Summary for your Variable Library

**Ion Imbalance** is the "Compatibility Variable." If you don't manage it, you can't release the water. It turns the "Safe to Release" goal into a math problem: it’s not just about how _low_ the NAs are, but how _balanced_ the salts are.
