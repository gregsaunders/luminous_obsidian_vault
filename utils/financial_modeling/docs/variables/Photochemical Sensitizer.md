n the natural environment of an oil sands tailings pond, **Variable H (Photochemical Sensitizers)** refers to "helper" molecules that are not NAs themselves but play a massive role in their destruction.

Even without artificial catalysts, the pond water contains natural components that act like a "relay team," catching sunlight and passing that energy along to destroy naphthenic acids.

### 1. The Natural Sensitizers: Nitrates and Humic Acids

Oil sands process water contains a complex soup of **Dissolved Organic Matter (DOM)**, which includes **Humic Acids**(from soil) and **Nitrates** (from process additives or natural runoff).

- **How they work:** Unlike NAs, which are relatively "transparent" to most sunlight, these sensitizers are very good at absorbing UV radiation. When a photon hits a Nitrate ion or a Humic Acid molecule, it doesn't just bounce off; it puts the molecule into an **"excited state."**
    
- **The Reaction:** To return to its normal state, the excited molecule must release that energy. It does this by reacting with the surrounding water to produce **Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS)**, such as:
    
    - **Hydroxyl Radicals (⋅OH)**
        
    - **Singlet Oxygen (1O2​)**
        
    - **Superoxide (O2⋅−​)**
        
- **The Result:** These ROS act as chemical "bullets." They strike the NAs, breaking their carbon rings and making them easier for bacteria to eat.
    

### 2. The "Filter" vs. "Sensitizer" Paradox

Humic acids (the dark, tea-colored organic matter) present a unique challenge in your analysis because they play two opposing roles:

|Role of Humic Acids|Effect on NAs|
|---|---|
|**As a Sensitizer**|They absorb light and create ROS, which helps **break down** NAs.|
|**As an Optical Filter**|Because they turn the water dark, they **block** sunlight from reaching NAs deeper in the water.|
|**As a Binder**|NAs can physically "bind" to humic acids. Research shows that NAs tucked into humic structures are **protected** from further degradation.|

### 3. Impact of Other Natural "Helpers"

Beyond DOM and Nitrates, other natural constituents in the OSPW (Oil Sands Process-Affected Water) contribute to this indirect photolysis:

- **Iron Salts (Fe3+):** Natural iron in the tailings can undergo the **Photo-Fenton reaction**. Under sunlight, iron reacts with natural peroxides in the water to create even more hydroxyl radicals.
    
- **Bicarbonates:** On the flip side, high levels of **Bicarbonates** (common in alkaline ponds) can act as "radical scavengers." They "steal" the reactive oxygen before it can hit an NA molecule, effectively slowing down the sun's cleaning power.
    

### 4. Why This Matters for Your Analysis

This variable explains why "clearer" process water—even without technology—often cleans itself much faster than raw tailings. In a clear pond:

1. **Nitrates** and **Iron** at the surface produce a steady stream of "chemical bullets" (ROS).
    
2. The lack of **Turbidity** allows these ROS to be generated at greater depths.
    
3. The NAs are "attacked" from two sides: directly by UV-B and indirectly by the ROS created by the sensitizers.
    

### Summary of Natural Photolysis Variables

|Variable|Increase in Variable|Effect on NA Breakdown|
|---|---|---|
|**Nitrates**|Increase|**Accelerates** (more ROS production).|
|**Humic Acids**|Increase|**Mixed.** Helps at the very surface, but blocks light for the rest of the pond.|
|**Iron (Fe3+)**|Increase|**Accelerates** (Photo-Fenton effect).|
|**Bicarbonates**|Increase|**Inhibits** (scavenges/wastes the reactive oxygen).|
