By utilizing this dual-method approach, the **Performance Dashboard** stops being a simple spreadsheet and becomes a **Chain of Custody**. In the eyes of the **Alberta Energy Regulator (AER)** and local Indigenous communities, "certainty" is not found in a single clean test; it is found in the high-frequency evidence of a transformation.

### 1. The Critical Need for High-Frequency Testing

In a dynamic engineered wetland, water chemistry can shift in hours due to a heavy rainstorm, a sudden summer heatwave, or a pump failure. Low-frequency testing (e.g., monthly) creates "blind spots" where the **Toxicity Bounce**could occur and subside without being detected.

**High-frequency testing (Real-time to Weekly) provides:**

- **Operational Control:** Immediate feedback on whether the wetland flow rate needs to be slowed down to increase **Residence Time**.
    
- **Safety Assurance:** Ensuring no "pulses" of metabolites (the Toxicity Bounce) escape the final treatment cell.
    
- **Regulatory Trust:** A continuous data stream is much harder to dispute than a handful of manual samples.

### 2. The Forensic Performance Dashboard

This dashboard is designed to prove that the water has been "environmentally processed" from the moment it enters the wetland until it is deemed safe for release.

#### Checkpoint A: The Inlet (Raw Baseline)

- **Biosensor Goal:** Establish the baseline "Bioactivity Score." This tells us how aggressive the NAs are to living cells.
    
- **HRMS Goal:** Map the "Parent" O2​ structures. We identify the specific **Aged vs. Fresh** profile (Variable J) to set the treatment strategy.
    

#### Checkpoint B: Mid-Cell (The Transformation Zone)

- **Biosensor Goal:** **Detect the Bounce.** We expect a _spike_ in biosensor activity here. If the biosensor "glows" brighter or triggers stress reporters, we know the **Co-metabolism (Variable 10)** is working—breaking the rings into more active (but temporary) metabolites.
    
- **HRMS Goal:** Confirm the shift from O2​→O3​/O4​. This is the forensic proof that the NAs are being oxidized. If we see O4​ increasing, the "chemical disassembly" is on track.
    

#### Checkpoint C: The Outlet (Release Readiness)

- **Biosensor Goal:** **Zero Bioactivity.** The biosensor must return to a "null" state, matching the response of natural river water. This proves the toxicity is gone, regardless of the remaining chemical count.
    
- **HRMS Goal:** **The Molecular Clearance.** We verify that the "Diamondoid" multi-ring NAs (Variable J) have been snapped. HRMS must show that the complex Z-series has collapsed into simple, short-chain organic acids that occur naturally in the boreal environment.

### 3. Why This Dashboard Creates "Release Certainty"

By focusing on **Environmental Forensic Science**, you address the three biggest fears of the regulator:

1. **The "Hiding" Toxin Fear:** Biosensors detect _effect_, not just _presence_. If a molecule is there but doesn't trigger the biosensor, it isn't bioavailable or toxic (Variable 11).
    
2. **The "Metabolite" Fear:** By testing at high frequency in the "Mid-Cell," you prove you are monitoring the **Toxicity Bounce** and keeping it contained within the wetland.
    
3. **The "Persistence" Fear:** HRMS provides the "Molecular DNA" of the water. You can prove exactly which carbon rings were broken, leaving no room for "Aged NA" surprises (Variable J).
    

### The "Forensic" Recommendation

To gain absolute certainty, I recommend that your high-frequency **Biosensor** data be uploaded to an **Immutable Ledger (Blockchain)** or a transparent multi-stakeholder dashboard. This prevents any accusations of "cherry-picking" data and allows the regulator to see the wetland's health in real-time.
