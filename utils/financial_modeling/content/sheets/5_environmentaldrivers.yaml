    Monthly profiles for key environmental variables affecting treatment kinetics.
    Temperature drives Q10 rate modifier (rates double per 10C above 20C).
    UV intensity affects photodegradation rates.
    Dissolved oxygen controls aerobic biodegradation.
    Nutrient availability influences microbial activity.
    Bioavailability accounts for sorption and binding effects.

    purpose: "Define monthly averages for environmental variables that affect treatment kinetics"
    assumptions: |
      - Monthly values represent typical conditions for the treatment season
      - Values are interpolated for daily calculations
      - Site-specific profiles can override defaults
