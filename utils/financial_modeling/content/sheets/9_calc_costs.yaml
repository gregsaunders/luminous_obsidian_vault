    This sheet calculates the annual cost of the selected testing approach.

    Cost Components:
    - Testing frequency: How often samples are taken (daily vs weekly vs monthly)
    - Sample points: Number of locations monitored per test event
    - Cost per test: Lab analysis cost for HRMS or sensor cost for Biosensor
    - Season length: Number of active treatment days per year

    Formula: Annual_Cost = (Season_Days / Test_Interval) x Sample_Points x Cost_Per_Test

    The testing option parameters come from 3_Assumptions (Test Options table).
    Biosensor has higher frequency but much lower cost per test, resulting
    in comparable or lower total annual costs with far better data resolution.

columns:
  Testing_Option: "Selected testing method (from 1_TOC dropdown)"
  Test_Interval: "Days between tests (1 for Biosensor, 7-30 for HRMS)"
  Sample_Points: "Number of monitoring locations per test event"
  Cost_Per_Test: "Unit cost per sample analysis"
  Tests_Per_Season: "Total number of test events per treatment season"
  Annual_Cost: "Total testing cost for the season"
