    This sheet calculates value that HRMS testing CANNOT capture due to its
    42-day latency. Each scenario requires a response faster than HRMS allows.

    The "Gating" Logic:
    - HRMS has 42-day turnaround from sample to results
    - All four scenarios require decisions within 3-14 days
    - Therefore, HRMS is always BLOCKED; Biosensor (1-day) is ENABLED

    Value Calculation:
    - Gated_Value = Base_Value x Stoch_Mult (if ENABLED)
    - Gated_Value = $0 (if BLOCKED)

    Since the selected Testing_Option is Biosensor (1-day latency), all
    scenarios are ENABLED and contribute value. If HRMS were selected,
    all would be BLOCKED and total value would be $0.

columns:
  Scenario: "Value scenario identifier (S1-S4)"
  Base_Value: "Deterministic value from 4_Scenarios (annual benefit if captured)"
  Gate_Status: "ENABLED if testing latency allows action, BLOCKED if too slow"
  Stoch_Mult: "Monte Carlo multiplier from 7_Calc_Stochastic (varies each iteration)"
  Gated_Value: "Base_Value x Stoch_Mult if ENABLED, else $0"
