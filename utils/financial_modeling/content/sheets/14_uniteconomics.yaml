    This sheet expresses all values on a per-m3 basis for comparability.

    WHY UNIT ECONOMICS MATTER:
    - Allows comparison across different site sizes
    - Enables scaling estimates to new deployments
    - Provides intuitive metrics for operator discussions
    - Connects to industry benchmarks (treatment costs, ARO liabilities)

    KEY METRICS:
    - Value per m3: Total value divided by annual throughput
    - Cost per m3: Testing cost divided by throughput
    - Net per m3: Value minus cost per unit volume
    - NPV per m3: 5-year NPV divided by total 5-year throughput

    BENCHMARKS (from 2_Instructions):
    - Operational value: $3-8/m3 (this model's output)
    - Avoided treatment: $10-30/m3 (alternative treatment costs)
    - ARO liability: $21-93/m3 (Zhang 2026 analysis)

    The biosensor's value per m3 can be compared against these benchmarks
    to understand its contribution relative to the total value stack.
