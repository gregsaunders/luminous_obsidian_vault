  title: "Monthly P&L View"
  content: |
    This sheet is a placeholder for future monthly P&L projections.

    CURRENT STATUS: Not implemented in this version.

    FUTURE USE CASES:
    - Monthly cash flow timing for working capital analysis
    - Seasonal revenue recognition patterns
    - Monthly cost accruals
    - Intra-year variance analysis

    The model currently uses annual projections (12_PL_Annual) as the
    primary financial view. Monthly detail would add complexity without
    significant benefit for the current valuation use case.

    If monthly detail is needed, the structure should mirror 12_PL_Annual
    with columns for each month and rows for:
    - Gross Value by scenario
    - Testing costs
    - Operating expenses
    - Net monthly benefit
