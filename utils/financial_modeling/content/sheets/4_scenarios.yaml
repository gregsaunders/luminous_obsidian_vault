  content: |
    This sheet defines the four value scenarios that biosensor monitoring enables.

    Each scenario represents value that CANNOT be captured with HRMS testing
    because HRMS's 42-day latency exceeds the required response time.

    The scenarios are additive - a single biosensor deployment captures
    all four value streams simultaneously.

    Scenario values are calibrated from the Financial Model Framework
    ($250K/year total operational value) allocated across scenarios
    based on relative importance and frequency.

      - Values are additive (a single biosensor deployment captures all four simultaneously)
      - Base values calibrated from $250K/year total operational value allocation
      - Required response days based on operational decision-making windows
      - HRMS 42-day latency blocks all scenarios; biosensor 1-day latency enables all
