  content: |
    This sheet tracks cumulative value capture over the projection horizon.

    KEY METRICS:
    - Cumulative Net: Running total of annual net benefits
    - Cumulative NPV: Running total of discounted net benefits
    - Payback Point: Year when cumulative value turns positive

    USE CASES:
    - Determine when investment breaks even
    - Assess cash flow timing for capital planning
    - Compare cumulative value vs upfront investment

    Note: This model assumes no upfront capital investment for the
    biosensor system (included in testing costs). For scenarios with
    capital expenditure, add an initial investment row and adjust
    payback calculations accordingly.

columns:
  Year: "Projection year"
  Annual_Net: "Net benefit for this year (from 12_PL_Annual)"
  Cumulative_Net: "Running total of Annual_Net"
  Annual_NPV: "Discounted net benefit for this year"
  Cumulative_NPV: "Running total of discounted benefits"
