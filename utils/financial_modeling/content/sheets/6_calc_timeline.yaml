    This sheet generates the projection timeline used throughout the model.

    Key outputs:
    - Year numbers (1-5) based on Projection_Years setting
    - Calendar years starting from Base_Year
    - Month indices for seasonal calculations

    The timeline drives all time-dependent calculations in sheets 8-15.
    Changing Projection_Years or Base_Year in 1_TOC updates this timeline.

columns:
  Year_Index: "Sequential year number (1, 2, 3...)"
  Calendar_Year: "Actual calendar year (Base_Year + Year_Index - 1)"
  Month_Index: "Month within year for seasonal calculations"
  Season_Active: "TRUE/FALSE indicating if month is within treatment season"

    purpose: "Generate the time dimension for all financial calculations"
    assumptions: |
      - Projection starts at Base_Year and extends for Projection_Years
      - Each year contains 12 months with season flags
      - Learning curve multiplier applied from tbl_LearningCurve
