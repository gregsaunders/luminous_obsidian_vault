    This sheet projects annual value capture over the planning horizon.

    KEY CALCULATIONS:
    - Gross Value: Sum of gated scenario values from 8_Calc_Value
    - Learning Curve: Year 1 at 50%, Year 2 at 75%, Year 3+ at 100%
    - Adjusted Value: Gross Value x Learning Curve Multiplier
    - Net Value: Adjusted Value - Testing Costs
    - NPV: Discounted sum using rate from 1_TOC

    LEARNING CURVE RATIONALE:
    Year 1 (50%): Pilot learning, process establishment
    Year 2 (75%): Initial optimization, expanded coverage
    Year 3+ (100%): Full operational maturity, steady state

    The learning curve can be adjusted in 3_Assumptions Section D.
    Conservative default reflects typical technology adoption patterns.

columns:
  Year: "Projection year (1-5)"
  Calendar_Year: "Actual calendar year"
  Gross_Value: "Total gated value before learning adjustment"
  Learning_Mult: "Learning curve multiplier for this year"
  Adjusted_Value: "Gross_Value x Learning_Mult"
  Testing_Cost: "Annual cost of selected testing approach"
  Net_Value: "Adjusted_Value - Testing_Cost"
  Discount_Factor: "1/(1+r)^n for NPV calculation"
  PV_Net: "Present value of Net_Value"
