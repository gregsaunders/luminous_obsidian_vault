    This dashboard presents the key outputs from the Monte Carlo simulation.

    PRIMARY METRICS:
    - Expected NPV: Mean of 1000 simulation iterations
    - P10/P50/P90: Confidence interval bounds
    - Probability NPV > 0: Likelihood of positive outcome

    INTERPRETATION GUIDE:
    - P10 = "Pessimistic but plausible" (10% of outcomes are worse)
    - P50 = Median outcome (equally likely to be higher or lower)
    - P90 = "Optimistic but plausible" (10% of outcomes are better)

    A narrow P10-P90 range indicates low uncertainty.
    P10 > 0 means even pessimistic scenarios show positive value.
