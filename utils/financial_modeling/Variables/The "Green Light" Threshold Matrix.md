## The "Green Light" Threshold Matrix

For a controlled wetland, we establish three "Gates." Each gate must be passed before the pumps move water to the next stage or eventually to the river.

### Gate 1: The Bio-Metabolic Handshake (Internal Flow)

**Purpose:** To ensure the **Toxicity Bounce** (Variable 10) is being managed and that **Co-metabolism** (Variable 10) is active.

- **Biosensor Threshold:** A 50% _increase_ in "Stress Reporter" activity relative to the inlet.
    
    - _Why?_ This confirms the bacteria are successfully "attacking" the complex NAs. We actually want to see a peak here to prove the "Bounce" is happening inside the wetland, not later in the river.
        
- **HRMS Threshold:** Detection of high-oxygen (O3​,O4​) metabolites.
    
- **Action:** If these thresholds are hit, the water is cleared to move from the "Active Cell" to the "Polishing Cell."
    

### Gate 2: The Final Polishing Handshake (Pre-Release)

**Purpose:** To confirm the **Aged vs. Fresh Paradox** (Variable J) has been solved and the water is no longer bioactive.

- **Biosensor Threshold:** Bioluminescence levels must return to ±5% of the **Natural River Baseline**.
    
    - _Why?_ This is the "Functional Truth." If the biosensor can't distinguish the treated water from the river water, the toxicity is effectively zero.
        
- **HRMS Threshold:** Total disappearance of O2​ NAs with a Molecular Weight >300 Da and a Z-series ≤−10.
    
    - _Why?_ This proves the "Diamondoid" rings have been broken.

## The Master "Safe to Release" Variable List

To prove the water is safe for the Athabasca River, the following 13 variables must hit these integrated thresholds simultaneously:

|Variable Type|Variable|Regulatory/Forensic Threshold|
|---|---|---|
|**Functional**|**Toxicity (Biosensor)**|**Non-distinguishable** from Athabasca River baseline.|
|**Molecular**|**Refractory NAs (HRMS)**|**< 1 mg/L** of specific O2​ cyclized fractions.|
|**Ionic**|**Salinity (Chloride)**|**< 230 mg/L** (CCME Chronic limit for aquatic life).|
|**Ionic**|**SAR (Ion Balance)**|**SAR < 4** (To protect downstream soil/delta health).|
|**Oxygen**|**Dissolved Oxygen**|**> 6.5 mg/L** (Cold water species requirement).|
|**Nutrient**|**Residual Phosphorus**|**< 0.05 mg/L** (To prevent algae blooms in the river).|
|**Physical**|**Temperature**|**±3∘C** of current river temperature.|
|**Physical**|**Turbidity**|**< 10 NTU** (High clarity for photolysis and river health).|
|**Chemical**|**pH**|**6.5 – 8.5** (Standard river range).|
|**Metabolic**|**Metabolites (O3​/O4​)**|**Baseline levels** (Proves the "Bounce" has finished).|
|**Sorption**|**Bioavailability**|**Zero detectable** NA-clay complexes in effluent.|
|**History**|**Residence Time**|**Verified Log** of 45-60 days (seasonal dependent).|
|**Aged/Fresh**|**Z-Series Collapse**|**Shift from Z=−12 to Z=0,−2.**|

## Regulatory and Community Support Analysis

### 1. Provincial and Federal Regulators (AER / ECCC)

- **Status:** They are moving away from "Total Naphthenic Acid" and toward **Whole Effluent Toxicity (WET)** testing.
    
- **Support:** High. They favor the "Double-Key" approach (Biosensor + HRMS) because it provides **Forensic Certainty**. The Federal government (Environment and Climate Change Canada) is specifically interested in the "Aged vs. Fresh" molecular data to ensure no persistent toxins reach the Peace-Athabasca Delta.
    

### 2. Indigenous Communities (First Nations & Métis)

- **Status:** High skepticism of industry-led data.
    
- **Support:** Conditional. Support is strongest when the **Biosensor Baseline** is calibrated against **Traditional Knowledge** areas (e.g., using water from specific culturally significant reaches of the river as the "control").
    
- **The "Forensic" Value:** Indigenous groups have historically pushed for the use of "Advanced Science" like HRMS because it doesn't allow for the "hiding" of chemicals that older tests (like FTIR) might miss.
    

### 3. Data Availability

- **The Gap:** While we have "Safe" levels for things like Salt and Oxygen, the **exact HRMS molecular "limit"** for NAs is still being debated. Industry pilots are currently generating the "Baseline" data needed to set these laws.
    

### Summary of Recommendations

To gain the "Certainty" you seek, your project should not just report its own data. It should **Open-Source** the HRMS "Molecular Fingerprints" to a shared database. This allows Indigenous communities and regulators to run their own independent analysis on your raw data.
