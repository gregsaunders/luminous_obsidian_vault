### Variable J: The "Aged" vs. "Fresh" NAs Paradox

This variable describes the **inverse relationship** between the concentration of Naphthenic Acids and the difficulty of their removal.

#### 1. The Paradox Defined

- **Fresh NAs (The "Dirty" Water):** Found in active tailings. The concentration is high (e.g., 60–100 mg/L), but the molecules are "young." They have simple structures and long carbon tails. Bacteria and UV light can "grab" these easily.
    
- **Aged NAs (The "Clean" Water):** Found in runoff ponds or old inactive ponds. The concentration is low (e.g., 10–20 mg/L), but the molecules have been "environmentally distilled." Only the most indestructible, multi-ring, "diamondoid" structures remain.
    

**The Paradox:** It is often faster and easier to treat 80 mg/L of "Fresh" NAs down to 10 mg/L than it is to treat 20 mg/L of "Aged" NAs down to 2 mg/L.

#### 2. The "Diamondoid" Problem

In aged water, the molecular structure has shifted toward high **Cyclicity** (measured by the Z-series in mass spectrometry).

- **Fresh:** Mostly Z=0,−2,−4 (linear or 1–2 rings).
    
- **Aged:** Mostly Z=−8,−10,−12 (4 to 6 rings).
    
- **The Constraint:** These multi-ring structures are physically rigid. They don't fit into the active sites of common microbial enzymes, and their bonds are shielded from UV light by their own molecular geometry.
    

#### 3. Why this threatens your Engineered Wetland

If you choose "the best water" (Aged/Runoff water), your wetland faces two specific risks:

1. **Microbial "Boredom":** Because the easy food is gone, the bacteria in your wetland may not be "turned on." Without a "Starter Carbon" source, they won't produce the enzymes needed to attack the difficult aged rings.
    
2. **False Confidence:** You might see a flat line in your data for months. This isn't necessarily a failure of the wetland; it’s a reflection of the "Recalcitrant Plateau."
    

#### 4. Mitigation: "Priming the Pump"

To beat the paradox in an engineered wetland, you must use **Co-metabolism (Variable 10)** as a deliberate tool:

- **Action:** You may need to add "fresh" organic matter (like leaf litter, straw, or even a tiny amount of fresh process water) to the aged water.
    
- **Reasoning:** This provides the bacteria with a "primary substrate" to eat. As they go into a feeding frenzy on the fresh carbon, they produce the non-specific enzymes that will incidentally "chip away" at the indestructible aged rings.
