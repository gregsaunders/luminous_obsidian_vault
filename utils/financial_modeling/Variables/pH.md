The interaction between **pH** and **temperature** is one of the most significant chemical "dials" in a tailings pond. In the Athabasca oil sands, tailings are typically alkaline (high pH), often ranging between **8.0 and 9.5**.

This alkalinity is a deliberate result of the extraction process, but it drastically changes how Naphthenic Acids (NAs) behave when the weather warms up.

### 1. The pH-Temperature Interaction

The most important concept here is **speciation**. Naphthenic acids are "weak acids." Depending on the pH, they exist either as a neutral molecule or as a charged ion (surfactant).

- **At High pH (Alkaline):** NAs lose a proton and become **naphthenates**. In this state, they are highly soluble in water. They don't evaporate, and they don't easily stick to sediment.
    
- **The Temperature Connection:** As water temperature rises, the **solubility** of these naphthenates increases even further.
    
- **Toxicity Impact:** Paradoxically, while higher pH makes NAs more soluble (keeping them in the water column), it can actually **decrease** their acute toxicity to some aquatic organisms compared to acidic conditions. This is because the charged ion form (at high pH) has a harder time passing through the fatty membranes of fish gills than the neutral molecule (at low pH).
