PFAS came up in the other "Broader opportunities" document. I wanted to explore further. Interesting that it suggests a "microbial biosensor" that "lights up".

## Q) Could you theoretically develop a bio sensor for PFAS?

# Can a Biosensor Detect PFAS?

Short Answer: Yes. In principle, a biosensor could be developed to detect PFAS (Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances). Although PFAS are notoriously stable chemicals that do not break down easily, researchers are exploring how engineered proteins, enzymes, or microbial pathways might selectively bind to or react with PFAS. This binding event could then generate a measurable signal (e.g., fluorescence, electrical current, colour change), just like other biosensors.

Below is a bit more detail on the "why and how":

## 1. Understanding PFAS Challenges

PFAS have some of the strongest carbon-fluorine bonds known, making them non-reactive under normal conditions and less likely to degrade.

Low Detection Thresholds: New health guidelines often require detecting PFAS in parts per trillion (ppt) range, which is extremely low.

Complex Structures: PFAS is a broad family of thousands of substances, varying in chain length and functional groups.

These aspects make PFAS tough to detect, but they also underscore the need for fast, easy, and sensitive monitoring methods.

## 2. Potential Biosensor Approaches

### Enzyme-Based Biosensors

Scientists can attempt to isolate or engineer enzymes capable of binding or partially degrading PFAS, producing a by-product that is easier to detect.

Although naturally occurring enzymes that fully degrade PFAS have not been identified, partial binding or partial degradation may be enough for a sensing reaction.

### Receptor-Ligand Systems

Synthetic "receptors," aptamers (short DNA/RNA sequences), or antibodies could be designed or evolved in the lab to selectively bind PFAS.

Binding triggers a measurable output, like fluorescence or an electrochemical signal.

### Microbial Biosensors

Genetically engineered bacteria or yeast can be equipped with sensors that light up, change colour, or produce a measurable protein when PFAS is present.

The challenge lies in ensuring the microbe can survive in the presence of PFAS and still produce a distinct, reliable signal.

### Nanotechnology Hybrid

Nanomaterials like carbon nanotubes, graphene, or metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) functionalized with biomolecules can enhance sensitivity.

These hybrids combine biological specificity with nanomaterials' high surface area and electrical properties, enabling ultra-low-level detection.

## 3. Feasibility & Current Research

Early-Stage Research: A few research groups are investigating PFAS biosensors, but there's no dominant commercial biosensor on the market yet (unlike simpler "lab on a chip" or antibody tests for other contaminants).

Technical Proof-of-Concept: Controlled lab experiments have demonstrated that synthetic receptors (e.g., aptamers) can bind certain PFAS molecules with high specificity.

Sensitivity & Stability: The main hurdle is to achieve the ppt-level detection sensitivity while maintaining practical stability and selectivity for real-world water samples (which contain many other competing substances).

## 4. Potential Impact & Market Drivers

Regulatory Pressure: Many countries and states are dramatically lowering allowable PFAS levels in drinking water—some below 5 parts per trillion. That pushes demand for cost-effective, rapid screening.

Public Health Concerns: PFAS's nickname "forever chemicals" has caught public attention, and companies/governments are under pressure to monitor them more rigorously.

Testing Costs: Standard testing usually requires sophisticated instruments (LC-MS/MS), which are expensive. A cheap, fast biosensor could be transformative for large-scale or real-time testing.

## 5. Key Challenges to Overcome

Ensuring Ultra-High Sensitivity: PFAS guidelines are extremely low, often in the single-digit ppt range.

Selectivity Amid Complex Matrices: Real groundwater or industrial effluent contains numerous chemicals that can interfere with detection.

Durability & Repeatability: Any field-deployable biosensor must remain accurate over multiple uses or extended periods, under various pH and temperature conditions.

Scale-Up & Regulatory Acceptance: Once developed, the technology needs rigorous validation and possibly regulatory approval before industries or water utilities adopt it.

## Bottom Line

Yes, it's possible to create a biosensor for PFAS detection, building on existing knowledge of aptamers, antibodies, enzymes, or engineered microbes.

Significant R&D is still required to achieve ultra-low detection thresholds and ensure reliability in real-world conditions.

Huge Market Potential: With tightening global regulations and widespread interest in PFAS remediation, a validated PFAS biosensor could attract water utilities, industrial facilities, environmental agencies, and community organizations.

Overall, while this is not a trivial endeavor—PFAS are among the most challenging contaminants—biosensors represent a promising frontier for faster, cheaper, and more user-friendly PFAS detection.
