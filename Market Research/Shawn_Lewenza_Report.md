Introduction
Shawn Lewenza is a professor at Athabasca University, with a PhD specializing
in bacterial pathogens, bioﬁlm formation, and antibiotic resistance. He has
funding with Edmonton Unlimited to understand the opportunity with an
engineered bacterial biosensor technology to monitor water samples for the
presence of naphthenic acids generated from oilsands mining processes.
CTRS Solutions conducted a Market Assessment for Shawn Lewenza’s
patented environmental water monitoring technology. This innovative
solution offers a cost-effective alternative to traditional chemical tests and is
in the early stages of development.
CTRS performed a PESTLE analysis, market scans, and market size forecasting.
Shawn has a different consultant working on a competitive scan. CTRS
conducted four interviews with industry experts and stakeholders to provide
additional insights and shed additional insights on what we found in the
secondary research phase. The overall ﬁndings were analyzed and shared
with Shawn Lewenza.

Methodology
We followed a systematic six-step approach for this project. First, we conducted a current market analysis by reviewing existing materials, including
business plans and data from reputable sources. This step included examining reports, articles, and research focused on environmental water
monitoring and oil sands operations to establish a solid foundation for the study.
Next, we used a combination of open-source intelligence (OSINT), proprietary databases, and CTRS' technology stack to conduct secondary
research. We gathered data on regulations, industry statistics, and market drivers to highlight the scale and scope of naphthenic acid monitoring. This
research laid the groundwork for a PESTLE analysis, where we assessed political, economic, social, technological, legal, and environmental factors.
We focused on regulatory mandates, technological advancements, economic drivers, and environmental concerns in oil sands operations. Shawn
Lewenza outsourced the competitive analysis to another consulting group and while this information was shared with the CTRS team, it didn’t yield
the results anticipated due to a lack of reliable source for the information. As a result, we were unable to feed the competitive analysis into our market
assessment.
After building this foundation, we interviewed four industry experts to gain ﬁrsthand insights into testing methods, industry practices, and emerging
trends. Given what we were seeing in the research, we discussed distributing a survey, to gather a broader input from additional industry experts and
validated our ﬁndings. It was not initially part of the contract, but CTRS was open to doing this work to further the depth of research for this project.
However, Shawn Lewenza elected not to continue this survey with CTRS and instead do it himself at a later time. As such, CTRS was not able to gather
additional primary research input and data to supplement the existing research.
We then completed a market sizing exercise to deﬁne the Total Available Market (TAM), Serviceable Available Market (SAM), and Serviceable
Obtainable Market (SOM). These metrics clariﬁed the market potential for naphthenic acid monitoring technologies. These ﬁndings are very
conservative due to the limited data available and without being able to validate key inputs.
Finally, we combined and analyzed all the data. We identiﬁed information gaps and iteratively reﬁned our ﬁndings to ensure credibility and actionable
insights. This structured process enabled us to deliver our best efforts for a clear and strategic understanding of the market.

Background
What are naphthenic acids?
Naphthenic acids (NAs) are a complex mixture of cycloaliphatic carboxylic acids typically found in crude oils, oil sands, and petroleum reﬁning
by-products. They are particularly prevalent in oil sands deposits, where they form a signiﬁcant component of the "acidic" fraction of crude oil.
NAs are an important concern in oil reﬁning and processing due to their corrosive nature, particularly at high temperatures. This corrosion can
affect pipelines, reﬁneries, and equipment, leading to signiﬁcant maintenance challenges and costs.
To mitigate this, reﬁneries often employ neutralizing agents, corrosion inhibitors, or methods like hydroprocessing to reduce the naphthenic acid
content in oils.
Environmental Impact
Naphthenic acids can be toxic to aquatic life, leading to environmental concerns, especially in areas where oil sands are mined, such as Alberta,
Canada. Tailings ponds from oil sands processing can contain NAs, making proper management and treatment of these ponds critical.
These acids are persistent in the environment, making their breakdown and removal from water sources a major research focus.
Analysis of naphthenic acids
Due to their complex structure, accurately analyzing and quantifying NAs is challenging. NA is comprised of thousands of naturally occurring
compounds, which can have the same chemical formula but different structures (isomers), making analysis complex. Techniques like gas
chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) are often used to characterize them,
though no single technique can fully resolve their complexity.
These techniques can be considered the gold standard for accuracy, however, they take time and can be expensive, approximately $800-$1000
per sample. Biosensors are another method of testing naphthenic acids which is faster, cheaper and has the beneﬁt of the potential to be used
onsite. This is the market opportunity that Shawn Lewenza is exploring.

●

●

There are no current regulations requiring the testing for naphthenic acids.
There is a clear need for improved systems which present a strategic opportunity for Shawn to position his technology
as a much-needed solution, however, will require navigating the political climate in Alberta and Canada.
According to IBIS World, the environmental testing industry in the U.S. (NAICS 541380) has experienced steady growth,
with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 1.8% over the past ﬁve years, reaching an estimated $2.5 billion in
revenue in 2024.
There is still more work to be done on assessing the risk of naphthenic acids and educating the public about its level of
harm.
Public concern for the environment in Canada has declined signiﬁcantly since 2015, dropping from the second most
important issue in 2015 (11.3%) to the eighth in 2025 (4%).
Innovation is now gaining momentum in the industry. There has been a shift in patent activity reﬂecting a growing focus
on innovation, with companies exploring solutions to improve efficiency, environmental sustainability, and resource
recovery.
Imperial Oil was ﬁned $50,000 by the Alberta Energy Regulator (AER) after wastewater containing toxic tailings seeped
outside the Kearl oil sands lease boundary in 2022. The incident has sparked calls for regulatory reform and national
water guidelines to better protect communities impacted by industrial activities.

PESTLE Analysis - Political
Federal Legislation and Support Driving Water Quality and Clean Tech Innovation
●

Key federal legislation includes the Canada Water Act, which supports federal-provincial collaboration; the International
River Improvements Act, overseeing river ﬂow modiﬁcations into the U.S.; and other laws like the Fisheries Act and
Canadian Environmental Protection Act that regulate water use, pollution, and conservation. Annual reports under these
laws track water quality and environmental impacts.

●

The Government of Canada’s Bill S-5, Strengthening Environmental Protection for a Healthier Canada Act, received
Royal Assent in June, 2023, marking the ﬁrst comprehensive amendments to the Canadian Environmental Protection Act
(CEPA) in over 20 years.
○ These updates enhance protections for vulnerable populations, integrate Indigenous rights and knowledge, improve
chemical management, reduce reliance on animal testing, and formally recognize the right to a healthy environment,
strengthening Canada’s ability to address pollution and promote environmental health.

●

The Canada Water Act: The Act allows for federal-provincial agreements on water resource management, which could
support partnerships and funding opportunities for businesses working on water quality technologies that serve national
interests.

●

Governmental Support for Clean Tech: Many governments worldwide are enhancing clean technology support, especially
in sectors with high pollution risks like oil sands. This trend creates potential for partnerships and funding for monitoring
technologies (IEA - World Energy Outlook 2023).

The Premier's mandate letters outline the objectives and priorities for each minister.
The Minister of Environment and Protected Areas includes:
○ Working collaboratively with the federal government, First Nations and
industry to develop and implement an accelerated strategy for oil sands mine
water management and tailings pond reclamation
○ Reviewing Alberta’s water management strategy to increase the availability of
water and water licences to Alberta municipalities, businesses and agricultural
producers while maintaining the highest standards of water conservation and
treatment.

PESTLE Analysis - Political
Political climate
●

The economic importance of the oil sands remains a central topic in public discourse, particularly in Alberta and Canada,
amidst discussions on how Canada should respond to potential U.S. tariffs under incoming President Trump.

●

Alberta Premier Danielle Smith, known for her pro-oil sands stance, opposes leveraging U.S. dependence on Canadian oil
and gas in negotiations and has publicly challenged federal regulations aimed at reducing oil sands emissions, which
account for 31% of Canada’s GHG emissions.

●

Premier Smith’s position contrasts with federal environmental policies, many of which were implemented under Prime
Minister Justin Trudeau, who resigned in January 2025. These policies, such as the Carbon Tax and the Emissions Reduction
Plan, have been less popular in Alberta than in other provinces.

●

With federal leadership set to shift, Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre, a frontrunner in the next election, has expressed
intentions to expand pipelines and repeal environmental legislation, potentially reshaping Canada’s approach to oil sands
and emissions policies.

●

The Government of Alberta has set an aspirational goal of achieving a net-zero economy by 2050, but without a formal
plan or commitments. Their approach prioritizes hydrogen and LNG development as fuel alternatives and strongly
supports carbon capture technology as the primary strategy for reducing emissions.

Improving Oil Sands Wastewater Monitoring
●

The Alberta Energy Regulator is the responsible provincial entity for oil sands
wastewater monitoring. It collaborates and shares information with the federal
government to monitor oil sands wastewater. According to the Federal minister of
Environment, a better monitoring system is needed (CBC, March 2023). (More on
this covered in legal section.)

●

In response to seemingly slow public notiﬁcation of Imperial Oil oil sands spills in
March 2023, Danielle Smith said the province was working with the Alberta Energy
Regulator to developed more timely notiﬁcations (CTV, March 2023).

An Oil Sands Mine Water Steering Committee was launched in March 2024 to
make recommendations throughout the year and into 2025 for addressing tailings
ponds. No recommendations have yet been published. A peer reviewed research
study critical of AER’s record for monitoring oil spills was published in January
2025 and generated some limited media attention. The study found signiﬁcant
gaps and discrepancies (CBC, January 2025).
There is a clear need for improved systems which present a strategic opportunity for
Shawn to position his technology as a much-needed solution, however, will require
navigating the political climate in Alberta and Canada.

Assessing toxicity of Naphthenic Acids
●

●

●

●

●

Beginning with the 2020 reporting year, naphthenic acids and their salts, including
those in oil sands process-affected water (OSPW), have been added to CEPA’s
National Pollutant Release Inventory. In addition, research, monitoring, and
surveillance work is currently being led or funded by the Government on OSPW NAs
(Letter from Minister of Environment and Climate Change).
The letter states: OSPW NAs will be added as a priority for assessment to the
proposed Plan of Priorities being developed under section 73 of CEPA. This plan will
be published for consultation in summer 2024 and ﬁnalized by June 2025 as provided
for in subsection 73(1) of the Act. However, with the current political climate these
timelines could be impacted.
In 2024, the federal ministers of environment and health agreed to assess the
toxicity of naphthenic acids under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act
(CEPA), following a formal request by environmental groups and the Athabasca
Chipewyan First Nation (Environmental Defence, May 2024).
The decision came after environmental groups and a First Nation officially asked
earlier this year to look into the damage caused by oil sands NAs, since they are
known to have health and environmental effects.
The request was submitted in March by Ecojustice, on behalf of the Athabasca
Chipewyan First Nation, Environmental Defence and Keepers of the Water.

PESTLE Analysis - Economic
Alberta’s Oil and Gas Sees Steady Investment
●

According to the Alberta Energy Regulator, (Alberta Energy Outlook, 2024) Oil and Gas Production in Canada Alberta
remains the largest natural gas and oil producer in Canada. In 2023, Alberta produced 61% of Canada’s natural gas,
although British Columbia’s share of marketable gas production has trended up from 27% in 2013 to 37% in 2023.

●

Alberta accounted for 84% of Canada’s oil and equivalent, and 66% was marketable bitumen in 2023. In 2023, raw
crude bitumen production in Alberta was close to 3.4 million barrels per day (106 bbl/d), a 3% increase from 2022.

●

Estimated crude oil and natural gas capital expenditures fell to Cdn$15.6 billion in 2023, a 6% decrease from 2022,
driven by lower prices and less drilling activity.

●

With the expected improvement of market access, estimated oil sands capital expenditures increased from Cdn$11.9
billion in 2022 to Cdn$13.2 billion in 2023, an 11% increase from 2022. Debottlenecking and efficiency enhancements
on various projects contributed to the increased expenditure.

●

Total oil sands, crude oil, and natural gas capital expenditures are estimated to be Cdn$28.8 billion in 2023.
Investment is projected to grow steadily over the forecast period. By the end of the forecast period, the total capital
expenditures are expected to remain relatively low compared with the 2014 peak level.

Waste Treatment & Disposal Services in Canada
● The Waste Treatment and Disposal Services industry in Canada owns and
operates waste treatment or disposal facilities, including hazardous waste
treatment and disposal, and solid waste treatment and disposal
●

Waste treatment and disposal services in Canada continue to beneﬁt from
consistent consumer and industrial demand for their services. While demand
for recycling has been a long-term trend, waste production has continued to
grow.

●

The industry has been hampered by volatile crude oil prices, which, along
with the pandemic, has hindered investment in the energy sector and cut
demand from related activities.

●

Waste treatment and disposal services revenue has grown at a CAGR of 3.6%
to an estimated $5.4 billion over the past ﬁve years, including an estimated
0.5% boost in 2024.

●

Proﬁt is expected to rebound amid stabilizing operational costs and growing
adoption of automated equipment.

(CAGR) of 1.8% over the past ﬁve years, reaching an estimated $2.5 billion in revenue
in 2024.
●

The industry employs approximately 13,687 workers across 1,880 businesses.

●

Broader environmental services, including waste management and remediation,
have also grown signiﬁcantly, with the sector’s value added increasing from $47.8
billion in 2010 to $65.5 billion in 2021, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce.
This growth highlights opportunities for innovative water monitoring technologies,
such as those using engineered microbes, to address increasing demand for
sustainable and effective environmental solutions.

The environmental testing industry’s steady expansion makes it a promising market
for new technologies.

Understanding Toxicity and Health Impacts of Naphthenic Acids
●

Based on the evidence reviewed and reported by Environment and Climate Change Canada
and Health Canada (Assessment - Commercial Naphthenic Acids Group, January 2024),
there is a low risk that naphthenic acids and calcium naphthenates will harm the
environment. They are not being released in amounts or conditions that would cause
immediate or long-term damage to the environment, its ecosystems, or the life that
depends on it, according to Canadian environmental regulations (CEPA).

●

Efforts to enhance understanding of naphthenic acids in oil sands process-affected water
(OSPW) are underway through the Canada-Alberta Oil Sands Monitoring program, led by
Environment and Climate Change Canada.

●

These initiatives focus on examining the presence and effects of naphthenic acids in
tailings pond seepage. Additionally, Environment and Climate Change Canada has included
naphthenic acid fraction compounds (encompassing diverse polar organic compounds
found in bitumen and OSPW) and their salts in the National Pollutant Release Inventory,
starting with the 2020 reporting year.

Clearly, there is still more work to be done on assessing the risk of naphthenic acids and
educating the public about its level of harm.

Academic Interest in Naphthenic Acid Toxicity
●
●

●

●

●

To date, there have been 190 peer reviewed papers on
“Naphthenic Acid Toxicity”.
The academic interest in "Naphthenic Acid Toxicity" has
followed a lifecycle of growth, peaking, and then
stabilizing. The initial interest in the topic began in earnest
in 2005, and the number of publications steadily increased
from two to ten by 2011.
Peak interest in 2013 was attributed to increased concern,
breakthroughs in research methods, and substantial
funding and regulatory interest.
The post-peak decline from 2014 to 2024 was followed by
a stabilization at 10-11 papers per year, indicating a plateau
of research interest.
The current levels point to ongoing monitoring and
reﬁnement rather than breakthrough discoveries.

Public Concern for the Environment
●

Public concern for the environment in Canada has declined signiﬁcantly since 2015, dropping from
the second most important issue in 2015 (11.3%) to the eighth in 2025 (4%), as economic
challenges like inﬂation, housing, and debt have taken priority. In Alberta, where energy and
cost-of-living concerns are long standing, skepticism toward federal emissions policies has
intensiﬁed amidst growing economic pressures.

Addressing Toxicity and Health Impacts of Naphthenic Acids in Oil Sands
●

First Nations and environmental groups in Alberta urged Ottawa to classify naphthenic acids from
oil sands tailings as toxic under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act (CEPA), (Alberta Oil
Sand Pollution Impacts on Local Indigenous Communities and Cooperation with Indigenous
Peoples, 2024).

●

Empowering First Nations with greater control over water resources is a fundamental step toward
reconciliation, aligns with the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, and is essential
for permanently resolving drinking water advisories in First Nations communities.

Some interest groups, especially Indigenous communities, are motivated to speak up and advocate for
better water management in tailing ponds.

Addressing Toxicity and Health Impacts of Naphthenic Acids in Oil Sands
●

Through a formal request, ﬁled by Ecojustice on behalf of the Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation and others, aims to
impose stricter regulations and monitoring, especially with plans to release treated tailings water into the
Athabasca River (National Observer, March 2024).

●

While CEPA modernization enables such requests, experts caution that regulatory actions may only mandate
self-monitoring rather than robust environmental safeguards.

●

The agreement by the health and environmental ministers to assess the toxicity of naphthenic acids marks the
second successful use of CEPA's 2023 amendment allowing public requests for prioritizing hazardous substances.
This reﬂects growing attention to the environmental and health impacts of oil sands tailings ponds.

●

In August 2024, the Minister of Environment and Climate Change Canada, Minister Guilbeault, announced that the
Government of Canada is going to make available nearly $12 million over 10 years for the Fort Chipewyan Health
Study. The community-led health study, with the Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation, the Mikisew Cree First Nation
and the Fort Chipewyan Métis Nation, will examine the impacts of the oil sands on community members’ health.

PESTLE Analysis - Technology
Innovation in oil sands industry
●

Oil sands companies have traditionally been criticized for relying on decades-old extraction
methods, but innovation is now gaining momentum in the industry. Over the past decade, energy
companies have increasingly sought patents for technological advancements.

●

The report by Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada, Patent Landscape Report
(2017), highlights that patenting activity in the oil and gas sector grew by 188% between 2000
and 2012, with approximately 4,000 published patent families worldwide, including 100 from
Canadian applicants. Leading Canadian patent ﬁlers, such as Trican Well Service, Envirollea, and
GASFRAC, are based in Calgary, Alberta. It appears that patents related to environmental
protection, including water monitoring, remain underdeveloped. Although the report offers
valuable insights, it is dated, and ﬁnding more recent information has been challenging.

●

Examples include:
○ Suncor: Patents for conveyor belts, hand railings, and solvents for extracting bitumen.
○ Imperial Oil: Patents for steel wire rope lubricants, heat and water recovery methods, and
biological detoxiﬁcation of oil sands effluent.
○ Cenovus Energy: Scientists are working on 50 projects but remain cautious about patenting
due to its high costs and lengthy processes.

This shift in patent activity reﬂects a growing focus on innovation, with companies exploring solutions
to improve efficiency, environmental sustainability, and resource recovery.

Biosensors
●
●

●

●

The concept of biosensors was ﬁrst introduced in the 1960s.
The use of biosensors in water quality monitoring offers a promising solution for ensuring safe and clean water resources.
○ Rapid and Accurate Detection: Biosensors can quickly and accurately detect various pollutants in water, enabling
real-time monitoring and faster response to contamination events.
○ High Sensitivity and Speciﬁcity: Biosensors offer high sensitivity and speciﬁcity, allowing for the detection of even
trace amounts of speciﬁc pollutants.
○ Cost-Effectiveness: Compared to traditional physical instruments, biosensors can be more cost-effective in the long
run due to their reusability and potential for miniaturization.
○ Portability: Biosensors can be made portable, enabling on-site and in-situ monitoring of water quality.
○ Versatility: Biosensors can be designed to detect a wide range of pollutants, including BOD, heavy metals, toxins, and
microorganisms.
Concerns over sustainability have been raised, since spreading biosensors in bodies of water could have unknown effects
on ecosystems. To solve this, scientists propose a two-step approach. First, by using less precise methods to detect if the
water shows signs of contamination, then, on an as-needed basis, deploy biosensors to more accurately pinpoint the type
or source of contamination.
Monitoring can inﬂuence decision-making based on real-time data so that producers can beneﬁt from a more precise route
to market. One of the challenges for commercial deployment of this technology is making it more robust, with affordable
sensor technologies and understanding the effects of biosensors on ecosystems.

●

Imperial Oil was ﬁned $50,000 by the Alberta Energy Regulator (AER) after
wastewater containing toxic tailings seeped outside the Kearl oil sands lease
boundary in 2022.
It was revealed that tailings had been seeping for nine months before a 5.3
million-litre spill in February 2023 brought the issue to public attention.
The ﬁne, the maximum allowed under Alberta law, also required mitigation
plans, lesson sharing, and research into environmental impacts. However,
Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation (ACFN) Chief Allan Adam criticized the
penalty as inadequate, calling it a "weak response" to signiﬁcant environmental
harm affecting downstream communities like Fort Chipewyan.
The incident has sparked calls for regulatory reform and national water
guidelines to better protect communities impacted by industrial activities. This
case highlights broader frustrations with inadequate regulatory systems,
insufficient penalties, and a lack of transparency and accountability from the
Alberta government and AER.

Naphthenic Acids Testing
Mass spectrometry, ﬁeld test kits, and biosensors
●

●

●

●
●

Mass spectrometry is considered the most precise method, but it is expensive, requires
skilled personnel, and high-resolution equipment. The lab conducting this testing is unique in
that they have the skilled personnel to operate the equipment.
Field test kits offer a more convenient and cost-effective way to get quick estimates of
naphthenic acid levels on-site.
Biosensors are an emerging technology that uses microbes or enzymes to react with
pollutants and produce a measurable signal. They are considered a promising technology but
require further development and validation.
The demand for testing is inﬂuenced by government regulations and industry practices.
The cost of testing varies depending on the method used. FTRR (infrared) tests cost about
$20-$40 per sample, while government labs charge $120 for routine samples, and up to $180
for legal samples in emergency situations. Private labs may charge around $200 per sample.

“People need to be
skilled in mass spec.
Most of the people
are going to
pharmaceutical
because they pay
more.”

Interviewee

Key takeaway: Biosensors have their advantages but mass spectrometry is considered the most
precise, while it is the most expensive.

Regulations
Regulations and industry practices

“This is a good long term
project. It could be regulated
in 15 years, maybe more. We
will see downsizing [in the
government] and scientists
will lose their jobs so it
could be hard to change
regulations. But we need
someone to lead and get
indigenous on board.”
-

Interviewee

●

Government regulations play a signiﬁcant role in driving testing demand. However, there
are currently no government regulations on NAs.

●

There is a disconnect between research and industry regarding acceptable testing
standards.

●

Those people who were interviewed were not in the oil and gas industry, however, three
out of the four people speculated that oil and gas companies would not be motivated to
go beyond the minimum requirements if government regulations are not strict and with
no current regulations, it is unlikely they would take the initiative to test for NAs.

●

One person had a much more optimistic view sharing that there is a steering committee
with representatives from the oil sands and government and Indigenous where they are
looking for new technologies, even if they aren’t regulated yet, as it can serve them well
to be proactive before regulations are formed. This gives industry the opportunity to
inform the regulations.

Key takeaway: Without government regulations, the oil and gas industry lacks motivation to
prioritize NA testing, resulting in a signiﬁcant gap between research advancements and
industry adoption.

Barriers to Progress
Gaps in Resources, Regulations, and Transparency
●

The lack of skilled personnel and resources is a challenge for research and development.

●

It was suggested that there is a need for LC50 testing to determine the toxicity of tailings
ponds but this has not been done, in part because research scientists do not agree with the
methods of the lab. The challenge with not determining the toxicity of the tailing ponds is
there is no baseline measurement of naphthenic acids or current level of toxicity.

●

There is a pessimism about this business opportunity, for different reasons based on who
was speaking. A few people believe was that without regulations around NAs, there is very
limited opportunity.

●

There is a concern that the oil sands area is a "wild expense" under joint jurisdiction of
provincial, federal and municipal governments.

●

The lack of NA regulations means that oil companies are not required to test, and even if they
do, they are not obligated to report.

Key takeaway: The lack of skilled personnel, baseline toxicity data, and clear regulations creates
signiﬁcant barriers to advancing NA monitoring, with limited transparency from the oil and gas
industry further compounding the challenge.

“I don't think we're there
yet, even in terms of
science on that side of it.”
-

Interviewee

“We don’t have very good
markers or capabilities to
say this NA came from X
or Y. It’s because there are
1000s of complexes, they
are trying to seeing what
is toxic or not toxic.”

Opportunity
Other key topics for consideration
● There is an interest in developing sensor technologies that can provide more timely information,
even if it's just presence/absence data. There is a strong community need for timely testing of water
quality. Real-time data that is accessible to the community can be very impactful, eg. Indigenous
communities. Real-time data from sensors could be a real advantage for monitoring programs.
●

Biosensor technology can be taken into the ﬁeld and used to conduct more tests at a lower cost.
Smart monitoring networks with automated sensors could create efficiencies in cost and data
return. Using biosensors for initial assessment can help identify "hot spots" where further testing
with mass spectrometry is needed, saving time and money.

●

Leverage the role that Pathways Alliance plays in water monitoring for the oil sands, especially
through a platform called “ETAP” which is an intake process for evaluating new technologies within
water monitoring.

●

The market for sensor technologies is potentially broad, not just within Canada but globally.

●

There is a need for monitoring in areas where there are spills and leaks.

Key takeaway: Real-time, cost-effective biosensor technologies present a signiﬁcant opportunity to
address the strong community need for timely water quality data, enabling targeted testing and improving
monitoring efficiency on both local and global scales.

“If you talk to the
Indigenous
communities in these
areas, they want to
know what's in the
water. Whether
there’s regulations or
not. ”

What is needed for this opportunity
The essentials for exploring this opportunity
●

Government funding and support are crucial for advancing research and innovation in this
area.

●

Government regulations will need to change in order to drive testing demand.

●

Protests and public awareness might drive action and testing requirements around NA
contamination

●

The focus must be on identifying the customers who will pay for NA testing.

“This is the same
idea as Erin
Brockovich. We need
protests to drive
public awareness of
the dangers [of NAs]
in the water.”
-

Key takeaway: Advancing NA testing requires collaborative efforts across stakeholders to drive
political will for emphasizing the importance of testing NAs, and a clear focus on identifying paying
customers to drive innovation and adoption.

What is a Channel Partner?
CHANNEL PARTNERS OVERVIEW
A channel partner is an organization or entity that collaborates with a
business to help promote, sell, or distribute its products or services to end
users.
Unlike direct sales, channel partners act as intermediaries, leveraging their
established networks, expertise, or inﬂuence to connect a company with its
target audience. They can provide credibility, increase market reach, and reduce
the time and resources needed to engage potential customers.
For example, a channel partner in the environmental sector might introduce
innovative technologies to their networks or integrate them into existing
workﬂows, making it easier for businesses to gain traction.
Channel partnerships are particularly effective because they allow a
company to tap into an established entity's reputation and relationships,
facilitating market entry and adoption of the technology.

Water Monitoring Channel Partners
Why the Alberta Energy Regulator (AER) Could Be a Strong Channel Partner
The AER is responsible for monitoring oil sands wastewater and works closely with both provincial and federal
governments, giving it signiﬁcant inﬂuence over industry practices. By partnering with the AER, Shawn could gain
access to critical stakeholders in the oil sands industry and ensure his technology is considered as part of
regulatory-driven monitoring enhancements.
To build a relationship with the AER, Shawn could approach the AER by demonstrating how his technology aligns
with their mandate to ensure environmental safety and compliance.
Why the Oil Sands Mine Water Steering Committee Could Be a Strong Channel Partner
The Oil Sands Mine Water Steering Committee was launched to make recommendations on tailings pond
management, making it a key inﬂuencer in shaping future water monitoring requirements. As the committee works
on addressing gaps and forming recommendations, it creates a valuable opportunity for Shawn to position his
technology as a solution to one of the industry’s most pressing challenges.
To connect with the committee, Shawn should monitor its progress and attend relevant meetings or workshops
where members may be present. Establishing relationships with committee members early in their deliberations
could ensure Shawn’s technology is considered as part of any recommendations.

Indigenous Communities Channel Partners
Why Indigenous Communities Could Be a Good Channel Partner
Indigenous communities, particularly those downstream of oil
sands operations, are deeply invested in ensuring water quality
due to direct impacts on health and the environment. Many
communities are actively advocating for stricter monitoring and
better regulatory enforcement.
Shawn could partner with Indigenous leadership, such as the
Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation or Mikisew Cree First Nation, to
offer the technology as a tool for community-led monitoring.
These partnerships could strengthen advocacy efforts and create
demand from regulatory bodies and industry to adopt Shawn’s
technology.

Market Assessment

Industry Association Channel Partners
Why Industry Associations Could Be a Good Channel Partner
Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP) and Pathways Alliance (formerly COSIA) are inﬂuential
organizations that represent the oil and gas industry in Canada, focusing on environmental innovation and
sustainability in oil sands operations.
The challenge with this audience is that the associations represent the interests of businesses and they may not be
open to conversation until government changes regulations or guidelines about NA. The one warm opportunity that
Shawn has here is to leverage the contact made by CTRS with Pathways Alliance who is open to talking with Shawn
about his technology. There may be an opportunity to present Shawn’s technology through the “ETAP” platform which
is an evaluation process of new technologies that can help with water monitoring.
To build a relationship with CAPP or Pathways Alliance, Shawn should showcase how his biosensors align with their
goals in reducing environmental risks associated with tailings ponds. Participating in initiatives, such as the oil sands
monitoring program, of which Pathways Alliance is a key stakeholder, could help Shawn position himself in front of the
right people.
