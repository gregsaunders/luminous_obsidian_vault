Key Notes of Discussions 30

1. What are NAFCs and why do we care about them? 31

- **Definition**: "Naphthenic acids (NAs) are a complex class of thousands of naturally occurring aliphatic and alicyclic carboxylic acids found in oil sands bitumen and in wastewater generated from bitumen processing." (Kovalchik et al. 2017) 32.
    
- **Classic NAs vs NAs in OSPW**:
    
    - **IUPAC definition (classic NAs)**: Chiefly monocarboxylic, derived from naphthenes. Formula $C_nH_{2n+z}O_2$ where $n$ is carbon number and $Z$ is hydrogen deficiency33.
        
    - **NAs in OSPW**: Over 50% of compounds in OSPW extracts are not classic NAs34. Formulas include $C_nH_{2n+z}O_x$ where $x=2-7$35.
        
    - **Components**: Contain other heteroatoms like sulfur and nitrogen; aromatic acids have also been detected36.
        
    - **Characteristics**: OSPW NAs are chemically stable and non-volatile37.
        
    - **Suggested definition**: Oil sands tailings water acid-extractable organics38.
        

2. What are the methods used to measure NAFCs 39

- **Common Methods**: UPLC-TOF-MS, HPLC-QqQ-MS, GC-Orbitrap-MS, UPLC-TWIM-TOF-MS, GCxGC-TOF-MS, FT-ICR MS, GC-EIMS, FTIR, Microchip electrophoresis, Triple quadruple MS, HPLC-Orbitrap MS40.
    
- **Calibration Standards**:
    
    - **Merichem NA**: Derived from refinery-based NAs; only available through ECCC. Composition is unknown and varies by batch41414141.
        
    - **Sigma-Aldrich NA mix**: Composed primarily of fatty acids; water solubility is a challenge42424242.
        
    - **Acros NA**: Currently used by some labs including BV43434343.
        
    - **Fluka NA**: Discontinued44.
        

3. Sample preparation - importance and key notes 45

- **Criticality**: Menti results indicate that extraction and separation methods are the most critical steps for reliable results46.
    
- **Extraction Comparison**:
    

|**ASPECT**|**SPE**|**LLE**|
|---|---|---|
|**Solvent Use**|Ethanol, methanol, PEG-ethanol; compatible with LC-MS and bioassays 49494949|DCM (toxic, less compatible with downstream biological testing) 50505050|
|**Repeatability**|High, especially with automated systems 51|Low 52|
|**Setup Cost**|High upfront (~$88K-$100K) 53|Low; basic glassware 54|
|**Automation**|Possible (e.g., Dionex Autotrace) 55|Rare; mostly manual 56|
|**Selectivity**|Sorbent-dependent; can isolate specific fractions 57|Less selective; depends on solvent polarity 58|

- **Filtration vs. Centrifugation**:
    

|**ASPECT**|**FILTRATION**|**CENTRIFUGATION**|
|---|---|---|
|**Analyte Loss**|Material can adsorb analytes like NAs 59|Lower, but NAs may adsorb to sediment particles 60|
|**Consistency**|Varies with turbidity and filter choice 61|More consistent if RCF and time are standardized 62|
|**Best Use Case**|Defining dissolved fraction/removing emulsions 63|Minimizing analyte loss and ensuring reproducibility 64|

4. Characterization Techniques: Mass Spec Methods vs. FTIR 65

|**ASPECT**|**MASS SPEC**|**FTIR**|
|---|---|---|
|**Resolution**|High resolution; detailed profiling but not exact structures 66|Measures all $C=O$ bonds; general signal, less specific 67|
|**Routine Use**|Not ideal due to cost and complexity 68|More feasible for routine screening 69|
|**Standardization**|Difficult due to instrument variability 70|Easier to standardize, but affected by composition 71|
|**Inter-lab Consistency**|Poor without standardization 72|Better consistency if sample prep is controlled 73|
|**Use Case**|Research, problem investigation 74|Routine monitoring and performance testing 75|

Key Takeaways and Next Steps 76

- **Scalability**: High-throughput screening methods are essential for processing thousands of annual samples77.
    
- **Standardization**: Consistency across labs is critical78. The first step is obtaining standard samples, ideally OSPW-derived extracts79.
    
- **Tiered Monitoring**: Use simple, fast methods for routine detection and advanced techniques for anomalies80.
    
- **Research Needs**: High-resolution mass spec data is required to understand toxicity mechanisms and water treatment effectiveness81.
