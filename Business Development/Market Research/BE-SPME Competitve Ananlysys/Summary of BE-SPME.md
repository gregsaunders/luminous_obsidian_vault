# Summary of BE-SPME Technology for Naphthenic Acid Monitoring in Oil Sands

## What is BE-SPME?

Bio-compatible Solid Phase Microextraction (BE-SPME) is an advanced sample preparation technology designed for the detection and analysis of naphthenic acids (NAs) in Oil Sands Process-affected Water (OSPW). BE-SPME builds upon standard Solid Phase Microextraction (SPME) - a solvent-free technique that integrates sampling, extraction, and concentration of analytes into a single step using a small fused-silica fiber coated with a selective sorbent material. The "bio-compatible" designation means the materials are specifically engineered to resist or minimize adverse interactions with complex matrix components found in challenging samples like OSPW.

## Relationship to NA Monitoring in Oil Sands Tailings Ponds

Naphthenic acids are a primary contributor to the toxicity of OSPW, making their monitoring critical for environmental management. These organic acids are naturally present in bitumen but become significantly concentrated in the aqueous phase during oil sands mining operations, ending up in tailings ponds that exceed 1.39 billion cubic meters and cover over 300 square kilometers.

BE-SPME offers potential application in two main areas of NA monitoring:

1. Environmental monitoring - including in-situ field screening, time-weighted average monitoring, leak detection, compliance monitoring, and process monitoring
2. Toxicity testing - most notably through direct bioavailability measurement within test systems

## Effectiveness and Advantages

Key potential advantages of BE-SPME include:

1. Enhanced sensitivity through preconcentration of analytes
2. Reduced sample handling and solvent consumption compared to traditional methods
3. Potential for in-situ and field deployment with minimal sample perturbation
4. Direct measurement of bioavailable fraction (key for toxicity assessment)
5. Potential cost-effectiveness by simplifying sample preparation and enabling field analysis

## Disadvantages and Limitations

Despite its potential, BE-SPME faces significant challenges:

1. Selectivity issues for complex NA mixtures - designing a fiber coating that can efficiently extract thousands of NA isomers and homologues is extremely difficult
2. Matrix effects from OSPW - high concentrations of salts, bitumen, surfactants, particles, and other compounds can cause fouling, competitive adsorption, and altered partitioning
3. Quantification and calibration difficulties - establishing consistent equilibrium conditions in variable field environments is challenging
4. Low Technology Readiness Level (TRL) - estimated at TRL 4-6, meaning extensive validation is still needed

## Costs and Scalability

The report does not provide specific cost figures but discusses cost considerations:

BE-SPME could potentially offer lower analytical costs per sample compared to traditional laboratory methods by reducing solvent usage, simplifying sample preparation, and enabling field analysis. However, this depends on factors like:

- Fiber cost and reusability
- The cost of coupled analytical instruments
- Fiber durability and lifespan in harsh OSPW conditions

Regarding scalability to the massive oil sands footprint:

BE-SPME is rated as having "Moderate to High" scalability compared to traditional lab methods (Low) and biosensors (High). The technology's potential for field deployment supports scalability, but practical implementation for widespread monitoring would require addressing logistical challenges such as designing robust deployment devices, methods for controlling exposure time, secure fiber retrieval systems, and strategies for either on-site analysis or proper preservation and transport.

## Current Status and Recommendations

BE-SPME for NA monitoring is currently at a low-to-mid Technology Readiness Level (TRL 4-6) and is not yet ready for widespread operational deployment. The report recommends:

1. Focused fiber development - prioritizing research on coating technology for selectivity and anti-fouling properties
2. Rigorous method validation using authentic OSPW samples
3. Strategic pilot studies in relevant oil sands environments
4. Leveraging the unique capabilities for toxicity application
5. Proactive regulatory engagement with the Alberta Energy Regulator

BE-SPME shows promise, particularly for bioavailability assessment, but requires further research and validation before it can be effectively deployed at scale across the oil sands region.
