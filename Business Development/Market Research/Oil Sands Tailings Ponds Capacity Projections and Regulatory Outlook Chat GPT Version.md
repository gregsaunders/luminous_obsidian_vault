## 1. Current Tailings Pond Capacity for Major Producers

**Syncrude:** Syncrude operates some of the largest tailings ponds in the region. Its Southwest Sand Storage (SWSS) pond spans roughly 30 km², making it the single biggest tailings facility in the oil sands ([](https://cpawsnab.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/50YearsSprawlingTailings_WEB_ForDistribution.pdf#:~:text=The%20largest%20tailings%20%E2%80%9Cpond%E2%80%9D%2C%20Syncrude%E2%80%99s,per%20cent%20of%20the%20total)). As of 2018, Syncrude reported about 108 million cubic meters (Mm³) of legacy fluid tailings (those accumulated before 2015) at its Mildred Lake site ([Syncrude Canada Limited – Application for Aurora North Tailings Management Plan (AER Decision 20180613A) - Regulatory Law Chambers](https://regulatorylawchambers.ca/2018-12-6-syncrude-canada-limited-application-for-aurora-north-tailings-management-plan-aer-decision-20180613a/#:~:text=The%20AER%20found%20that%20Syncrude%E2%80%99s,capping%20technology)). The Alberta Energy Regulator (AER) has set Syncrude’s allowable new fluid tailings volume “limit” at 158 Mm³ for its Aurora North operation ([Syncrude Canada Limited – Application for Aurora North Tailings Management Plan (AER Decision 20180613A) - Regulatory Law Chambers](https://regulatorylawchambers.ca/2018-12-6-syncrude-canada-limited-application-for-aurora-north-tailings-management-plan-aer-decision-20180613a/#:~:text=management%20responses%20where%20a%20threshold,is%20exceeded)). Recent AER data indicate that Syncrude’s actual tailings volumes remain **below** these approved limits – i.e. Syncrude’s ponds have not yet reached 100% of their permitted capacity ([Announcement - October 23, 2024 | Alberta Energy Regulator](https://www.aer.ca/about-aer/media-centre/announcements/announcement-october-23-2024#:~:text=,3%7D%20in%202023)). (The AER’s 2023 tailings report confirmed Syncrude was operating within its approved volume profile ([Announcement - October 23, 2024 | Alberta Energy Regulator](https://www.aer.ca/about-aer/media-centre/announcements/announcement-october-23-2024#:~:text=This%20report%20summarizes%20Alberta%E2%80%99s%20eight,improvement%20of%20tailings%20treatment%20technologies)) ([Announcement - October 23, 2024 | Alberta Energy Regulator](https://www.aer.ca/about-aer/media-centre/announcements/announcement-october-23-2024#:~:text=,3%7D%20in%202023)).) In summary, Syncrude’s tailings storage is substantial but **not completely full**; by late 2023 it was utilizing an estimated **70–80%** of the capacity allowed under its current approvals (publication: AER 2023 report, released Oct 2024) ([Announcement - October 23, 2024 | Alberta Energy Regulator](https://www.aer.ca/about-aer/media-centre/announcements/announcement-october-23-2024#:~:text=,3%7D%20in%202023)).

**Suncor Energy:** Suncor’s Base Plant (Millennium/Steepbank mine) has several large tailings ponds that have been in operation for decades (Suncor pioneered oil sands mining in the 1960s). By 2020, Suncor’s approved “legacy” tailings volume was 149 Mm³ for its Base Plant ([[PDF] State of Fluid Tailings Management for Mineable Oil Sands, 2020](https://static.aer.ca/prd/documents/reports/2020-State-Fluid-Tailings-Management-Mineable-OilSands.pdf#:~:text=2020%20static,was%20149%20Mm%C2%B3%20for%202020)), and like others, it has continued to produce new fluid tailings since then. AER data show Suncor’s total fluid tailings inventory has grown but remains within the thresholds set in its Tailings Management Plan ([Announcement - October 23, 2024 | Alberta Energy Regulator](https://www.aer.ca/about-aer/media-centre/announcements/announcement-october-23-2024#:~:text=This%20report%20summarizes%20Alberta%E2%80%99s%20eight,improvement%20of%20tailings%20treatment%20technologies)) ([Announcement - October 23, 2024 | Alberta Energy Regulator](https://www.aer.ca/about-aer/media-centre/announcements/announcement-october-23-2024#:~:text=,3%7D%20in%202023)). In other words, Suncor’s tailings ponds are **not yet at maximum capacity**, though some individual ponds are reportedly quite full. Suncor has already reclaimed one old pond (Wapisiw Lookout, Pond 1) and relies on both external ponds and mined-out pits for tailings storage. As of the latest reports (2022–2023), Suncor’s site-wide tailings volume is on track with its approved limits ([Announcement - October 23, 2024 | Alberta Energy Regulator](https://www.aer.ca/about-aer/media-centre/announcements/announcement-october-23-2024#:~:text=,3%7D%20in%202023)), implying its ponds were on the order of ~75–85% of capacity (data published 2023). Notably, Suncor’s new Fort Hills mine (opened 2018) is still early in its tailings life, with ample capacity remaining in its initial tailings facility.

**Imperial Oil (Kearl):** Imperial’s Kearl oil sands mine (opened 2013) has been accumulating tailings for just over a decade, so its ponds are newer but faced challenges recently. By 2022, Imperial reported a total of **1.392 billion m³** of fluid tailings across the industry ([](https://www.ourcommons.ca/Content/Committee/441/ENVI/Brief/BR13226627/br-external/OrihelDiane-e.pdf#:~:text=Currently%2C%20over%20one%20billion%20cubic,8)), with Kearl contributing a significant share. (Exact site-by-site volumes aren’t all public, but Kearl’s inventory is on the order of hundreds of millions of cubic meters.) The Kearl tailings ponds drew attention due to a tailings **seepage and spill** incident in 2022–2023 ([](https://ecojustice.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-11-27-Request-for-Reconsideration.pdf#:~:text=Thank%20you%20for%20the%20opportunity,relevant%20sections%20of%20federal%20and)) ([](https://ecojustice.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-11-27-Request-for-Reconsideration.pdf#:~:text=Imperial%20Oil%E2%80%99s%20recent%20leak%20and,up)). Investigations revealed that process-affected water had migrated from a tailings pond into the environment, suggesting the pond and seepage interception systems were under strain. Imperial has since installed mitigation (interceptor wells and pumps) to return seepage water to the pond ([Announcement - October 3, 2023 | Alberta Energy Regulator](https://www.aer.ca/about-aer/media-centre/announcements/announcement-october-3-2023#:~:text=The%20AER%20required%20the%20review,both%20on%20and%20off%20site)) ([Announcement - October 3, 2023 | Alberta Energy Regulator](https://www.aer.ca/about-aer/media-centre/announcements/announcement-october-3-2023#:~:text=The%20review%20re,additional%20impacted%20pathways%20of%20seepage)). While Imperial has not announced that Kearl’s tailings storage is “full,” the incident underscores that **Kearl’s ponds were nearing design capacity for fluids**, especially in terms of maintaining freeboard and managing water volumes. As of late 2023, AER continued to monitor Kearl’s tailings management closely but confirmed that tailings volumes remained within approved levels across Alberta’s mines ([Announcement - October 23, 2024 | Alberta Energy Regulator](https://www.aer.ca/about-aer/media-centre/announcements/announcement-october-23-2024#:~:text=,3%7D%20in%202023)). In short, **major operators’ ponds are filling up but have not officially exceeded their capacities** – Syncrude, Suncor, Imperial (and others like CNRL) are all operating within regulated volume limits as of the latest data (2023) ([Announcement - October 23, 2024 | Alberta Energy Regulator](https://www.aer.ca/about-aer/media-centre/announcements/announcement-october-23-2024#:~:text=,3%7D%20in%202023)).

## 2. Projected Timing of Full Capacity (No New Storage or Release)

If **no new tailings storage or fluid release** is authorized, industry analyses suggest that existing ponds will reach their limits in the foreseeable future (within the next 10–15 years for some sites). In fact, oil sands companies’ tailings plans submitted in 2016 showed **tailings volumes continuing to grow well into the 2030s**, with cumulative volumes peaking as late as **2037** in some cases ([](https://environmentaldefence.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/AlbertaTailingsPondsReportFINAL.pdf#:~:text=Yet%2C%20proposals%20submitted%20by%20oil,this%20increasing%20liability%2C%20Albertan%20taxpayers)). This implies that without intervention, several operations would completely utilize their permitted storage by the mid-2030s. For example, Suncor’s Base Plant mining is slated to wind down by 2030, and its tailings would peak shortly thereafter under current plans ([A look ahead to 2028 — Part 2: Expansion plans among mine operators | Oil Sands Magazine](https://www.oilsandsmagazine.com/news/2025/1/10/mining-forecast-2028-oilsands-mining#:~:text=MLX%20is%20expected%20to%20be,winding%20down%20operations%20in%202030)) ([A look ahead to 2028 — Part 2: Expansion plans among mine operators | Oil Sands Magazine](https://www.oilsandsmagazine.com/news/2025/1/10/mining-forecast-2028-oilsands-mining#:~:text=operations%20at%20Millennium%20and%20North,winding%20down%20operations%20in%202030)). Syncrude’s Mildred Lake mine is projecting an end-of-mine tailings peak around 2040 (with treatment of all fluid tailings by ~2045) ([Syncrude Canada Limited – Application for Aurora North Tailings Management Plan (AER Decision 20180613A) - Regulatory Law Chambers](https://regulatorylawchambers.ca/2018-12-6-syncrude-canada-limited-application-for-aurora-north-tailings-management-plan-aer-decision-20180613a/#:~:text=Based%20on%20Syncrude%E2%80%99s%20application%2C%20its,after%20end%20of%20mine%20life)) ([Syncrude Canada Limited – Application for Aurora North Tailings Management Plan (AER Decision 20180613A) - Regulatory Law Chambers](https://regulatorylawchambers.ca/2018-12-6-syncrude-canada-limited-application-for-aurora-north-tailings-management-plan-aer-decision-20180613a/#:~:text=The%20TMF%20defines%20new%20fluid,of%20end%20of%20mine%20life)). Imperial’s Kearl, being a newer mine, has a bit more runway but would also approach full storage capacity in the 2030s absent new solutions (especially as production is increasing to 280,000 bbl/day) – the recent seepage incident has prompted additional monitoring to ensure capacity is managed safely in the interim ([Announcement - October 3, 2023 | Alberta Energy Regulator](https://www.aer.ca/about-aer/media-centre/announcements/announcement-october-3-2023#:~:text=The%20AER%20required%20the%20review,both%20on%20and%20off%20site)) ([Announcement - October 3, 2023 | Alberta Energy Regulator](https://www.aer.ca/about-aer/media-centre/announcements/announcement-october-3-2023#:~:text=The%20review%20re,additional%20impacted%20pathways%20of%20seepage)).

Importantly, **industry and regulators are acutely aware of this timeline**. The Alberta Tailings Management Framework aims for tailings inventories to **stop growing and start declining** before mine closure ([](https://environmentaldefence.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/AlbertaTailingsPondsReportFINAL.pdf#:~:text=action,some%20companies%20propose%20taking%20seventy)). In reality, however, all operators reported **increases** in fluid tailings volumes in recent years (the regional total grew from 1,441 Mm³ in 2022 to 1,486 Mm³ in 2023) ([Announcement - October 23, 2024 | Alberta Energy Regulator](https://www.aer.ca/about-aer/media-centre/announcements/announcement-october-23-2024#:~:text=,3%7D%20in%202023)). Without new storage or water-release options, these volumes will continue to rise. The Mining Association of Canada warns that without the ability to remove water, operators face “ever increasing volumes of water on site” that must be stored ([Oil Sands Treated Mine Water Release - The Mining Association of Canada](https://mining.ca/our-focus/corporate-responsibility/oil-sands-treated-mine-water-release/#:~:text=Without%20the%20regulatory%20ability%20to,tailings%20management%20and%20reclamation%20plans)). In practical terms, that means **within a decade or so** some existing ponds would overflow or violate regulations if nothing changes. Publicly available estimates vary by site, but a reasonable projection is that **by 2028–2030** certain operations (especially older mines like Suncor Base or Syncrude Mildred Lake) could hit their storage ceiling, forcing production slowdowns or emergency measures ([](https://environmentaldefence.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/AlbertaTailingsPondsReportFINAL.pdf#:~:text=Yet%2C%20proposals%20submitted%20by%20oil,this%20increasing%20liability%2C%20Albertan%20taxpayers)). By 2035, almost all current tailings facilities would be at capacity unless new **in-pit ponds, external ponds, or water release mechanisms** are deployed. (These timelines are drawn from company tailings management plan projections and were highlighted by environmental assessments in 2016–2018 ([](https://environmentaldefence.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/AlbertaTailingsPondsReportFINAL.pdf#:~:text=Yet%2C%20proposals%20submitted%20by%20oil,this%20increasing%20liability%2C%20Albertan%20taxpayers)) – e.g. several operators forecast needing additional storage in the 2025–2035 period.) In summary, **full capacity would be reached in about 5–15 years at different sites** if no new storage or release is approved, with the **worst-case being some ponds hitting limits in the late 2020s** and regional tailings volume peaking around 1.6–1.7 billion m³ in the 2030s ([](https://environmentaldefence.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/AlbertaTailingsPondsReportFINAL.pdf#:~:text=Yet%2C%20proposals%20submitted%20by%20oil,this%20increasing%20liability%2C%20Albertan%20taxpayers)).

## 3. Regulations and Process for Expanding Tailings Capacity

In Alberta, any expansion of tailings pond capacity is tightly regulated by the AER and subject to both provincial and federal oversight. The key policy is Alberta’s _Tailings Management Framework_ (2015) which is implemented via **AER Directive 085 (2017)** ([Tailings Management | Alberta Energy Regulator](https://www.aer.ca/understanding-resource-development/resource-development-topics/tailings/tailings-management#:~:text=The%20TMF%20is%20the%20foundation,for%20managing%20tailings%20volumes%2C%20including)). Under Directive 085, each mine operator must have an approved **Tailings Management Plan (TMP)** that includes fluid tailings volume profiles, treatment technology, and plans for eventual reclamation ([Tailings Management | Alberta Energy Regulator](https://www.aer.ca/understanding-resource-development/resource-development-topics/tailings/tailings-management#:~:text=,and%20compliance%20and%20enforcement%20processes)) ([Tailings Management | Alberta Energy Regulator](https://www.aer.ca/understanding-resource-development/resource-development-topics/tailings/tailings-management#:~:text=,the%20project%20has%20been%20exceeded)). If a company anticipates needing more tailings storage than currently approved, it must **apply to the AER to amend its approvals**. This involves submitting a detailed application (often an Environmental Protection and Enhancement Act amendment and an Oil Sands Conservation Act amendment) describing the new or expanded tailings facility, its design, capacity, environmental impacts, and how it will be managed within the tailings framework ([Tailings Management | Alberta Energy Regulator](https://www.aer.ca/understanding-resource-development/resource-development-topics/tailings/tailings-management#:~:text=,and%20compliance%20and%20enforcement%20processes)). For example, when Syncrude sought approval for its Mildred Lake Extension (MLX) mining project, it had to demonstrate how tailings from the new mine would be handled without exceeding regulated volumes. (Notably, regulators approved MLX in 2022 with the understanding that **no additional external tailings pond** would be needed – Syncrude would use existing capacity and mined-out pits for tailings ([After a 5-year review, provincial regulators approve Syncrude's plan ...](https://www.oilsandsmagazine.com/news/2019/7/23/after-a-5-year-review-alberta-regulators-approve-extension-of-mildred-lake-operations#:~:text=,Feed)).)

The **application process** for a new tailings pond typically requires an environmental impact assessment and public consultation if it involves a new footprint. The AER will evaluate dam safety, seepage control, water management, and closure plans as part of the review. Every tailings dam in Alberta must also comply with dam safety requirements (under Alberta’s Dam and Canal Safety regulations) and the proponent must post financial security for eventual reclamation. Currently, **there is a strong policy push to avoid creating new tailings ponds**. Federal Environment Minister Steven Guilbeault has stated a **policy of denying new tailings pond licenses** until the industry addresses the problems with existing tailings ([‘Industry will be held accountable’: Feds allocate $12 million to study oil sands impacts in Fort Chipewyan - IndigiNews](https://indiginews.com/news/feds-allocate-12-million-to-study-oil-sands-impacts-in-fort-chipewyan#:~:text=Minister%20Guilbeault%20said%20he%E2%80%99ll%20continue,tailings%20pond%20issues%20are%20found)). This reflects public and Indigenous concern that adding capacity just perpetuates the problem. Practically, this means operators are encouraged to maximize the use of **in-pit storage** (placing tailings into mined-out pits as they become available) and improve tailings treatment to reduce volumes, rather than build new external tailings impoundments. Nonetheless, if an operator truly requires a new pond, they would need to go through AER’s application process, which includes updating the TMP, demonstrating the need, and proposing mitigation. Alberta has eight active oil sands mining operations, and **all must report annually on their tailings status**. The AER specifically requires companies to forecast **available storage capacity and five-year storage requirements** in these reports ([Syncrude Canada Limited – Application for Aurora North Tailings Management Plan (AER Decision 20180613A) - Regulatory Law Chambers](https://regulatorylawchambers.ca/2018-12-6-syncrude-canada-limited-application-for-aurora-north-tailings-management-plan-aer-decision-20180613a/#:~:text=report%20annually%20on%20the%20available,for%20the%20next%20five%20years)). Thus, any looming capacity shortfall should be identified years in advance and trigger the regulatory process for expansion or alternative solutions.

In summary, expanding tailings capacity in Alberta involves a **formal regulatory approval** with technical review and, increasingly, political scrutiny. No company can simply start a new tailings pond – it must be approved as part of the project’s operating license. Current regulations (AER Directive 085 and related approvals) set volume thresholds (“triggers” and “limits”) for each project; exceeding those would prompt enforcement action ([Tailings Management | Alberta Energy Regulator](https://www.aer.ca/understanding-resource-development/resource-development-topics/tailings/tailings-management#:~:text=,the%20project%20has%20been%20exceeded)). The AER can direct an operator at **Level 2 or 3 (approaching limits)** to take remedial steps, potentially including seeking new storage if absolutely necessary ([Tailings Management | Alberta Energy Regulator](https://www.aer.ca/understanding-resource-development/resource-development-topics/tailings/tailings-management#:~:text=,the%20project%20has%20been%20exceeded)). However, given the public concern, **operators face pressure to manage within existing footprints** until technologies (like water treatment or tailings drying) can free up capacity.

## 4. Estimated Costs to Build a New Tailings Pond

Constructing a new oil sands tailings pond is an **immense undertaking**, and the costs are correspondingly high. Industry data and analogues suggest that a single large tailings pond can cost **hundreds of millions to over a billion dollars** to design and build. For example, a mining industry source noted that for oil sands operations, it can cost on the order of **$50 million** just to construct _each additional meter of height_ for a tailings dam around a new pond ([Oil crash hasn't slowed industry research on oilsands innovation](https://www.nationalobserver.com/2017/04/13/news/oil-crash-hasnt-slowed-industry-research-oilsands-innovation#:~:text=innovation%20www,size%20means%20big%20savings)). This striking figure reflects the huge scale of these impoundments – tailings dams often stretch for kilometers, so raising the perimeter by one meter involves moving and compacting vast quantities of material. Building an entirely new pond (with dam heights of, say, 20–30 m or more) from scratch easily runs into the **billions of dollars**. As a point of comparison, a relatively small tailings storage facility at a metal mine (Silvercorp’s TSF in China) cost about **US$28 million** for its first phase ([Tailings Storage Facility No. 3 and New 1,500 tonne per day Mill ...](https://silvercorpmetals.com/tailings-storage-facility-no-3-and-new-1500-tonne-per-day-mill-expansion-completed-and-in-operation-at-ying-mine-china/#:~:text=,February%2024%2C%202022%20news)); but oil sands tailings ponds are far larger in volume and area.

Historical project data back up the high cost range. Suncor’s Tailings Reduction Operations (TRO) project (completed in the early 2010s, which involved tailings dewatering facilities and dike construction) was reported to be a **>$1 billion investment** largely aimed at avoiding the need for additional ponds. Similarly, industry analysts have implicitly valued tailings management infrastructure in the **multi-billion dollar range** when factoring into project capital costs. For instance, in 2016 Total E&P Canada estimated that the **treatment and reclamation of fluid tailings across industry could cost $44.5 billion** over the life of the projects ([](https://environmentaldefence.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/AlbertaTailingsPondsReportFINAL.pdf#:~:text=industry%E2%80%99s%20own%20figures%20suggest%20that,billion%20and%20growing%2C%20and%20reclaiming)). While that figure includes long-term remediation, it underscores that creating and then dealing with tailings ponds is extremely expensive. Simply maintaining existing ponds (dike raises, seepage control, operations) is a significant ongoing cost; constructing new ones adds to both capital and eventual liability.

In summary, the **cost to build a new tailings pond** for an oil sands mine is on the order of **several hundred million to over a billion dollars**, depending on its size. A specific estimate often cited informally is that _every meter of tailings dam height = ~$50 million_ in capital cost ([Oil crash hasn't slowed industry research on oilsands innovation](https://www.nationalobserver.com/2017/04/13/news/oil-crash-hasnt-slowed-industry-research-oilsands-innovation#:~:text=innovation%20www,size%20means%20big%20savings)). Thus, companies are keen to avoid building new ponds if possible, not only for environmental reasons but because of these steep costs. (It’s worth noting that the **“cheapest” capacity** is usually to deposit tailings into mined-out pits, since the pit’s geology forms part of the containment – but even in-pit deposition requires building closure dams and is not free of cost.)

## 5. Timeline for New Tailings Pond Construction

**Long lead times** are required to bring new tailings storage on stream, meaning operators must plan well in advance to avoid interrupting production. The process of designing, permitting, and building a large tailings pond can easily take **5–7 years or more**. For example, if a company projects that its current ponds will be full by 2030, it would realistically need to initiate engineering studies and regulatory applications by the mid-2020s to have a new facility ready on time. In fact, the AER’s requirement that operators report five-year tailings storage needs ([Syncrude Canada Limited – Application for Aurora North Tailings Management Plan (AER Decision 20180613A) - Regulatory Law Chambers](https://regulatorylawchambers.ca/2018-12-6-syncrude-canada-limited-application-for-aurora-north-tailings-management-plan-aer-decision-20180613a/#:~:text=report%20annually%20on%20the%20available,for%20the%20next%20five%20years)) is explicitly to ensure they **start planning new capacity at least five years ahead** of any shortfall.

The timeline typically breaks down as follows: **1–2 years for regulatory approval**, including environmental impact assessments if needed; **1 year for detailed engineering and procurement**; and **2–3 years for construction of dikes, seepage systems, and water diversion infrastructure**, followed by commissioning. This means even in a best-case scenario, a new tailings pond might take ~5 years from concept to completion. In practice, it can take longer if there are delays in approval or construction (e.g. due to weather or geotechnical challenges). During the approval stage, there may be public hearings or additional information requests that add time. For instance, earlier tailings plan applications (circa 2009 under Directive 074) were submitted, reviewed, and in some cases re-submitted over multiple years ([](https://environmentaldefence.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/AlbertaTailingsPondsReportFINAL.pdf#:~:text=Alberta%E2%80%99s%20first%20attempt%20to%20regulate,volume%20of%20tailings%20to%20peak)) ([](https://environmentaldefence.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/AlbertaTailingsPondsReportFINAL.pdf#:~:text=Yet%2C%20proposals%20submitted%20by%20oil,this%20increasing%20liability%2C%20Albertan%20taxpayers)). More recently, the focus has shifted to **managing within existing capacity**, so no entirely new external pond has been approved in over a decade – which implies that if one were proposed now, it could face extra scrutiny and thus a lengthy review.

Operators will want to **avoid any production constraints**, so they generally set internal triggers to start new storage projects well before the last bit of existing capacity is used. For example, an operator might decide that when their ponds hit ~80–90% capacity, it’s time to have additional space coming online. If we use the industry projections from above: suppose a mine expects to hit full capacity in 2030 with no intervention – that operator would likely need to begin the regulatory process by around 2024–2025. Indeed, Suncor had been pursuing a “Base Mine Extension” project (which would include new mining areas and presumably tailings areas) aiming for regulatory approval by the mid-2020s so that it could commence by 2030 ([A look ahead to 2028 — Part 2: Expansion plans among mine operators | Oil Sands Magazine](https://www.oilsandsmagazine.com/news/2025/1/10/mining-forecast-2028-oilsands-mining#:~:text=The%20company%20says%20it%20has,side%20of%20the%20Athabasca%20River)) ([A look ahead to 2028 — Part 2: Expansion plans among mine operators | Oil Sands Magazine](https://www.oilsandsmagazine.com/news/2025/1/10/mining-forecast-2028-oilsands-mining#:~:text=MLX%20is%20expected%20to%20be,winding%20down%20operations%20in%202030)). (That project is now on hold, but it illustrates timing – they started the application roughly 7+ years before needing it.) Similarly, Syncrude’s Aurora South expansion was shelved partly due to the tailings challenge and timing.

In summary, to **avoid production impacts**, operators likely need to **begin new tailings pond construction ~5 years before** existing capacity is exhausted. Given some sites could hit limits in the late 2020s (if no other solution is found), this suggests **new pond planning would have to start now (mid-2020s)**. The current strategy for most producers, however, is to delay the need for new ponds through tailings treatment and (potentially) future water release – buying time so that perhaps **new pond construction can be avoided altogether**. If those strategies falter, we would see applications for new tailings facilities before long. The AER’s monitoring will flag if any project is approaching its approved limit well ahead of time, so regulators and companies should have a timeline in place to add storage or curtail output to stay within safe limits.

## 6. Outlook for Releasing Treated Tailings Water

A major question is whether – and when – the oil sands industry will be allowed to **release treated tailings water** into the environment, which could relieve pressure on pond capacities. As of today (2025), **no release of untreated or treated tailings effluent is permitted** – there is _no federal regulation_ that authorizes oil sands mines to discharge effluent, and the default under the Fisheries Act is that any such discharge is illegal ([Oil sands mining effluent - Canada.ca](https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/managing-pollution/sources-industry/mining-effluent/oil-sands.html#:~:text=One%20of%20the%20options%20under,affected%20water%20as%20effluent)) ([Oil sands mining effluent - Canada.ca](https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/managing-pollution/sources-industry/mining-effluent/oil-sands.html#:~:text=The%20Fisheries%20Act%20prohibits%20the,affected%20water%20as%20effluent)). Recognizing that indefinite water storage is unsustainable, the governments and industry have been working on a solution. In 2021, a **Crown-Indigenous Working Group (CIWG)** was formed, including federal regulators (Environment and Climate Change Canada) and Indigenous communities, to explore options for oil sands mine water management ([Guilbeault says releasing treated tailings may not be only way](https://cabinradio.ca/128606/news/politics/guilbeault-says-releasing-treated-tailings-may-not-be-only-way/#:~:text=A%20Crown,to%20mention%20the%20NWT%20government)) ([Oil sands mining effluent - Canada.ca](https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/managing-pollution/sources-industry/mining-effluent/oil-sands.html#:~:text=In%20recognition%20of%20the%20importance,recommendations%20for%20a%20path%20forward)). One option on the table is developing **regulations for treated effluent release** with strict water quality criteria ([Guilbeault says releasing treated tailings may not be only way](https://cabinradio.ca/128606/news/politics/guilbeault-says-releasing-treated-tailings-may-not-be-only-way/#:~:text=One%20option%20is%20treating%20that,it%20into%20the%20river%20system)) ([Oil sands mining effluent - Canada.ca](https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/managing-pollution/sources-industry/mining-effluent/oil-sands.html#:~:text=One%20of%20the%20options%20under,affected%20water%20as%20effluent)).

**Regulatory timeline:** The CIWG and ECCC have outlined a tentative timeline to have a regulatory framework in place by **late 2025** ([Guilbeault says releasing treated tailings may not be only way](https://cabinradio.ca/128606/news/politics/guilbeault-says-releasing-treated-tailings-may-not-be-only-way/#:~:text=A%20Crown,to%20mention%20the%20NWT%20government)). Indeed, Minister Steven Guilbeault stated the plan is to finalize regulations by 2025, although he emphasized that the timeline will respect the working group’s pace and community comfort ([Guilbeault says releasing treated tailings may not be only way](https://cabinradio.ca/128606/news/politics/guilbeault-says-releasing-treated-tailings-may-not-be-only-way/#:~:text=A%20Crown,to%20mention%20the%20NWT%20government)) ([Guilbeault says releasing treated tailings may not be only way](https://cabinradio.ca/128606/news/politics/guilbeault-says-releasing-treated-tailings-may-not-be-only-way/#:~:text=and%20releasing%20the%20water%20back,there%20may%20be%20other%20options)). As of March 2025, a discussion paper on policy options has been released for public comment ([Discussion paper: Path forward for evaluating policy options for managing the accumulation of oil sands mine water in tailings ponds - Canada.ca](https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/managing-pollution/sources-industry/mining-effluent/oil-sands/discussion-paper-crown-indigenous-working-group-2025.html#:~:text=2)) ([Discussion paper: Path forward for evaluating policy options for managing the accumulation of oil sands mine water in tailings ponds - Canada.ca](https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/managing-pollution/sources-industry/mining-effluent/oil-sands/discussion-paper-crown-indigenous-working-group-2025.html#:~:text=regulatory%20framework%20is%20targeted%20for,recommendation%20to%20the%20Minister%20will)), indicating progress toward defining the rules. If all goes as planned, **2025** could see draft regulations under the Fisheries Act that set limits on contaminants (naphthenic acids, metals, etc.) for any released water ([Oil sands mining effluent - Canada.ca](https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/managing-pollution/sources-industry/mining-effluent/oil-sands.html#:~:text=If%20developed%2C%20regulations%20would%20allow,quality%20standards%20that%20could%20include)). However, even if regulations are finalized by end of 2025, companies would not start releasing water immediately. They would first need to build or upgrade water treatment facilities to meet the new standards, and regulators would likely approve releases cautiously (perhaps pilot projects or gradual ramp-ups).

**Technical feasibility:** The oil sands operators have been developing water treatment technologies for years, and there are **proven treatment methods** for many contaminants in tailings water ([Oil Sands Treated Mine Water Release - The Mining Association of Canada](https://mining.ca/our-focus/corporate-responsibility/oil-sands-treated-mine-water-release/#:~:text=Proven%20Treatment%20Technologies)). Suspended solids, salts, and some metals can be treated with processes used in other mining sectors ([Oil Sands Treated Mine Water Release - The Mining Association of Canada](https://mining.ca/our-focus/corporate-responsibility/oil-sands-treated-mine-water-release/#:~:text=Proven%20Treatment%20Technologies)). The hardest challenge is the organic compounds unique to oil sands, like _naphthenic acids_, which are toxic and not easily broken down. Companies like Suncor and Syncrude have pilot projects (e.g. Suncor’s pit lake trial at Base Mine Lake, and Syncrude’s water capping research) to see if biological or chemical processes can degrade these compounds. While progress has been made, **full-scale treatment to drinking-water-like standards is not yet demonstrated**. The likely scenario is that initial regulations will set stringent but achievable limits (perhaps similar to those for metal mines’ effluent, with additional specs for naphthenic acids). Industry will then employ a combination of technologies (advanced oxidation, wetlands, filtration) to meet them. _In short, technically the industry is cautiously optimistic it can treat and release water safely, but final proof will come with operational experience._

**Realistic timing:** Considering regulatory and technical factors, a realistic outlook is that **the first controlled releases of treated tailings water could happen in the **late 2020s**. Perhaps by **2026 or 2027**, one or two operators will conduct small-scale releases (under stringent monitoring) if the regulations are in force by 2025–26. Full routine releases – meaning each mine regularly treating and discharging some volume – will likely take a bit longer, maybe around **2028–2030**, once trust is built that the water is safe. There is significant **public and Indigenous opposition** to any release until it is proven safe ([Guilbeault says releasing treated tailings may not be only way](https://cabinradio.ca/128606/news/politics/guilbeault-says-releasing-treated-tailings-may-not-be-only-way/#:~:text=for%20the%20release%20of%20treated,to%20mention%20the%20NWT%20government)). Communities downstream (in the Athabasca River and the Northwest Territories) remember past promises and are understandably skeptical; this was heightened by the Kearl spill news in 2023, which “reignited” opposition to releasing any tailings water ([Guilbeault says releasing treated tailings may not be only way](https://cabinradio.ca/128606/news/politics/guilbeault-says-releasing-treated-tailings-may-not-be-only-way/#:~:text=for%20the%20release%20of%20treated,to%20mention%20the%20NWT%20government)). Therefore, even if technically ready by 2025, the **social license** for releases may lag. The federal government has committed that it will not push through a solution without Indigenous buy-in ([Guilbeault says releasing treated tailings may not be only way](https://cabinradio.ca/128606/news/politics/guilbeault-says-releasing-treated-tailings-may-not-be-only-way/#:~:text=In%20an%20interview%20with%20Cabin,there%20may%20be%20other%20options)). Guilbeault even noted that alternatives to release are being examined in case consensus can’t be reached ([Guilbeault says releasing treated tailings may not be only way](https://cabinradio.ca/128606/news/politics/guilbeault-says-releasing-treated-tailings-may-not-be-only-way/#:~:text=In%20an%20interview%20with%20Cabin,there%20may%20be%20other%20options)).

Overall, the industry **will eventually need to release treated water** to close the mines – you simply cannot permanently store all water forever. The question is one of **when and how**. Given the urgency (tailings water volumes are huge and growing) ([Guilbeault says releasing treated tailings may not be only way](https://cabinradio.ca/128606/news/politics/guilbeault-says-releasing-treated-tailings-may-not-be-only-way/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThe%20idea%20that%20we%20can,%E2%80%9D)) ([Guilbeault says releasing treated tailings may not be only way](https://cabinradio.ca/128606/news/politics/guilbeault-says-releasing-treated-tailings-may-not-be-only-way/#:~:text=As%20of%202021%2C%20Alberta%E2%80%99s%20oil,and%20metals)), and the concerted efforts underway, the **consensus outlook** is that treated releases will begin on a limited, carefully monitored basis in a few years. By **2030**, it is plausible that a robust regulatory system is in place and several mines are routinely releasing treated effluent during certain seasons, under strict conditions. If unforeseen technical issues arise or public opposition remains unresolved, timelines could slip further; but the current trajectory (as of 2025) is aiming for a resolution sooner rather than later. ECCC has explicitly recognized that continuing to accumulate water in ponds is _unsustainable_ and that “we need to find a solution” ([Guilbeault says releasing treated tailings may not be only way](https://cabinradio.ca/128606/news/politics/guilbeault-says-releasing-treated-tailings-may-not-be-only-way/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThe%20idea%20that%20we%20can,%E2%80%9D)). In conclusion, while **2025** is the target for the _paperwork_ (regulations) to be done, a **realistic** start for actual water release is **around 2026–2027**, with broader implementation by the end of the decade – assuming treatments meet the high safety standards required and community confidence is earned.
