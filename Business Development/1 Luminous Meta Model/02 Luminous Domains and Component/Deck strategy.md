1. Big Change is coming
	- Regulation to release water is coming
	- This will be a tough target to hit

2. There will be winners and losers
- Winners 
	- Can get ahead of the regulation 
	- Meet or exceed
	- Build good will with Stakeholders
	- Transparent
-  and losers
	- Unable to meet regulations for decades
	- Release bad water into the environment
	- Unable to prove water quality
	- Unable to detect sudden changes

3. Wouldn't it be great if...?
	- You could have full snapshot of the NA concentration in your water?
	- Updated frequently
	- With the ability to analyze trends and make informed decisions 
	- at a fraction of the cost of current testing methods.
	- you could have the native microbes to help meet the new regulatory targets? 

4. Here is your magic wand
	- Cheap fast and easy biosensors allow you to test more places more frequently to get better understanding and a higher resolution of NA's in your water
	- every test is captured with data platform to give rich information and facilitate better decision making
	- Accelerated remediation to hit your target for release faster.

5. Here is the proof
	 - 10 years research working with Oil Sands providers (CNRL, Imperial Oil)
	 - Backed by Athabasca University and UofC
	 - Test Results validated by Mass Spectrometry 



# **Luminous BioSolutions – The Future of Tailings Pond Water Management**

## **1. The Scale of the Challenge: Tailings Ponds & Naphthenic Acid Pollution**

The challenge facing the oil sands industry is **massive**—both in **scale and complexity**:

**1.4 trillion litres** of process-affected water sit in tailings ponds across Alberta.  **Naphthenic acids (NAs) are toxic**—harming wetlands, wildlife, and human health.  **Severe ecological impacts**—NAs persist in water for decades, affecting aquatic life and ecosystems.  **Traditional monitoring and cleanup methods are insufficient**—too slow, too expensive, and unable to scale.

**The industry needs a breakthrough solution—one that enables rapid, scalable monitoring and remediation.**

---

## **2. Regulation for Water Release is Coming – Are You Ready?**

New **federal and provincial regulations** are on the horizon, setting strict water quality targets for tailings pond water before it can be released into the environment.

**The Challenge:**

- These **targets will be tough to meet** given the **sheer scale and complexity** of tailings ponds.
    
- Traditional monitoring methods are **slow, expensive, and impractical** for frequent testing across large volumes of water.
    
- Industry leaders must **act now** to prepare for compliance—or risk being left behind.
    

📢 **Even if release is allowed, proving compliance will be the real challenge.**

## **3. Oil Sands Producers: Winners or Losers?**

**The industry is at a crossroads.** Some operators will lead, while others will struggle.

🚀 **Winners:** ✅ Get ahead of the curve by **meeting or exceeding** regulatory targets.  
✅ **Proactively monitor water quality** and provide transparency to stakeholders.  
✅ **Build trust and credibility** with regulators, communities, and investors.

⚠️ **Losers:** ❌ Fail to hit the water release standards, delaying reclamation.  
❌ Cannot prove water quality, facing increased scrutiny from regulators and the public.  
❌ Continue adding **financial and reputational risk** to downstream stakeholders.

💡 **The choice is yours: lead the industry or fall behind.**
