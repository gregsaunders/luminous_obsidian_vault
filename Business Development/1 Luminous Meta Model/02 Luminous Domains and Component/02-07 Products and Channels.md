### Products and Channels Domain
The **products and channels domain** describes the physical (non-digital) products and services offered by the organization to the market, as well as the physical channels through which the organization interacts with its customers, partners and the market in general.

- **Product Component** - A **product** is a physical artefact or provisioned service that has value to a consumer and is offered for sale as such. A product or service is considered physical when it depends on the distribution of an item over a physical network such as a logistics network or even a mail network. Therefore even non-material services like financial services can be considered physical if they depend on the distribution of paper contracts or checks.
- **Channel Component** - A **channel** is an access point through which consumers or partners can interact with the organization to procure, consume or enquire about its products and services. Physical channels depend on the provision of physical infrastructure (e.g. shops, logistics networks, call centers) and people to operate them. In architecture modeling, channel components are generally used as a classifier for other component types (e.g. locations or external organizations).
- **Contract Component** - A **contract** is an agreement or undertaking between two or more parties (people or organizations) enforceable under law to provide goods and services or an equivalent undertaking. Understanding of contracts is important in business and IT planning since they both guarantee the supply of a product or service or realization of a capability, but may also constrain the organizationâ€™s ability to change course.
