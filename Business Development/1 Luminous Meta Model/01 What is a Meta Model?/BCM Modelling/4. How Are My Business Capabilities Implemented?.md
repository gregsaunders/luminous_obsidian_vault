#### How Are My Business Capabilities Implemented?

**What** - Map your business capabilities to Departments, Applications and People
**Who** - Enterprise Architects, Business Strategists, IT Strategists, Finance / IT Business Management
**How** - Calculated Fields, Dashboards, Ardoq Surveys

If you’ve read our Best Practice Guide you’ll know that business capabilities represent the what but not the how.

But it’s how your capabilities are implemented through people, process, technology and information that’s of critical importance. Once we’ve rated our capabilities by differentiation we need to understand our actual capability for each one.

The first step is to get a consolidated view of the people and systems which perform those capabilities. This then means connecting those business capabilities to the applications and departments that realize them.

In doing this, we’ll find that many capabilities map cleanly to those applications or organizational units.  For example, your finance department carries out finance capabilities, the marketing department runs campaigns and the sales application processes sales.

But don’t let that make you complacent. You’ll also find there are capabilities that don’t map so neatly to these department or system categories.

For example, who owns the master customer record? Marketing? Sales? Operations? All of the above?

Or who analyses sales figures? Sales, certainly. But marketing probably does too, as does finance. And when sales are made via a partner channel there may be yet another set of figures.

Once you see how capabilities are fragmented across your departments and applications it’s easy to spot the disjoints in your organization. You’ll find plenty of ‘hotspots’ where organizational accountabilities or system scopes aren’t as neatly demarcated as you might wish.

Each of the hotspots is an opportunity to optimize. 

#### Measuring Cost and Complexity
While the mapping of your departments and applications to your capability like this is insightful, it’s still easy to miss opportunities.

This is where we need to turn our mappings into metrics; the two most powerful being Cost and Complexity.

Capabilities (being abstract concepts) don’t directly carry cost - it’s the things that realize those capabilities, departments and systems that do. We can use these relationships to create a combined view of operational costs across both business and IT.

Using algorithms, we can both allocate and aggregate department and applications costs onto our business capabilities in a single combined view.

But calculating the cost of each capability alone may still not be actionable. Certainly, we can look for areas of high cost or low cost, but this tells us little about opportunity.

We also need to understand how efficiently those capabilities are implemented. This is where our second metric, complexity, comes into play.

Complexity is a crude but effective measure of efficiency. It counts how many things - departments or applications – implement each capability. It’s a fast way of seeing whether you have two departments duplicating processes or information, or two applications that perform the same function.

#### Combine a view of Cost and Complexity per capability and you start to tell a compelling story

A bubble chart will quickly show which of your business capabilities are high-cost and/ or high-complexity: these should be top of your list as rationalization candidates.

On the other hand high-cost but low complexity means you have a few expensive things – for example, a large Sales department, or a single expensive ERP application. And low-cost, high-complexity means that while you may have many departments or IT systems doing the same thing, that may not be financially material. You could spend more money trying to simplify than you’d save.

Of course, system and organizational complexity has many implications beyond the purely financial. Risk and business agility are just two. Over time you’ll want to put other lenses on your business capability model.

But in starting to use your business capability model to tell stories about business performance, cost is a great place to start.
