Now let’s break down what happens inside the **operations box.**

At this point you might expect to see **business processes, departments and IT systems**, but we’ll keep it higher-level than that for a moment.

To create products and services to offer to the wider environment, the organization must process or transform something into something that has value.

So we break the operation down into a layer that describes **what is processed, what the processes are, who or what performs that processing, and where those resources are located.**

In this version of the model, processed is restricted to information, but same principles can be applied to **materials (i.e. in manufacturing).**
