To create a model of an organization we need to break that organization down into the parts that make it up. A metamodel tells you what types of things those part they are and how they relate to each other.

Most people understand that organizations are made up of **people, process and technology**. A metamodel defines just that (but with a little more science).  Those parts are called **components**, and they have different types, like **departments, applications, servers or locations**.

The **relationships** between the parts are called **references** and also have different types. For example, a department **owns** a database, or a server is **located** at a location.

Having standard types of component and reference is what enables us to build consistent models. And having consistent models is what enables us to build a model of the whole organization - or any part of it - we can use for analysis and planning.
