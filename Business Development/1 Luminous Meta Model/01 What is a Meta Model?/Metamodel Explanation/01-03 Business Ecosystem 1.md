At the highest level we represent the organization as a black box which interacts with its environment.

We commonly model three categories of external actor: **Markets**, other **organizations**, and **people**.

At this level we don’t model individual people, so we group them into **customer segments** or abstract them into **personas**.

External environments can also be modelled. For example, the **natural environment** or the **media**.

The organization interacts with these actors and environments through **flows** of information, materials or resources.

Creating models at this level (like **business ecosystem models**) is useful for outside-in analysis and planning of the organization’s external interactions.
