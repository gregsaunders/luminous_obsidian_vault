### **30-Second Elevator Pitch (Casual Professional)**

Luminous BioSolutions is tackling one of the biggest environmental challenges in the oil sands — toxic naphthenic acids in tailings ponds. We’ve developed a breakthrough system using bioluminescent bacteria to detect these toxins in real time, plus smart microbial treatments to break them down safely. It’s faster, cheaper, and more scalable than traditional lab testing, and it helps operators meet tough environmental and regulatory demands while reducing their long-term cleanup costs.

### **2-Minute Elevator Pitch (Expanded Version)**

Luminous BioSolutions is a cleantech company focused on solving the massive environmental and financial problem of naphthenic acids in oil sands tailings ponds. These acids are toxic, hard to treat, and incredibly expensive to monitor using current lab methods — which can take weeks and cost thousands.

Our team has developed a game-changing, three-part solution:

1. **Real-time biosensors** that use engineered bacteria to instantly detect toxic compounds — it’s like having a lab in the field that gives results in minutes, not weeks.
    
2. **Targeted microbial remediation**, using natural bacteria to actually break down the toxins right in the ponds.
    
3. **A cloud-based data platform** that tracks and analyzes everything, helping operators stay compliant and make better decisions with predictive insights.
    

We’re working with oil sands operators and environmental consultants to run pilot projects, prove the value, and scale. Our tech saves money, accelerates cleanup, improves transparency, and helps industry players show leadership on ESG. It’s high-impact innovation for one of the toughest environmental challenges in Canada.

### **2-Minute Investor Elevator Pitch**

Luminous BioSolutions is positioned to transform how the oil sands industry manages its most pressing environmental liability — toxic naphthenic acids in tailings ponds.

Currently, operators rely on lab tests that are slow, expensive, and reactive. We’re bringing a better way:

- Our **biosensors** use engineered bacteria to detect toxins in real time — results in minutes, not weeks.
    
- Our **targeted microbial treatments** break down the toxins at the source.
    
- And our **analytics platform** helps operators stay ahead of regulatory and ESG pressures with predictive data.
    

The market is large and motivated — over $45B in tailings liabilities, with strong regulatory and public pressure to act. We’re targeting major operators for pilot projects and already have interest. Our model blends sensor sales, remediation services, and SaaS — high-margin and scalable.

We’re raising $2.5M to fund these pilots, scale production, and build out the core team. With the right backing, we can lead the shift toward intelligent, sustainable tailings management — and capture significant value in the process.
