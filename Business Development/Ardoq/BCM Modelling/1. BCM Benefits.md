#### **Be able to confidently answer your stakeholders’ questions**
1. **What** - What are my core business activities - my Business Capabilities?
2. **What** - What systems, people and processes implement them?
3. **Which** - Which of those do I compete on?
4. **How** - How mature is each one?

#### For Many Years Business and IT Spoke Different Languages
Externally, business focussed on products, partners and customer segments. Internally, on business process re-engineering or outsourcing.

Meanwhile IT concentrated on technology infrastructure, applications and data.

Where IT and business did touch, the emphasis was on defining formalized hand-offs, usually expressed as IT Services.

**In essence, IT was conceived as a supporting layer that underpinned those business processes. But like oil and water, the two never mixed. Many organizations still model their architecturethis way.**

The problem is this ‘segregated’ view doesn’t adequately meet the strategic planning needs of either business or IT.

For example, re-engineering a business process to improve customer experience is hugely constrained when a big part of that customer experience is the performance of the organization’s own IT systems.

In the same way, IT planners trying to optimize IT value and efficiency realized they couldn’t do so without a solid understanding of the functionality the business required.

After years defining IT service models or logical application models it became increasingly clear they were largely attempting to describe their organization’s business model.

If information technology represents the automation of the business’s operations – and increasingly the digitalisation of its products and services – then using different languages to describe the same requirements is practically a guarantee of misalignment.

##### IT and Business Are Two Sides of the Same Coin 
So somewhere between business processes and IT services another concept has steadily gained  
influence over recent years. One that simultaneously describes the concerns of both business and IT planners: **Business capabilities**.

As so often has been the case, conventional architecture and planning methods have lagged behind reality. Digital, Agile and cross-functional product teams mean that business and technology are now well and truly mixed.

To stay relevant, strategy and architecture teams must keep pace.
