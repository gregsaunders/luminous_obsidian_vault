# Build out Ardoq

### 1. Get Data in
- Ardoq Best Practice capability Model - Pick industry
### 2. Get your Capabilities in
- Excel Importer
- XML
- Ardoq API
### 3. Get People in
- Excel Importer
- Azure AD
- Ardoq API
- Build relationships
- Is expert in
- Owns
### 4. Visualize your data
- Dependency Map View
	- Allows you to easily see relationships or hierarchy in a compact nested visual. Great for showing the hierarchy (L0-L4) of a business capability model.
- Capability Map View
    - Allows you to easily see relationships or hierarchy in a compact nested visual. Great for showing capabilities and their experts. The capability map offers a little bit more control on layout than the Dependency Map
- Component Matrix
    - Enables you to visualize your data in a multidimensional matrix. Here, you can see the experts and the departments that realize each capability.
- Table View
    - Allows you to view your capability data in a table format showing metadata and references.
### 5. Assess Data Completeness
- Build search or query's that are used to populate the widgets in the dashboards.
    - Advanced search: Your basic building block search.
    - Gremlin query: For the more complex queries that leverage the capabilities of underlying graph.
    - Leverage prebuilt data quality queries following the BCM metamodel.
        - Capabilities missing Market Differentiation
        - Capabilities Requiring Review
        - Capabilities missing Maturity
        - Capabilities with No Experts
### 6. Develop Data Quality Dashboard
- Now that we have the queries built, we can plug them into a dashboard or leverage the prebuilt Capability Data Quality Dashboard. Dashboards allow you to surface up action items, and pinpoint gaps and fill them.
### 7. Socialize the Model
- This is a critical step to
    - Fill in the gaps
    - Find out what we dont know
    - Find missing capabilities
    - Make sure this truely represents the business
    - Develop BCM With Stakeholders
        - Introduce them to the concept of capabilities
        - Allow them to voice their perspective on how they view their business
        - Get better quality through stakeholder validation
        - Better alignment and adoption
        - This exercise can be very challenging and time consuming as not everyone knows what a capability is, or understands the value. To help facilitate these discussions, there is a prebuilt primer deck and survey that can be used to streamline the process.
    - Creating Surveys - Collaborating to Fill in the Gaps
        - Go to the Surveys page in Ardoq
        - Build your own
        - Or use prebuilt survey
            - Key Capability Survey - This survey is for the Architecture function to be used in a discussion with your stakeholders to help improve model development.
    - Send Surveys with Brodcast
### 8. Analyze results
- Generate and deliver custom views and presentations to share with Stakeholders
### 9. Anchoring the results
- This work provides value when it is used to inform decision making.
    - Now take this BCM and anchor it in the continuous governance process of your IT org.
    - Previous socialization should help with adoption and alignment with business partners.
    - Quick Check before presenting to stakeholders
        - Who is the audience? This might influence the data presented in the visuals
        - What are the problems we are trying to solve, and did we solve them? Did you add your own or just use the predefined questions?
        - How has this helped? What was the current state before this work, and how has working through this exercise provided value, can we articulate it?
        - What comes next? Now that this work is completed, what needs to be done next, what are the options?
### 10. Maintain the data
- This adds continued value
- Send Broadcasts at predefined times to ensure data is up-to-date.
    - This establishes confidence and credibility with the EA Team
    - Determine if the intervals work for you and your org.
        - Fast paced lots of change more frequent
### 11. The Path Forward
