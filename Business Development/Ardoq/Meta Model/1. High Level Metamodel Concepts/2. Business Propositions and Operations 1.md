Next we open up the black box to see what itâ€™s made up of.

We break the organization down into two high-level concepts: Its **propositions** and its **operations**.

Propositions are the **products** and **services** the organization offers to its environment, as well as the **channels** through which they can be accessed.

Operations are the internal **systems**, **processes**, **information** and **resources** it uses to create and serve those propositions.

Propositions can also be used to define the **internal products and services** that one part of the organization provides to another. However we discourage this type of modelling as it reduces the transparency of operations.

Creating models at this level, such as a **Business Model Canvas**, helps an organization understand how it can both optimise its offerings to the external environment and the efficiency of its internal operations and resources.
