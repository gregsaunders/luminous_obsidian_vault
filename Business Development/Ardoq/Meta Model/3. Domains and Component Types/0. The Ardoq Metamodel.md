#### What Are Metamodels?

Metamodels define the structure of your components and references through one-on-one relationships with your workspaces.

**_NB_**_: Ardoq used to be inconsistent in the wording when referring to the Metamodel by also using the term Model. This has since been fixed in the GUI, but the inconsistency still remains in the naming of the API endpoint._

# What Is a Metamodel?

The metamodel shows how your component types are actually connected through references. The metamodel governs how you document and structure your information.

When you document in Ardoq, you have to create a [workspace](https://help.ardoq.com/en/articles/44160-what-is-a-workspace) that uses a metamodel for structuring your information. There is a one-to-one relationship between metamodels and workspaces. Every metamodel is associated with one workspace and vice versa.

You can think of a metamodel as a database schema that defines the hierarchy of pages and valid relationships between the pages inside a workspace. The metamodel allows Ardoq to automatically create visualizations, as well as validate input.

If you use the “Business Process” metamodel it looks like this:

This is a basic hierarchy showing how Business Processes are the top-level “parent” and different types of steps are children of a Business Process.
