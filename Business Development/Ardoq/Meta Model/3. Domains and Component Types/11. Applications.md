### Applications Domain
The applications domain represent dynamic automated processes instantiated as software. These processes represent the automation of business operations or customer requirements. The main component type in this domain are application and integration.

- **Application Component** - An application is the configuration of lower-level software or technology to provide specific business capability or technology capability, perform a defined task or analyze specific information. An application represents the automation of human tasks and is designed to be directly used by humans. Applications are distinct from other classes of technology in that they are aligned to the requirements of humans and not to the technical requirements or dependencies of other software.
- **Interface Component** - An interface is a dedicated point of interaction between two or more applications or other technology components. It implements functionality to enable interoperability and exchange of information, including agreed behavior, common semantics and defined security and availability.
- **Application Group Component** - An application group represents a family or suite of applications (for example, Microsoft Office or Google Work). Since applications may be grouped by multiple user-defined dimensions - for example, the business processes or product they support or the department that owns them - it is important to emphasize that this grouping applies to the packaging, licensing or deployment of applications as defined by the manufacturer.
- **Application Module Component** - An application module is any sub-component of an application including (but not restricted to) user interfaces, code modules, data storage and even user-defined configurations that involve no code changes. Some application modules may resemble or even evolve into applications in themselves, so determining what is an application and what is a modules can be somewhat arbitrary.
