### Strategy and Objectives Domain
The **strategy and objectives** domain defines organizational direction. It articulates the key strategic themes for the organization and the outcomes it wishes to realize. These can relate to any part of its propositions and operations and typically span both. However, for the realization of its strategies the organization relies on the innovation and change domain.

- **Strategy Component** - A **strategy** is a plan or scheme to achieve a long-term or high-level outcome. Strategies can be decomposed into the outcomes they want to achieve and the methods or tactics they plan to use to achieve them. In organizations, strategies can be defined at any level, from team to business unit, and for any part of the architecture, from products to technology. However, those defined by organizational leadership are assumed to have primacy.

- **Objective Component** - An **objective** is a desired state outcome to be achieved by the organization. Objectives are the desired outcomes of strategies and are the means of determining whether a strategy has been realized. So well-defined objectives are typically measurable and time-bounded (e.g. ‘increase sales by 5% within three years’) but they can also simply be stated aspirations (e.g. ‘be the most customer-focussed software company in the world’).
