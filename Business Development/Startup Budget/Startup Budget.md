### 5. **Create a Financial Projection**
   - **Startup Capital Needed:** Sum of startup costs and 6-12 months of operating expenses to ensure cash flow.
   - **Income Statement (Profit & Loss):**
     - Forecast monthly income and expenses to determine your breakeven point.
   - **Cash Flow Statement:**
     - Track when money comes in and goes out to avoid running out of funds.
   - **Balance Sheet:** Record assets (equipment, cash) and liabilities (loans, payables).

### 6. **Add a Contingency**
   - Allocate 10-20% of your total budget for unexpected costs or delays.

### Example Framework
| **Category**              | **Startup Costs** | **Monthly Costs** |
|---------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Equipment & Software      | $5,000           | $200             |
| Office Setup              | $2,000           | $1,000           |
| Marketing                 | $3,000           | $500             |
| Professional Services     | $2,500           | $200             |
| Personnel (if any)        | -                | $5,000           |
| Subscriptions             | $500             | $100             |
| Miscellaneous/Contingency | $2,000           | $500             |
| **Total**                 | $15,000          | $7,500           |

---

### 8. **Calculate Capital Needs**
   - If your monthly costs are $7,500, and you want a 6-month runway:  
     **Startup Capital = $15,000 (startup costs) + ($7,500 x 6) = $60,000**
