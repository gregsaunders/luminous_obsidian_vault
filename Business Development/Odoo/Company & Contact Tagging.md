### Tagging Strategy

1. **Unified Identifiers:**  
   Assign a unique alphanumeric code to each record. This prevents duplication and improves traceability across systems.

2. **Multi-Tag Capability:**  
   Enable multiple tags per record. A company might serve as a supplier and a strategic partner, or an individual might be both an employee and a board member.

3. **Standardization and Governance:**  
   - **Naming Conventions:** Use a consistent naming convention (e.g., “Cust_”, “Pros_”, “Supp_”) for clarity.
   - **Metadata Tracking:** Capture creation, modification dates, and responsible users for audit purposes.
   - **Security & Access:** Implement role-based access control to ensure data integrity and prevent unauthorized changes.

4. **Flexibility and Scalability:**  
   Regularly review and refine your tags as your business evolves. This dynamic approach will keep your system relevant and reliable.

This strategy should provide you with robust sorting capabilities while ensuring data governance and security as your organization scales.
