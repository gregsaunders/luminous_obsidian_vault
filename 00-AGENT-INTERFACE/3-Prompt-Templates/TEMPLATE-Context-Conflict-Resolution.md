# Prompt: Context Conflict Resolution

**When to Use:** When you notice the Master Context is outdated or contradicts current decisions.

## The Prompt
```markdown
I have identified a conflict between the Master Context and our current work.

**The Conflict:**
*   **Master Context says:** [Quote what is wrong]
*   **Current Reality is:** [Explain what is true now]

**Request:**
1.  Confirm this conflict.
2.  Propose an update to `01-ACTIVE-BUSINESS/daily-operations/Luminous-Master-Context.md` (or the relevant strategy file).
3.  Draft the exact change (what to delete, what to add).
4.  If the old info is significant, propose moving it to the "Deprecated" section.
```
