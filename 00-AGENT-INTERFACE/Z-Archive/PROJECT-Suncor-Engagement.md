## Draft Email (Dr. Rodney Guest)
**Subject:** Intro: Luminous BioSolutions / James Guthrie & Steve Laut Context

Hi Dr. Guest,

My good friend James Guthrie suggested I reach out to you as you may be interested in knowing about a NAFC Biosensor technology we developed. We have just completed the multi-season Kearl Wetland Pilot and have great results benchmarked against Orbitrap Mass Spec!

We solve the "8-week blind spot" and lag time from HRMS testing. Our platform pairs rapid, low-cost biological testing with a Relational Context Engine and delivers operational insights invisible to current methods.

We validated this approach at the Imperial Kearl wetland, identifying over $250k/year operational savings by moving to a frequency-based monitoring model.

I’d love to connect to bring you up to speed on our solution and see if this is interesting to Suncor. 

With Oil Sands Tailings looking to move from containment to ready to release and closure this is an important opportunity.

Do you have time before the Christmas break?

Best,
Jeff
