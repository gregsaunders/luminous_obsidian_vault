# Project: CNRL Pilot (Q2 2026)

**Status:** 🟡 Active
**Owner:** Jeff
**Priority:** Critical

## Goal
Secure a paid commercial pilot at CNRL Albian for Q2 2026 start.

## Context
*   **Proposal:** `03-PRODUCTS/2-Squarehead-Foundry/frameworks/pilot-Proposal-integrated-water-readiness-infrastructure-V1.7.md`
*   **Agreement:** `03-PRODUCTS/2-Squarehead-Foundry/frameworks/pilot-agreement-terms-addendum.md`
*   **Strategy:** "Cost Recovery" + "Grant Matching".

## Tasks
- [ ] Schedule meeting with Theo & Jayne (Follow-up on last meeting, CDL update, Steve Laut's comments).
- [ ] Schedule meeting with Jean Paul (Separate CDL follow-up).
- [ ] Refine Pilot Proposal (if needed).
- [ ] Finalize Pilot Agreement (Legal Review).
- [ ] Secure Grant Matching (ERA/AI).

## Draft Email
**Subject:** Albian Pilot / Steve Laut Feedback

Hi Theo and Jayne,

Following up on our CDL week—we received distinct positive feedback from Steve Laut regarding our approach to operationalizing biological data.

We see a clear path to launch the Albian Wetland pilot this Spring (2026). I’ve discussed this with Alberta Innovates, and we can structure this to be a low-friction, cost-neutral initiative that allows you to master the multivariate complexity of your release objectives.

Do you have 15 minutes before the holidays to discuss? We’d love to align the strategy for Q1.

Best,
Jeff

## Draft Email (Innovation: JohnPaul & Jason)
**Subject:** CDL Update: Steve Laut Feedback & Kearl Wetland Savings ($260K/yr)

Hi JohnPaul and Jason,

Following up on our meeting at the CDL session—we had a very successful first week, securing 5 mentors to support our venture! We also received very positive feedback from Steve Laut regarding our approach to operationalizing biological data.

Since we last spoke, we have further quantified the impact of our biosensor technology. Based on data from the Imperial Kearl wetland pilot, we have identified at least $260k/year in direct operational efficiencies by moving from an 8-week testing lag to a 48-hour feedback loop.

I’d love to connect before the break to give you a brief update on where we are at and explore how we might help CNRL drive similar efficiencies in your tailings operations. The Albian Wetland is of particular interest to chat about.

Do you have time in the next few weeks?

Best,
Jeff
