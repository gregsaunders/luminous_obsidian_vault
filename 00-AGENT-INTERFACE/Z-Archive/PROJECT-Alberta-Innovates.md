**Subject:** Luminous BioSolutions / AU Spin-out & Pilot Funding

Hi Reesa,

Dr. Ramses Ilarraza and Alyse Pearce at Athabasca University mentioned that we should reach out to you regarding our startup Luminous BioSolutions.

We are the first venture to spin out of AU with a filed patent, commercializing a novel biosensor that solves the critical NAFC toxicity monitoring lags in the oil sands industry.

I’ve had several productive discussions with Mark Donner from Alberta Innovates regarding proposed pilot projects (aiming for Q2 2026 deployment). He indicated that our roadmap aligns well with the matching fund programs for project-based funding.

I’d love to connect before the Christmas break to discuss other funding opportunities for the startup capital required for Luminous.

Do you have time next week?

Best,
Jeff
