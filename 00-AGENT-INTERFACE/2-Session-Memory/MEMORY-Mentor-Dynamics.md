# Mentor Dynamics & Context Memory

This file tracks the evolving relationship strategy, personal insights, and "best way to engage" for each CDL Mentor.

## General Strategy: "Humble Confidence"
*   **Role:** You are the CEO executing a mission; they are the seasoned generals advising on terrain.
*   **Tone:** Peer-to-peer, not Pitch-to-Prospect.
*   **Technique:** Ask them to validate the "Insider Reality" vs your "Outsider Pitch".
