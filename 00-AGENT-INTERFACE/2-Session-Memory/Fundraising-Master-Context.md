# Fundraising Master Context

**Status:** Active - Pre-Seed Round Planning (Target: $2.5M CAD)
**Last Updated:** 2025-11-21
**Next Review:** Post-Nov 27 mentor call (budget validation)

---

## Current Status

**Capital Raised to Date:** $0 (bootstrapped)
**Current Runway:** ~9 months (as of Nov 2025, $7.5K/month burn rate)
**Funding Target:** $2.5M CAD (Scenario B) + Non-dilutive matching
**Timeline:** Budget finalized Week 1-4, pilot signed Q2 2026, close Q2 2026

**Strategic Pivot (Nov 21):**
We have shifted from a "Clean Tech Tool" pitch to an "Operational Intelligence Infrastructure" pitch. The ask has increased from $1.5M to $2.5M to secure the runway needed to capture the 18-month "Release Readiness" window before 2027 regulations drop.

---

## Fundraising Objectives (CDL Sprint 2 - Objective 2)

**OBJECTIVE 2 (Fundraising Readiness):**
Finalize 24-month pro-forma budget validating the $2.5M ask (Weeks 1-4 priority), positioned as "Infrastructure for Regulatory Release."

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] 24-month budget finalized with mentor validation (Week 4)
- [ ] Valuation framework documented (Infrastructure Premium + TRL 7-8)
- [ ] Non-dilutive funding applications submitted ($250K target)
- [ ] Investor pitch deck updated with "Accelerated Learning" & "Glass Box" narrative
- [ ] Pre-seed strategy finalized (Lead investor targeting: Data Infra vs. Clean Tech)

## Key Strategic Questions for Nov 27 Mentor Call

### Valuation Defence (The "Infrastructure Premium")

**Core Thesis:**
We are not asking investors to fund R&D risk (TRL 7-8 is proven). We are asking them to fund the **deployment of critical compliance infrastructure** for a massive regulatory shift (2027 Release).
* *Old Pitch:* Efficiency Tool ($1.5M ask).
* *New Pitch:* The "Operating System" for Water Release ($2.5M ask).

**Questions for Mentors (Terence/Dave):**
1. Does the "Release Readiness" narrative justify a higher pre-money valuation ($8M-$10M) compared to a standard hardware play?
2. We increased the ask to $2.5M to buffer against grant delays and accelerate platform scaling. Is this too aggressive for a pre-revenue seed in Alberta, or appropriate for the scale of the problem?
3. How do we position the "Offsite Lab" model to investors as a CAPEX-light scaling advantage?

### Budget & Use of Funds ($2.5M Scenario)

**Critical Decision:** Allocating the extra $1M capital.
- **Data Engineering (The Moat):** Investing heavily in the "Relational Context Engine" (Platform) to secure the data moat before competitors wake up.
- **Pilot Velocity (The Wedge):** Funding the "Offsite Lab" operations to handle 3-5 concurrent pilots without needing site access.

**Questions for Mentors (Jocelyn/Doug/Terence):**
1. Does the budget reflect enough "Software/Data" talent vs. "Field/Bio" talent? (Investors need to see we are building the Platform, not just selling sensors).
2. Is the "Offsite Lab" model credible to investors as a way to bypass site access delays?

### Timing Strategy

**The "18-Month Window" Urgency:**
- **The Market Reality:** Operators have 18 months to figure out release before 2027.
- **The Fundraising Implication:** We cannot afford to wait for pilot success to raise. We need capital NOW to be installed *before* the guidelines drop.

**Question:**
Does the "18-Month Regulatory Countdown" create enough FOMO to close a round pre-revenue?

## Week 1-4 Priorities (Before Budget Finalization)

**Tasks:**
1. **Update Valuation Framework:** Shift from standard TRL 7-8 defense to "Infrastructure Play" defense. → `valuation-framework.md`
2. **Revise 24-month budget:** Scale up to $2.5M Scenario B (More engineering, Offsite Lab costs). → `24-month-budget-DRAFT.md`
3. **Refine Pitch Deck Narrative:** Incorporate the "Complexity Gap" and "Accelerated Learning" story. → `investor-materials.md`
4. **Prepare Mentor Questions:** Focus on the leap from $1.5M to $2.5M validity.

**Owner:** Jeff Violo
**Support:** MBA Student (Max Zhang - SaaS/Infra multiples), Mentors (budget validation)

## Session Insights

### 2025-11-22: Pilot Pricing as Revenue Proof Point
**Key Realizations:**
1. **Cost Recovery Pricing for Pilots:** Pilot priced at cost recovery (zero margin) to prove value. This makes the 50% grant matching even more compelling for operators.
2. **Pilot Deliverables = Revenue Template:** The 4 deliverable categories (Readiness Baseline, Operational Intelligence, ROI Validation, Future Project Intelligence) become the template for annual contract pricing.
3. **Expansion ROI Projections:** Including "if we deploy to Sites B, C, D" projections in pilot deliverables primes the conversation for multi-site contracts.

**Fundraising Implications:**
- Pilot cost structure informs 24-month budget (lab costs, labor, platform setup)
- Grant matching (ERA/AI) reduces operator cost and validates non-dilutive funding thesis
- Risk reversal guarantee demonstrates confidence to investors

## Session Insights

### 2025-11-29: CDL Mentor Session 1 - Critical Integration

**Attendees:** Dave, Doug, Jocelyn, Terence, Dennis, Max (MBA)

**High-Value Feedback (Integrated into Strategy):**

1. **Benefits-Focused Materials Urgency** ✅
   - **Mentor message:** "Spoon feed us. 2-3 sentence elevator pitch + one-pager. We won't dig through docs."
   - **Luminous response:** Create tiered pitch materials (Tier 1: mentor forwarding, Tier 2: operator one-pager, Tier 3: technical validation)
   - **Action:** One-paragraph pitch + one-pager by Dec 13 (committed in follow-up email)

2. **IP Resolution is Pre-Requisite** ✅
   - **Mentor consensus:** "No investor will write a check until IP is resolved. Not an objective - it's table stakes."
   - **Luminous response:** Accelerate AU timeline from "early 2026" to Q1 2026 with business urgency
   - **Action:** IP timeline document with AU commitments by Dec 13

3. **CNRL Diversification Warning** ✅
   - **Jocelyn (direct CNRL experience):** "Hardest company to get money from. Bar none. Get everything in writing. Don't count on verbal commitments."
   - **Luminous response:** Keep CNRL warm but prioritize Suncor (Base Plant urgency) and Imperial (validation leverage)
   - **Action:** Pathways intro (Dave/Kendall Dilling), Suncor materials (Jocelyn network)

4. **Data Ownership in Pilot Agreements** ✅
   - **Doug warning:** MTAs/MSAs can auto-assign derivative IP to operators. Get legal review.
   - **Luminous response:** BLG legal review of pilot agreement template
   - **Action:** Simple pilot agreement template by Dec 20 (3 weeks per follow-up email)

**Feedback to Validate (Not Automatic Integration):**

5. **"Stop Publishing Papers"** ⚠️
   - **Mentor position:** "Zero more effort on publications. Operators don't read them."
   - **Luminous position:** Finish Kearl paper (defensive IP + regulatory credibility), but don't add new publication work
   - **Decision:** Complete in-flight publication, use strategically for AER/Indigenous validation (not sales pitch)

6. **"$260K Savings is THE Pitch"** ⚠️
   - **Mentor position:** Lead with ROI, bury environmental story
   - **Luminous position:** $260K is one scenario (Kearl configuration). Real value is "Release Readiness" (license to operate)
   - **Decision:** Reframe as "Operators at Kearl achieved $260K efficiencies. Your savings depend on configuration, but Release Readiness path is guaranteed."

7. **"Elevator Pitch Must Be 2-3 Sentences MAX"** ⚠️
   - **Mentor position:** Extreme brevity for CEO/forwarding
   - **Luminous position:** Different audiences need different depths (CEO ≠ Wetland Ops ≠ AER)
   - **Decision:** Tiered structure prevents oversimplification/commoditization

**Feedback to Question:**

8. **"Pathways Alliance Priority"** ❓
   - **Mentor offer:** Dave intro to Kendall Dilling (Pathways CEO)
   - **Luminous reality:** Pathways = policy consortium (don't run wetlands). Ty Van Ness (water monitoring) already a fan.
   - **Decision:** Accept intro for relationship-building, but don't divert from direct operator pilots

9. **"Software as Necessary Evil"** ❌
   - **Jocelyn framing:** O&G sees software as cost center
   - **Luminous reality:** We're selling regulatory compliance infrastructure (safety system), not IT software
   - **Decision:** Position as "Operational Intelligence Platform" not "monitoring software"

**Strategic Commitments (Follow-Up Email):**
