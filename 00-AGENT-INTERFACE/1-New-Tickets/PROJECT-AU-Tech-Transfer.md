**Subject:** Tech Transfer Next Steps / Marketing & MBA Opportunities

Hello ,

Thanks for the meeting earlier. Following up with a brief summary and a request for a quick meeting before the holidays.

**1. Tech Transfer Urgency:**
We want to move quickly on the pilot front with CNRL, Suncor and our fundraising round. Progressing and completing the Tech Transfer is a critical path item to unblock these milestones, so we want to know what you need us to do to advance these conversations. As discussed, we will want to go back and fourth a few times before engaging a lawyer to save on costs.

**2. Marketing Opportunity (CNRL/Joy Romero):**
We would love an introduction to your Marketing Manager. We have a strong "Homegrown Innovation" story to tell involving Luminous, AU, and CNRL, specifically linking Joy Romero (AU Board/CNRL Lead) to the origin story. This would be a win for all parties, and hopefully Joy and CNRL would be open to participating in the narrative.

**3. AU MBA Case Study:**
We also discussed the opportunity for Luminous to serve as a case study for your MBA program. We’d love to explore this with the business school when the time is right .

Do you have 30 minutes before the Christmas break to discuss these three points?

Best,
Jeff
