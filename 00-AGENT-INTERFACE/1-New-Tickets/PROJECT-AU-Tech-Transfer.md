**Subject:** Tech Transfer Next Steps / Marketing & MBA Opportunities

Hello Ramses and Alyse,

Thanks for the meeting earlier. Following up with a brief summary and a request for a quick meeting before the holidays.

**1. Tech Transfer Urgency:**
We are moving quickly on pilots with CNRL and Suncor, as well as our fundraising round, so progressing the Tech Transfer is a critical path for us. Please let us know what you need from us to advance these conversations. As discussed, we’d prefer to go back and forth a few times to align on key terms before engaging legal counsel.

**2. Marketing Opportunity (CNRL/Joy Romero):**
We would love an introduction to AU's Marketing team. We have a great "Homegrown Innovation" story involving Luminous, AU, and CNRL—specifically linking Joy Romero (AU Board/CNRL Lead) to the origin story. This is a win for all parties, and we believe Joy and CNRL would be open to participating in the narrative.

**3. AU MBA Case Study:**
We also discussed the potential for Luminous to serve as a case study for your MBA program. We’d love to explore this with the business school when the time is right.

Do you have 30 minutes before the Christmas break to discuss these three points?

Best,
Jeff
