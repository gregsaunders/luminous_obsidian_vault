Hi [Name],

Thanks for the meeting earlier. Following up with a brief summary and a request for a quick touchline before the holidays.

**1. Tech Transfer Urgency:**
We are moving quickly on the pilot front with CNRL and our fundraising round. Completing the Tech Transfer is now a critical path item to unblock these milestones.

**2. Marketing Opportunity (CNRL/Joy Romero):**
I’d like an introduction to your Marketing Manager. There is a strong "Homegrown Innovation" story here involving Luminous, AU, and CNRL—specifically linking back to Joy Romero (AU Board/CNRL Lead). This is a win for all parties, and CNRL may be open to participating in the narrative.

**3. AU MBA Case Study:**
We see an opportunity for Luminous to serve as a live case study for the AU MBA program. We’d love to explore this with the business school.

Do you have 30 minutes before the Christmas break to discuss these three points?

Best,
Jeff
