# Project: Mentor Capital & Connections Campaign

**Status:** 🟢 New
**Owner:** Jeff
**Priority:** High

## Goal
Leverage the CDL Mentor network (Dave, Doug, Jocelyn, Terence, Dennis) to:
1.  **Secure Capital:** Introductions to investors or direct investment (if applicable).
2.  **Unlock Contacts:** Warm intros to decision-makers at Oil Sands operators (CNRL, Suncor, etc.).

## Context
*   **Assets:** Luminous One-Pager, Pitch Deck (need to confirm status), Kearl Pilot Data ($260k savings).
*   **Recent Update:** Sent "Update" email on Dec 5 (highlighting priorities).

## Strategy
*   **"Spoon-fed" Outreach:** Provide mentors with exact blurbs (done in Playbook) + specific target lists.
*   **Individual Strategy:** Customize the "ask" for each mentor based on their background.

## Tasks
- [ ] Define specific "Ask" for each mentor (Capital vs. Contacts).
- [ ] Draft outreach emails/blurbs for mentors to send to *their* network.
- [ ] Schedule 1:1 strategy calls with mentors (Jan 2026).
