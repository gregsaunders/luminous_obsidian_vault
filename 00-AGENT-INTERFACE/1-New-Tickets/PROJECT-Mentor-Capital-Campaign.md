# Project: Mentor Capital & Connections Campaign

**Status:** 🟢 New
**Owner:** Jeff
**Priority:** High

## Goal
Leverage the CDL Mentor network (Dave, Doug, Jocelyn, Terence, Dennis) to:
1.  **Secure Capital:** Introductions to investors or direct investment (if applicable).
2.  **Unlock Contacts:** Warm intros to decision-makers at Oil Sands operators (CNRL, Suncor, etc.).

## Context
*   **Assets:** Luminous One-Pager, Pitch Deck (need to confirm status), Kearl Pilot Data ($260k savings).
*   **Recent Update:** Sent "Update" email on Dec 5 (highlighting priorities).

## Strategy
*   **"Spoon-fed" Outreach:** Provide mentors with exact blurbs (done in Playbook) + specific target lists.
*   **Individual Strategy:** Customize the "ask" for each mentor based on their background.

## Tasks
- [ ] Define specific "Ask" for each mentor (Capital vs. Contacts).
- [ ] Draft outreach emails/blurbs for mentors to send to *their* network.
- [ ] Schedule 1:1 strategy calls with mentors (Jan 2026).

## Draft Emails (Calgary Trip: Dec 9-12)

### 1. Jocelyn (Strategy & Messaging)
**Subject:** Calgary Coffee Next Week? / Account Strategy & Pitch

Hi Jocelyn,

I’ll be in Calgary next week (Monday–Thursday) and would love to grab a coffee if you’re around.

I’d value your brain on our account strategies for the majors (Suncor, CNRL, Imperial) and Pathways Alliance. I also want to pressure-test our pitch messaging with you to ensure it’s hitting the mark, and hear your thoughts on where you’d most like to plug in to help us win.

Are you free for a coffee? If next week is too tight, we can hop on a call the following week.

Best,
Jeff

### 2. Dave (Fundraising & Pathways)
**Subject:** Calgary Coffee Next Week? / Fundraising & Kendal Dilling

Hi Dave,

I’ll be in Calgary next week (Monday–Thursday) and would love to buy you a coffee.

I’m working through our fundraising package and would value your input. Specifically, I’d love to discuss any contacts you might have within the operators (Suncor, CNRL, Imperial), and particularly **Kendal Dilling at Pathways Alliance**.

Let me know if you have a window next week. If not, I’m happy to set up a call for the week after.

Best,
Jeff

### 3. Doug (Pilots & Terms)
**Subject:** Calgary Coffee Next Week? / Pilot Terms & Fundraising

Hi Doug,

I’ll be in Calgary next week (Monday–Thursday) and would welcome the chance to grab a coffee.

I’d love to dive into the specifics of our commercial pilot projects—specifically the terms and conditions we should be aiming for—as well as get your advice on our operator relationships and the fundraising package we’re assembling.

Do you have time to meet? If you're fully booked, let's do a virtual connect the following week.

Best,
Jeff

### 4. Terrance (Operations)
**Subject:** Calgary Coffee Next Week? / Operations Strategy

Hi Terrance,

I’ll be in Calgary next week (Monday–Thursday)—do you have time for a coffee?

I want to leverage your operations experience to ensure our detailed delivery plan is bulletproof. I’d also love to chat about where you see yourself fitting into the Luminous project and how you’d best like to contribute.

Let me know if you’re around. If not, we can find a time online the week after.

Best,
Jeff

### 5. Michael (Syncrude & Delivery)
**Subject:** Luminous / Syncrude Experience & Delivery

Hi Michael,

I know you're based in Edmonton, so I’d love to set up a virtual time to chat (unless you happen to be in Calgary next week!).

I’m keen to tap into your experience at Syncrude and discuss the operational delivery side of our solution. I’d also like to explore where you see yourself fitting into the project and how we can best utilize your expertise.

Do you have time for a call next week or the week after?

Best,
Jeff
