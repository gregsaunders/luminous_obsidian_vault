## Draft Email (Update)
**Subject:** Luminous Update: Executing on Priorities / Pilot & Funding Traction

Team,

Since our last note, we’ve been executing on the revised priorities. Here is a brief update on where we stand:

**1. CNRL Pilot (Actioned)**
We reached out to Theo and Jayne. Theo clarified that they are not directly involved with the Albian Mine, so we have requested a warm introduction to the correct site leadership. We are keeping the pressure on here.

**2. IP & Storytelling (AU & Joy Romero)**
We engaged Athabasca University to not only accelerate the Tech Transfer (Critical Path) but also to involve their marketing team. We see a strong "Homegrown Innovation" narrative linking Luminous, AU, and Joy Romero (AU Board/CNRL Exec). We want to leverage this story to grease the wheels at CNRL.

**3. Funding (Alberta Innovates Validation)**
I had a very positive conversation with Mark Doner at Alberta Innovates. We are firmly on their radar, and he confirmed that matching funds for a paid pilot are viable. This de-risks the capital ask for our pilot partners significantly.

**4. Pitch Materials (Attached)**
As promised, attached are the following for your review and use:
*   **Luminous One-Pager:** Operational benefits-focused.
*   **Pitch material:** Tools to help articulate the value proposition for introductions.

**Next Steps: Small Group Sessions**
To respect everyone's time and ensure deep focus, I will be reaching out individually to schedule smaller group sessions rather than one large meeting. I want to dive into specific strategic areas with those of you best suited to guide them.

Thanks for the continued push.

Best,
Jeff
