# Project: CNRL Pilot (Q2 2026)

**Status:** 🟡 Active
**Owner:** Jeff
**Priority:** Critical

## Goal
Secure a paid commercial pilot at CNRL Albian for Q2 2026 start.

## Context
*   **Proposal:** `03-PRODUCTS/2-Squarehead-Foundry/frameworks/pilot-Proposal-integrated-water-readiness-infrastructure-V1.7.md`
*   **Agreement:** `03-PRODUCTS/2-Squarehead-Foundry/frameworks/pilot-agreement-terms-addendum.md`
*   **Strategy:** "Cost Recovery" + "Grant Matching".

## Tasks
- [ ] Schedule meeting with Theo & Jayne (Follow-up on last meeting, CDL update, Steve Laut's comments).
- [ ] Schedule meeting with Jean Paul (Separate CDL follow-up).
- [ ] Refine Pilot Proposal (if needed).
- [ ] Finalize Pilot Agreement (Legal Review).
- [ ] Secure Grant Matching (ERA/AI).

## Latest Status
*   **Dec 05:** Theo responded (Horizon side), needs to discuss with Albian team.
*   **Action:** Push for direct intro to Albian (Johnpaul/Jason) to avoid bottlenecks.

## Communication Drafts (Ready to Send)

### 1. Reply to Theo (Clarifying the ask)
**Context:** Theo (Horizon) is asking Albian Ops. We are going to update Innovation (JP/Jason) separately.
**Goal:** Encourage Theo to do the intro, but let him know we are engaging Innovation in parallel.

> **Subject:** RE: Update on CDL week and pilot discussion
>
> Thanks Theo.
>
> Appreciate you connecting with the Albian team on this.
>
> While you coordinate that, I’m going to send a separate update to JohnPaul and Jason (Innovation) regarding the technical feedback we received at CDL. We want to ensure the specific "Operational Intelligence" value prop is on their radar for broader technology adoption.
>
> When you hear back from the Albian side, an intro to that team would be great so we can walk them through the specific operational logistics for Spring 2026.
>
> Best,
> Jeff

### 2. Email to Technology & Innovation (JohnPaul & Jason)
**Goal:** Influence CNRL to "Adopt the Technology". Focus on the Strategic Pivot & Efficiency.

> **Subject:** CDL Update: Operational Intelligence & Tech Adoption Focus
>
> Hi JohnPaul and Jason,
>
> Following up on our CDL week—we received some distinct feedback from the mentors (specifically **Steve Laut**) regarding how CNRL adopts new technology.
>
> His advice was straightforward: *"Stop selling environmental monitoring. Sell operational speed."*
>
> He highlighted that the real value for CNRL isn't just compliance—it's closing the **8-week decision lag**. You are managing complex processes, but the toxicity feedback loop is too slow to influence real-time decisions.
>
> **The Strategic Pivot:**
> We are positioning our technology not just as a sensor, but as an **Operational Intelligence** tool for the 2026 season.
> *   **The Innovation:** Closing the gap from 8 weeks to **48 hours** (validating the "Real-Time Feedback Loop").
> *   **The Impact:** Enabling operators to optimize water release strategies *during* the event.
> *   **The Opportunity:** We have identified the **Albian Wetland** as the ideal candidate to pilot this "Speed-First" model in Q2 2026.
>
> We’d love to grab 15 mins to discuss how this aligns with your Innovation roadmap and how we can support CNRL in adopting this capability next year.
>
> Best,
> Jeff
