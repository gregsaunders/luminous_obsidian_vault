## Draft Email
**Subject:** Albian Pilot / Steve Laut Feedback

Hi Theo and Jayne,

Following up on our CDL week—we received distinct positive feedback from Steve Laut regarding our approach to operationalizing biological data.

We see a clear path to launch the Albian Wetland pilot this Spring (2026). I’ve discussed this with Alberta Innovates, and we can structure this to be a low-friction, cost-neutral initiative that allows you to master the multivariate complexity of your release objectives.

Do you have 15 minutes before the holidays to discuss? We’d love to align the strategy for Q1.

Best,
Jeff
