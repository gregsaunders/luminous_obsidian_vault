**Subject:** Luminous BioSolutions / AU Spin-out & Pilot Funding

Hi Reesa,

Dr. Ramses Ilarraza and Alyse Pearce at Athabasca University mentioned that we should reach out to you regarding our startup Luminous BioSolutions.

We are the first venture to spin out of AU with a filed patent—commercializing a biosensor that solves critical toxicity monitoring lags for the oil sands industry.

I’ve recently had a productive discussion with Mark Doner here at Alberta Innovates regarding our upcoming pilot projects (aiming for Q2 2026 deployment). He indicated that our roadmap aligns well with the matching fund programs.

I’d love to connect briefly before the Christmas break to introduce our pilot strategy and ensure we’re aligned on the application process.

Do you have 15 minutes next week?

Best,
Jeff
