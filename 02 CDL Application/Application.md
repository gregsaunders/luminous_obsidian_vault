### Venture Overview

### Venture Name

Luminous BioSolutions Inc.

### What is the problem you are trying to solve with your venture and why is this problem important to solve?

The oil sands industry faces a critical challenge: managing over 1.4 trillion litres of tailings water contaminated with toxic Naphthenic Acids (NAs). This creates a multi-billion-dollar environmental liability, stalls land reclamation, and poses a significant risk to ecosystems and surrounding communities. Existing monitoring is slow and expensive, and current remediation methods struggle to meet the scale and efficacy required, creating an urgent need for a better solution.

### Provide an "elevator pitch" overview of the venture you are building to solve this problem.

Luminous BioSolutions provides an integrated platform to accelerate the remediation of oil sands tailings ponds. We use our peer-reviewed, rapid biosensors to precisely map NA contamination, then deploy targeted, nature-based bioaugmentation to enhance natural degradation. Our data platform provides real-time validation of the entire process, empowering operators to reduce environmental liabilities, meet regulatory timelines, and build a sustainable path to reclamation.

#### Venture Specifics

  
  

### Describe how your product or service works. This is best done from the perspective of a potential or actual customer. Explain the value proposition for this customer.

An oil sands operator engages with Luminous BioSolutions through a clear, phased partnership designed to enhance their existing reclamation assets, such as a constructed wetland. The customer journey is:

- **Phase 1: Baseline Assessment & Strategy.** We first deploy our rapid biosensors to create a high-resolution "NA Health Map" of the customer's specific water body. This provides, often for the first time, a clear and comprehensive baseline of contamination hotspots. Collaborating with the customer's team, we use this data to co-develop a targeted, site-specific remediation strategy and timeline.
- **Phase 2: Targeted Deployment.** We deploy our bioaugmentation solution of selected native microbial communities precisely into the wetland to accelerate the natural breakdown of NAs.
- **Phase 3: Real-Time Validation & Optimization.** Throughout the engagement, the customer has access to our Confluent data platform. They receive ongoing monitoring data that tracks remediation progress against the baseline in near real-time. 

The output is a verifiably cleaner water system and the robust data required for regulatory reporting and stakeholder transparency.

What is the value proposition for this customer? Include quantifiable metrics if possible.

Our value proposition is to transform tailings management from a slow, uncertain liability into a fast, predictable, and data-driven operation. We provide certainty and control.

- **Faster Data:** We reduce NA monitoring time from weeks to minutes, enabling real-time operational intelligence.
    
- **Smarter Remediation:** We solve the performance gap identified in recent industry research (e.g., the Kearl Wetland Report) where natural degradation rates can slow by over 50%. Our targeted bioaugmentation enhances and accelerates these proven natural processes.
    
- **Better Outcomes:** Our integrated platform provides a verifiable, low-cost "polishing step" that de-risks multi-billion-dollar reclamation plans and provides the transparent data needed to satisfy regulators and stakeholders.
    

### Who is your customer? If you do not know who your customer is yet, who do you think it might be?

We have three target customers with massive scale opportunities. Imperial Oil, Suncor, Canadian Natural Resources.

  

### What is the value proposition for this customer (i.e., What is the reason a customer will pay for your product/service?) Include quantifiable metrics if possible that highlight the value of your product/service to a customer (e.g., faster, better, etc.,).

Our value proposition is to transform tailings management from a slow, uncertain liability into a fast, predictable, and data-driven operation. We provide certainty and control.

- **Faster Data:** We reduce NA monitoring time from weeks to minutes, enabling real-time operational intelligence.
    
- **Smarter Remediation:** We solve the performance gap identified in recent industry research (e.g., the Kearl Wetland Report) where natural degradation rates can slow by over 50%. Our targeted bioaugmentation enhances and accelerates these proven natural processes.

### Who are your competitors and what differentiates your product/service from them?

Our competition includes the status quo (containment), labs using slow analytical chemistry, and standalone remediation technologies (e.g., chemical treatments).

Our differentiation is that we are an integrated enhancement platform, not a replacement.

- vs. Labs: We complement high-fidelity labs by providing rapid, affordable screening to tell them where and _when_ to use their precise tools.
- vs. Remediation Tech Unlike "blind" solutions, we use our data to see the problem, guide the remediation, and prove it’s working. We make nature-based systems like constructed wetlands smarter, faster, and more reliable at a significantly lower cost.

### Briefly explain the size of the market(s)/opportunity that you see for your business. Include metrics where possible.

Our market opportunity is uniquely concentrated and massive. We are not targeting thousands of small customers, but rather a handful of major industrial players grappling with one of the world's largest and most complex environmental challenges.  
  
Primary Market & Scale of Opportunity:  
  
Our target market consists of Alberta's largest oil sands operators, with a focus on securing foundational partnerships with Imperial Oil, Suncor, and Canadian Natural Resources. These companies collectively manage the majority of the oil sands' tailings inventory, and the scale of their problem defines our opportunity:  
  
Volume: Over 1.4 trillion litres of toxic tailings water requires active, long-term management.  
Physical Footprint: A land area greater than 300 km² is currently impacted by tailings ponds.  
Economic Liability: This represents a $30 billion to $130 billion+ environmental and financial liability that operators are under intense regulatory and investor pressure to address.  
  
Our Business Model & Market Value:  
  
Our model is to become a deeply integrated, long-term operational partner. The opportunity is not a one-time sale, but a multi-year service contract for monitoring, remediation, and data management at each site.  
  
Based on our projections, successfully integrating with these three operators represents a serviceable market of $6M to $20M in annual recurring revenue.  
Our vision is to operate and scale these solutions over the next 10 to 30 years, aligning with the long-term reclamation timelines mandated by regulators.  
  
Success with these partners will establish our platform as the industry standard, and ultimately export this Alberta-grown solution to global mining sectors facing similar critical water challenges.

#### Technology Overview

  
  

What is the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) for your core technology?

4 - Technology Stage: Laboratory Testing/Validation of MVP (Alpha Prototype)

  

### Describe the venture's core technology in non-technical terms

Our core innovation is a suite of proprietary biotechnologies that work together:

- **Living Sensors:** We've engineered harmless bacteria that act like smoke detectors for NAs. When they encounter these toxins in a water sample, they are designed to glow. More toxins, a brighter glow. This gives us an instant, easy-to-read signal.
- **Nature's Cleanup Crew:** We identify the most effective, naturally-occurring microbes already in the tailings environment—nature’s own specialists—and give them a strategic boost to dramatically accelerate the natural breakdown of NAs.

The Confluent data platform is the "mission control" that connects these two, using data from the sensors to guide the cleanup crew and track their success.

### In what specific dimension is your technology able to outperform the competition?

Our technology outperforms others in speed and efficacy because our core innovation is the biotechnology itself.

- **Speed Advantage:** This is created by the biological reaction in our sensors. They bypass the immense time delays of shipping, sample prep, and machine analysis required by labs, generating a light signal almost instantly.
    
- **Efficacy Advantage:** This comes from using our data to guide a targeted bioaugmentation. Competitors operate blindly; we use data from our sensors to deploy the right microbial solution in the right place at the right time, ensuring resources are used efficiently and the remediation is verifiably working.

### What is the most exciting data you have that validates your aforementioned technical advantage? Include any links to this data (e.g., publications) if you have them.

Our two most exciting pieces of data are both recent, peer-reviewed publications:

1. **Our Own Published Science:** Our core biosensor technology was validated and published in the world-leading journal, _**ACS Synthetic Biology**_. The study proves our sensors work effectively and sensitively (down to 1.5 mg/L) in raw, untreated OSPW samples.
    
2. **Independent Industry Validation:** The recently published **Kearl Wetland Report** provides a public, third-party validation of the problem we solve. It confirms that constructed wetlands are effective but that their NA degradation rate slows significantly over time, creating a critical performance gap that our bioaugmentation service is perfectly designed to address.

### If helpful, include written context that outlines your strategy to defend/protect your innovation either currently or into the future.

Our strategy to protect our innovation is multi layered, combining formal patent protection with trade secrets and a strong, defensible market position built around our integrated platform.  
  
1. Foundational Patent Protection (the "What")  
  
We have already established a IP foundation by filing a patent application for our core NA Biosensor technology.  
  
Filed Application: Our invention, titled "Bacterial Biosensors for Detection of Naphthenic Acids," is protected under a filed Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) application (WO/2023/039675), with corresponding applications in key jurisdictions including Canada (CA3231393A1) and the United States (US20230086835A1).  
Coverage: This foundational patent protects the novel engineered bacterial biosensors themselves—the "living sensors" designed to detect specific naphthenic acid compounds. This secures our core detection technology in the highly specific and valuable niche of Alberta's oil sands.  
  
2. Process & Platform Patents (The "How")  
  
Our strategy extends beyond protecting a single component. We recognize that our greatest value lies in our integrated workflow.  
  
Future Filings: We have a roadmap to file additional patents covering our proprietary "Detect, Record, Remediate, Detect" process.  
Coverage: This will protect the entire system and method. How our biosensors, data platform, and bioremediation service work together in a feedback loop. Protecting the full process makes it significantly more difficult for a competitor to replicate our holistic solution, even if they were to develop an alternative sensor.  
  
3. Trade Secrets & Proprietary Know-How (The "Secret Sauce")  
  
We understand that not all innovation can or should be patented. Critical operational elements that give us a competitive edge are protected as closely-guarded trade secrets. These include:  
  
- Optimized growth media formulations and culturing conditions for our bacterial sensors and remediation agents.  
- The specific data processing algorithms and machine learning models that power our analytics platform.  
- Our detailed field deployment protocols and operational best practices.  
  
4. Competitive Moat (The Integrated System & Data Advantage)  
  
Ultimately, our strongest defense is our market position, built upon the integrated nature of our platform.  
  
System Synergy: A competitor might eventually replicate a single piece of our system, but our true defensibility comes from the seamless integration of all three parts. The value is in the synergy between the sensor, the data platform, and the remediation service.  
Proprietary Data Set: As we deploy our solution, we will build an unparalleled proprietary data set on NA concentrations and remediation dynamics in tailings ponds. This data will be used to continuously train and improve our predictive AI models, making our platform smarter and more effective over time. This creates a virtuous cycle and a significant data barrier that new entrants cannot easily overcome.

  

### Do you have a working prototype that can be demonstrated?

  

As part of the admissions process, a CDL-affiliated scientist may be asked to assess the science or technology at the core of your venture. Please briefly describe (in point form) the type of scientist or technology expert that you believe would be best suited to understand and assess your core technology.

An Environmental Microbiologist with specific expertise in the biodegradation of hydrocarbons, particularly Naphthenic Acids (NAs) in the context of the oil sands.

An Environmental Chemist or Water Quality Specialist with deep experience in the complex matrix of Oil Sands Process Affected Water (OSPW).  
  
Their expertise is crucial for evaluating the performance and resilience of our technology. They can validate our biosensors' specificity against potential chemical interferents and understand the impact of the harsh OSPW environment (e.g., salinity, pH) on our biological systems.  
  
A Bioprocess or Environmental Engineer with experience in scaling bioremediation systems from the lab to the field.  
  
This expert would understand the practical challenges and assess the viability of our strategy for mass producing bacterial cultures, our bioreactor concepts, and our plans for deployment and operational management at an industrial scale.  
  
A specialist in Synthetic Biology would also be highly valuable.  
  
Given that our biosensors are engineered bacteria, an expert in synthetic biology would fully appreciate the novelty of the genetic circuits designed for NA detection and the innovation involved in creating these "living sensors".

  

### Is machine learning or artificial intelligence a part of the core technology?

Yes

  
### Which prediction problem(s) do you intend to address by using machine learning? (Select all that apply)

Forecasting;Simulation;Visualization

  
### Describe the machine-learning problem you are solving. Please include a brief description of the core methods or technologies used, inputs, outputs, and approach to validation.

The machine-learning problem we are solving is to transform vast amounts of environmental data into predictive and prescriptive intelligence. Our goal is to move beyond simply reporting what NA levels are today, and instead forecast what they will be in the future, identify risks before they emerge, and recommend the most efficient actions to take.  
  
This allows us to answer critical questions for operators, such as: "Which areas of my pond are at highest risk of increasing contamination?" and "Where should I focus my remediation efforts for the biggest impact?"  
  
Here is a breakdown of our approach:  
  
Core Technology:  
  
Our data and machine learning platform, internally named Confluent, is built on TerminusDB.  
We chose TerminusDB, a graph database, because it excels at modeling the complex, interconnected relationships in our data, linking every sample point to its specific time, 3D location, chemical signature, and subsequent remediation actions. This creates a rich, queryable knowledge graph of the pond's entire history and health, which is ideal for sophisticated machine learning.  
  
Inputs to the Model:  
  
Primary Sensor Data: Real-time NA concentration data from our biosensors.  
Spatio-temporal Metadata: The precise timestamp, GPS coordinates, and depth for every single data point.  
Environmental Parameters: Additional data collected during sampling, such as water temperature, pH, and dissolved oxygen.  
Operational Data: Records of when and where our bioremediation "cleanup crews" are deployed.  
  
Outputs of the Model:  
  
Predictive Heat Maps: A visual forecast of NA concentrations across the entire pond for future time periods (e.g., 7, 30, or 90 days out).  
Proactive Risk Alerts: Identification of "hotspot" zones that exceed acceptable NA thresholds, allowing for preemptive action.  
Optimized Remediation Plans: Recommendations for the most effective locations to deploy our bioremediation agents to maximize their impact.  
Efficacy Validation: Clear reports comparing the actual NA degradation in a treated area against the model's prediction, providing verifiable proof of our remediation effectiveness.  
  
Approach to Validation:  
  
We will use rigorous, industry-standard machine learning validation techniques. Our data set will be split into training and testing sets.  
The model will be trained on the historical data and then tested on its ability to accurately predict outcomes in the "unseen" test data.  
  
We will measure the model's predictive accuracy using standard metrics like Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to determine how close our forecasts are to real-world measurements. This continuous validation process ensures our models are not just theoretically sound but are proven to be accurate and reliable in the field.
