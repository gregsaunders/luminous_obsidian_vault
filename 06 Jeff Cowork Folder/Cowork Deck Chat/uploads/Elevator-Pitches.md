# Luminous BioSolutions: Elevator Pitches

**Version:** 4.0 (Velocity Update) **Updated:** November 2025

### 1. TWO-SENTENCE PITCH (Written)

Oil sands operators are facing a 2027 regulatory deadline to release water, but they currently lack the data to prove it's safe. Luminous provides the **"Readiness Infrastructure"**—a 24-hour Biosensor and Context Engine—that builds the defensible toxicity baseline they need to secure their License to Release.

### 2. THIRTY-SECOND PITCH (Verbal)

[The Hook] Operators have a $30 Billion liability sitting in tailings ponds. They have 18 months to figure out how to release it before new regulations drop in 2027.

[The Solution] Luminous builds the infrastructure to solve this. We deploy a **"Mine Detector"** (24-hour Biosensor) that identifies toxicity in real-time, and a **"Map"** (Context Engine) that proves to regulators the water is safe.

[The Velocity] We've validated this at Imperial Kearl, finding $260k/year in efficiencies. We are raising **$2.5M** to deploy our "Offsite Lab" model, allowing us to onboard pilots immediately without site access delays.

### 3. EMAIL INTRODUCTION (Cold Outreach)

**Subject:** Re: 2027 Readiness & Operational Efficiency

Hi [Name],

As the 2027 Release Guidelines approach, the gap between "Forensic Data" (HRMS, 6 weeks) and "Operational Reality" (Daily) is becoming a critical risk.

Luminous BioSolutions closes this gap. We provide the **Readiness Infrastructure** required to build your defensible toxicity baseline.

We combine a **3-Panel Biosensor** (TRL 8, validated at Kearl) with a **Relational Context Engine** that automatically correlates toxicity spikes to your weather and flow data.

**The Business Case (Validated at Kearl):**

1. **Speed of Learning:** Detect process failures in 72 hours, not 6 weeks.
    
2. **Efficiency:** **$260k/year savings** via seasonal extension and flow optimization.
    
3. **Compliance:** Builds the "Glass Box" audit trail required for 2027.
    

**Zero-Friction Pilot:** We use an **Offsite Lab** model. You ship samples; we provide the dashboard. No site access permits or IT integration required.

Are you open to a 30-minute review of the Kearl data?

Best regards,

Jeff Violo COO | Luminous BioSolutions
