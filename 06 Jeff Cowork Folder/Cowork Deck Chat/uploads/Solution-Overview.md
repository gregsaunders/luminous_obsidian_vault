# Luminous BioSolutions: Solution Overview

**A Three-Tier Intelligence System for Water Release Readiness**

## The Core Proposition

We solve the **Time-to-Decision** problem.

- **Old Way:** Send samples to lab -> Wait 6 weeks -> Guess what happened.
    
- **Luminous Way:** Sensor detects change -> Context Engine correlates cause -> Act in 72 hours.
    

## The Three-Tier Architecture

### Tier 1: Compliance (HRMS)

- **Role:** The "Judge."
    
- **Function:** Provides legally defensible, high-resolution verification.
    

### Tier 2: Operational Control (The Diagnostic Suite)

- **Role:** The "Headlights."
    
- **Function:** A patent-pending 3-Panel Biosensor (TRL 8).
    
    - **Panel 2:** **Toxic Fraction (The Regulatory Key).**
        
    - **Frequency:** Daily/Weekly.
        

### Tier 3: Operational Intelligence (The Relational Context Engine)

- **Role:** The "Brain."
    
- **Function:** A specialized data platform that ingests Tier 1 and Tier 2 data and contextualizes it.
    
    - **Multivariate Correlation:** Links Bio + Chem + Physics.
        
    - **Plain Text Analytics:** Query in English ("Show me toxicity trends vs. temperature").
        
    - **Glass Box Audit Trail:** Immutable record for Regulators.
        

## Implementation: The Velocity Model

**Phase 1: Offsite Intelligence (Pilot)**

- Samples shipped to Luminous Lab (Calgary).
    
- Data pushed to Cloud Dashboard.
    
- **Goal:** Validate ROI ($260k efficiency) & Build Baseline.
    

**Phase 2: Onsite Infrastructure (Scale)**

- Hardware deployed to site (containerized).
    
- Real-time SCADA integration.
    
- **Goal:** 2027 Regulatory Release Authorization.
