## Executive Summary

Constructed treatment wetlands reduce Oil Sands Process-Affected Water (OSPW) toxicity **far faster than they reduce total naphthenic acid mass**. By Day 42 of treatment at the Kearl pilot wetland, water containing ~50 mg/L of Naphthenic Acid Fraction Compounds (NAFCs) was effectively non-toxic to fathead minnow embryos—despite literature suggesting LC50 values of 18-34 mg/L for this species.

This "Concentration Paradox" indicates that wetlands preferentially remove the most toxic, high-carbon, lipophilic compounds first, leaving behind oxidized, less bioavailable compounds. The implication is significant: **total NAFC concentration alone may be an inadequate measure of environmental safety**, and future regulatory frameworks may need to consider molecular composition and toxicity-based metrics.

## Part 1: Background & Context

### The Scale of the Problem

The Athabasca Oil Sands region in northern Alberta contains approximately 1.8 trillion barrels-of-oil equivalent, with an estimated 315 billion barrels recoverable. The extraction process has generated approximately 1.4 billion cubic metres of tailings on the landscape, including roughly 400 million cubic metres of process-affected water.

This water is toxic to fish and invertebrates and cannot currently be released to the environment. The region is naturally 50-60% wetlands by area, and successful mine reclamation requires detoxifying and integrating this water into restored landscapes.

### What Are Naphthenic Acid Fraction Compounds?

**Classic Naphthenic Acids (NAs)** follow the formula CnH2n+ZO2. These aliphatic carboxylic acids are the primary organic toxicants in oil sands tailings, present at concentrations of 60-120 ppm.

**Broader NAFCs** include nitrogen-, sulphur-, and poly-oxygen-containing compounds, some with aromatic structures. These compounds exhibit surfactant properties ("soap-like" behaviour), which is theorized to play a role in their toxic mechanism through membrane disruption. Aromatic and unsaturated acids can absorb UV light, promoting photolysis, and some NAFCs are structurally similar to fatty acids, making them bioavailable for metabolism and assimilation.

### Why Treatment Wetlands?

Among the various treatment strategies available—passive approaches like biodegradation and pit lakes, or active methods like ozonation and electro-oxidation—treatment wetlands offer a semi-passive option that has demonstrated efficacy at both mesocosm and pilot scale. They are scalable, relatively low-cost, can be hybridized with other technologies, and leverage natural processes including plant uptake, microbial degradation, and photolysis.

### Analytical Methodology

The research team at Environment & Climate Change Canada (Saskatoon) analyzed NAFCs using loop-injection Orbitrap mass spectrometry. This high-throughput method generates approximately 10 MB of data per sample in about one minute per injection, enabling semi-quantitation of NAFCs and formula-level mixture characterization. The method does not include isomer separation, which limits the ability to identify specific toxic compounds within formula classes.

## Part 2: Mesocosm Experiments

### Experiment 1: The Role of Plants

The first greenhouse experiment compared lab process water (a briny solution without NAFCs serving as a control), OSPW in unplanted mesocosms, and OSPW with _Carex aquatilis_ (water sedge).

The results showed minimal change in the control water over 82 days. Unplanted OSPW mesocosms showed some decrease in NAFCs (from approximately 90 mg/L to 60 mg/L), but high variance prevented statistical significance—nonetheless indicating that microbial activity contributes to degradation even without plants. The planted systems achieved the greatest decreases, dropping from approximately 80 mg/L to 20 mg/L over the same period.

At the molecular level, both planted and unplanted systems showed small decreases in O2 and SO3 formulae with corresponding increases in O3 and O4 formulae, though planted systems showed slightly greater O2 removal.

### Experiment 2: The Role of Temperature

The second experiment tested two temperature regimes (10°C day/5°C night versus 20°C day/10°C night) across three vegetation conditions: unplanted, _Scirpus microcarpus_, and _Triglochin maritima_. Plant density was 12 plants per approximately 300 litres, or about 25 litres per plant.

A notable finding was that **all treatments converged to the same endpoint concentration** (approximately 55% of the initial OSPW concentration) regardless of temperature or plant presence. The treatment rate in unplanted conditions was approximately -0.4 mg/L per day.

A distinct spike in NAFC concentration occurred in all warm-temperature treatments around Day 16, regardless of vegetation. The researchers hypothesized this may reflect enhanced mobilization of NAFCs from soil at higher temperatures—consistent with the "soap-like" properties of these compounds that cause them to mobilize rather than adsorb to soil particles.

The heteroatom trends were consistent across all treatments: approximately 0.2% decrease in O2 formulae per day, with corresponding increases in O3 and O4 formulae and emergence of the O5 class. Importantly, this rate of oxidation exceeded the rate of passive NAFC oxidation observed when OSPW ages in storage, indicating active transformation processes in the wetland systems.

### Mesocosm Summary

Across both experiments, concentrations decreased in all wetland setups over time, sometimes with greater decreases in planted systems. Formula class trends were consistent: O2 formulae decreased while O3, O4, and O5 formulae increased. At the formula feature level, the highest-carbon, most saturated formulae showed preferential decreases, and the average carbon number of O2 formulae decreased over time.

## Part 3: Kearl Field Wetland

### System Configuration

Imperial Oil's Kearl treatment wetland in northern Alberta operates as a four-bay system with a forebay area, shallow zones (0.4 metres depth), and deep pools (1.7 metres depth). Recirculating pumps move water at approximately 6 litres per second, targeting a 14-day recirculation rate. The system holds approximately 8,772 cubic metres when filled.

### 2021 Season: Establishing Baseline Understanding

The 2021 season was limited by operational challenges—pumps shut down by Day 45 due to low water levels caused by evapotranspiration—and by the absence of major ion data that would have allowed correction for water loss.

Despite these limitations, an important finding emerged: even though water loss should have concentrated the NAFCs, concentrations remained steady at 42-47 mg/L. This indicated that **degradation was occurring at a rate roughly equal to water loss**. Examination of heteroatom trends revealed an effective 10-12% decrease in classic naphthenic acids (O2 class) that was masked by the steady total concentration. The trends aligned with mesocosm studies: decreasing O2 and O3S formulae, increasing O3 and O4 formulae, and elimination of O3S formulae within detection limits.

### 2022 Season: Quantifying Degradation Rates

The 2022 season provided the most robust kinetic data. Major ion tracking enabled evapotranspiration correction using chloride normalization, and the treatment period extended to 98 days with two top-up additions to maintain pump operation.

Degradation occurred in two distinct phases. During Period 1 (Days 0-15), rapid removal occurred at **-0.532 mg/L per day** (regression: y = 63.1 − 0.532x, R² = 0.43). During Period 2 (Days 30-69), removal slowed to **-0.248 mg/L per day** (regression: y = 54.4 − 0.248x, R² = 0.50). The slowdown may reflect seasonality, the influence of OSPW additions, preferential removal of the most labile compounds leaving a recalcitrant fraction, or some combination of these factors.

Principal component analysis revealed consistent chronological separation of chemical profiles from Day 0 to Day 98 across all wetland cells, with 73.7% of variance explained by the first principal component. Statistical analysis of formula-level changes showed that the highest carbon number O2 formulae were selectively removed, with notable decreases among plausibly-aromatic formulae at carbon numbers 15-19 and double bond equivalents of 6-8. Interestingly, some gains occurred among low-carbon-number O2 formulae, suggesting degradation may "chip away" at larger molecules to form smaller ones. Broad gains occurred across O3, O4, and O5 formula classes.

Shallow areas showed greater oxidized content in winter/spring runoff residue, possibly reflecting plant influences, greater biofilm-colonizable surface area, or dilution effects.

### 2024 Season: Integrating Toxicity Data

Degradation trends continued in 2024, with rates of approximately -0.3 mg/L per day during Days 0-42 and approximately -0.15 mg/L per day during Days 45-128—consistent with previous seasons.

A notable anomaly emerged: **Shallow Area 5 behaved independently** from the rest of the system, starting and ending with different O2 formulae proportions and not following the same trajectory as other cells. Discussion with Imperial Oil personnel revealed that sedimentation had likely created preferential flow pathways that physically isolated this area. This represents both an ongoing management challenge and a critical design consideration for future treatment wetlands.

## Part 4: Toxicity Results

### Test Methodology

Joanne Parrott's laboratory at the Aquatic Contaminants Research Division in Burlington conducted 6-day embryo-to-hatch tests using fathead minnow (_Pimephales promelas_) embryos. The protocol used 2 mL of solution per embryo with daily solution changes and 24 fertilized eggs per plate. Endpoints measured included mortality, time-to-hatch, successful hatch rate, viable fry percentage, deformity rates, and length-at-hatch.

### Survival Results

The toxicity reduction was dramatic. At Day 0, survival ranged from only 2% to 33%—highly toxic conditions. By Day 14 (one complete circulation), survival reached approximately 50%, representing an empirical LC50. By Day 28 (two circulations), survival approached 80-90%, near negative control levels. By Day 42 (three circulations), survival exceeded 90% and was **equivalent to negative controls**—the water was effectively non-toxic.

### Sublethal Effects

Deformity rates followed similar trajectories. The proportion of embryos showing any deformity dropped from 40-90% at Day 0 to approximately 15-20% (control range) by Day 42. Severe deformities dropped from 15-65% at Day 0 to near zero by Day 28-42.

## Part 5: The Concentration Paradox

### The Core Finding

At Day 42, when the water was effectively non-toxic, the total NAFC concentration remained approximately **50 mg/L**. This presents a paradox: literature values for fathead minnow LC50 range from 18-34 mg/L, and fractionation-derived estimates suggest 4-25 mg/L. The treated water should have been lethal, yet it was not.

### Applying Predictive Toxicity Models

The Hughes model predicts naphthenic acid toxicity based on carbon chain length, following the relationship: LC50 = e^(11.06 − [0.591 × carbon number]) mg/L. The underlying principle is that longer carbon chains confer greater lipophilicity and therefore greater toxicity through membrane disruption.

Previous work using this model found an LC50 of 2.6 toxic units for fathead minnows. In the Kearl study, 50% mortality occurred at approximately 5.5 toxic units—meaning the water was **approximately 2-2.5 times less toxic than the model predicted** for that NAFC concentration.

### Explaining the Paradox

The evidence suggests that wetlands preferentially remove the most toxic compounds first. The highest-carbon O2 formulae showed the largest decreases, and aromatic structures (carbon numbers 15-19, DBE 6-8) were notably reduced. The remaining NAFCs are increasingly oxidized (O3, O4 classes) and less bioavailable.

The dominant toxicity paradigm for naphthenic acids is general narcosis through membrane disruption—compounds partition to phospholipids and compromise membrane integrity. Longer carbon chains mean greater lipophilicity, greater partitioning, and greater toxicity. However, work by Marcus Brinkman at the University of Saskatchewan Toxicology Centre on rainbow trout gill cells has demonstrated that non-trivial active transport also occurs across cell membranes, indicating the mechanism is not purely passive partitioning.

The compounds that are most toxic (high-carbon, lipophilic, membrane-permeable) are also likely the most bioavailable to microbes and the most readily assimilated by plants. Doug Muench's carbon-14 labelling studies have shown that the straightest chain, most aliphatic, longest compounds have the greatest uptake and assimilation into plant tissues. This creates a situation where the "bad actors" are removed first through multiple pathways, leaving behind a residual mixture that, while still containing significant NAFC mass, is far less toxic.

## Part 6: Insights from the Question Period

### On the Hughes Toxicity Model

The Hughes model was developed using Shell's OSPW (Shell has since left the oil sands region) and has never been tested on other OSPW sources. The presenters acknowledged that the model doesn't capture all variability in the data and has an intuitive limitation: toxicity cannot increase indefinitely with carbon number because at some point solubility decreases and compounds drop out of solution. Despite these limitations, plotting toxic units against survival shows decent correlation, suggesting the model is useful even if not comprehensively accurate.

### On Plant Uptake Versus Biodegradation

The answer is "yes and"—both processes occur simultaneously. Doug Muench's labelled compound studies demonstrate plant uptake and assimilation, with the longest, most aliphatic compounds showing greatest uptake. Yet unplanted systems still show degradation, indicating bacteria and biofilms play a substantial role. No mass balance was performed in the current study, but follow-up work with labelled compounds is underway.

### On the Contribution of Bacteria

Microbial degradation is clearly important. In Mesocosm Experiment 2, unplanted soil-water systems achieved similar NAFC removal to some planted systems, and biofilm mats in wetlands are likely very significant contributors. Later experiments (not yet published) show more consistently greater decrease rates in planted versus unplanted systems, but both show activity.

### On Oxidized NAFC Toxicity

Some literature suggests that oxidized NAFCs (O3 and higher) may be more toxic than classic O2 naphthenic acids. The presenters noted that despite increases in O3 and O4 formulae, overall toxicity decreased—partly because total mass was decreasing throughout treatment ("the dose makes the poison"). They also suggested that oxidation products from oil spills may behave differently than those from bitumen, which has already undergone significant geological degradation during its migration through the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin.

### On the Treatment Rate Slowdown

The hypothesis is that the most labile, most bioavailable compounds are removed first, leaving a recalcitrant remainder. The compounds that penetrate membranes most easily (making them most toxic) are also most accessible to microbial uptake. This could explain both the observed toxicity decrease and the kinetic slowdown. The presenter characterized this as "spitballing"—the Orbitrap data depth is insufficient to prove this definitively.

## Part 7: Conclusions & Implications

### Treatment Efficacy

Treatment wetlands work effectively at both laboratory (greenhouse) and pilot (field) scale, consistently reducing NAFC concentrations and shifting chemical profiles toward lower molecular weight, oxidized forms.

### Consistent Molecular Trends

Across all systems studied, the research found decreasing total NAFC concentrations, decreasing proportion of O2-NAFCs (classic naphthenic acids), decreasing molecular weight of non-polar formulae, elimination of O3S formulae within detection limits, and increasing proportions of O3, O4, and O5 formulae (oxidation products).

### The Role of Plants

Planted systems are often more effective than unplanted systems, likely through a combination of direct uptake of aliphatic compounds and provision of surface area for microbial biofilms. However, unplanted systems still show degradation, and the optimal plant species have not yet been determined. Further optimization work is needed.

### The Role of Temperature

Temperature had minimal effect on treatment endpoints in mesocosm studies, though it may affect kinetics and mobilization phenomena. The relationship to sorption, solubility, and bioavailability requires further characterization.

### Design Considerations

The Shallow Area 5 anomaly demonstrates that sedimentation management is critical—preferential flow pathways can isolate portions of the wetland, reducing treatment effectiveness. Evapotranspiration must be accounted for in performance monitoring, and the 14-day recirculation cycle appears effective for the Kearl system configuration.

### Treatment Rate Ranges

Across the various systems studied, treatment rates ranged from approximately -0.15 mg/L per day (Kearl slow phase) to -0.5 mg/L per day (Kearl rapid phase), with mesocosm unplanted systems achieving approximately -0.4 mg/L per day.

### The Central Regulatory Insight

**Toxicity decreases much faster than total NAFC concentration implies.** Regulatory frameworks based solely on total NAFC concentration may be inadequate for assessing environmental safety. Future approaches might consider molecular composition metrics (such as O2 versus O3+ ratios), direct toxicity testing, carbon number distribution analysis, or bioavailability-weighted concentrations.

### Future Work Needed

Several questions remain for future research: establishing the causal links between molecular changes and toxicity reduction, conducting mass balance studies to quantify the relative contributions of uptake, degradation, and transformation, optimizing plant species selection, performing isomer-level analysis to identify specific toxic compounds, developing biosensors for real-time monitoring, and refining predictive models for different OSPW sources.
