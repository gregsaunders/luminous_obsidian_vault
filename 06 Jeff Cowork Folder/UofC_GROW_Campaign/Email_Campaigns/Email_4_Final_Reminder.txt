EMAIL BODY:

Hi [First Name],

This is your final reminder—**Dr. Shawn Lewenza presents our naphthenic acid biosensor technology this Wednesday, March 5th** at the University of Calgary GROW seminar.

If you've been following our campaign over the past three weeks, you've heard about:
✓ The technology (bacterial biosensors engineered from tailings pond bacteria)
✓ The results (validated on 24 real OSPW samples with detection limits of 1.5-15 mg/L)
✓ The intelligence platform (Relational Context Engine for predictive monitoring)

Now it's time to see it all come together.

**About Dr. Shawn Lewenza**

Dr. Lewenza is Luminous BioSolutions' Chief Science Officer and the lead scientist behind our biosensor technology. His background:
• Professor at Athabasca University & University of Calgary
• Published researcher in microbiology and synthetic biology (ACS Synthetic Biology, 2024)
• Collaborated on the University of Calgary GROW project testing biosensors in constructed wetlands
• 20+ years of experience in Pseudomonas genetics and environmental microbiology

He's not just a researcher—he's the scientist who isolated bacteria from Alberta tailings ponds and engineered them into precision analytical tools.

**What You'll Learn Wednesday:**

🔬 **The Science**: How we identified NA-inducible genes and built biosensor constructs
📊 **The Data**: Complete GROW wetland trial results—no marketing spin, just data
🏭 **The Application**: How this integrates into oil sands operations
💰 **The Economics**: Cost comparison vs. traditional monitoring methods
🤝 **Q&A**: Your questions answered directly by Dr. Lewenza

📅 **Wednesday, March 5, 2026**
⏰ **[TIME]**
📍 **Virtual - [REGISTRATION LINK]**

**This is Your Last Chance to Register**

Seating is limited (virtual capacity constraints), and we've had strong interest from:
• Oil sands operators (Imperial, Suncor, CNRL, Cenovus)
• Environmental consultants and engineering firms
• Academic researchers from across Canada
• Regulatory bodies (AER, ECCC)

Don't miss the opportunity to see breakthrough technology that could transform how you monitor OSPW.

[REGISTER NOW - FINAL CALL]

We're looking forward to seeing you there.

Best regards,
