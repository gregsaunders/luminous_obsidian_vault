EMAIL BODY:

Hi [First Name],

Last week I told you about our naphthenic acid biosensor technology. This week, I want to share what happened when we actually put it to the test.

**The Real-World Challenge**

Working with the University of Calgary's GROW project (Genomics Research for Optimizing Constructed Treatment Wetlands), we faced a critical question:

Could bacterial biosensors actually replace expensive mass spectrometry for monitoring naphthenic acids in oil sands process water?

**What We Did**

Dr. Shawn Lewenza and our team tested our biosensor panel on:
• 24 OSPW samples from Alberta tailings ponds
• NAFC extracts (naphthenic acid fraction compounds)
• Direct water samples with minimal dilution

We used three different biosensor types (atuA, marR, and 3680 promoters)—each engineered to detect different classes of NA compounds.

**The Results That Surprised Us**

✓ **Detection in 22 of 24 raw water samples** using just two biosensors
✓ **Sensitivity down to 1.5 mg/L** for the custom 9xNA mixture
✓ **Compound-specific fingerprinting** - each biosensor responded to different NA types:
   • atuA: Acyclic NAs (straight chain carboxylic acids)
   • marR: Complex/aromatic NAs and fusaric acid
   • 3680: Simple cyclic NAs

✓ **Dose-dependent responses** - reliable quantification, not just yes/no detection

**Why This Matters for Your Operations**

Traditional HRMS/Orbitrap analysis is expensive, slow, and requires extensive sample prep. Our biosensors:
• Cost a fraction of mass spectrometry
• Deliver results in hours, enabling real-time decision-making
• Work with minimal sample preparation
• Provide NA compound class information (not just total concentration)

**See the Data Yourself - March 5th GROW Presentation**

Dr. Lewenza will walk through the complete GROW wetland trial results, including:
• Detection limit curves for all biosensor types
• Head-to-head comparisons with HRMS data
• Real-world operational scenarios
• Q&A on implementation in your facilities
