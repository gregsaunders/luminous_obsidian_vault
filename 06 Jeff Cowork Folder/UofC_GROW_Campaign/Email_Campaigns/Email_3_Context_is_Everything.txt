SUBJECT LINE: Beyond detection: How the Relational Context Engine turns biosensor data into operational intelligence

PREVIEW TEXT: Your current monitoring tells you what happened yesterday. Our platform predicts what happens tomorrow.

Hi [First Name],

Two weeks ago, I introduced you to our naphthenic acid biosensor technology.

Last week, I shared the GROW wetland trial results—real data from 24 OSPW samples.

This week, I want to show you how we turn biosensor data into something far more valuable: **operational intelligence**.

**The Problem with Point-in-Time Monitoring**

Traditional OSPW monitoring (whether HRMS or biosensors) gives you a snapshot:
• "On Tuesday, NA concentration was 85 mg/L in Pond 3."

That's useful. But it's not enough to make proactive decisions.

**What if you knew:**
• How NA levels are trending across multiple ponds?
• Which treatment processes are degrading which NA compound types?
• When to adjust wetland flow rates based on predicted NA loading?
• How current conditions compare to historical patterns that preceded compliance issues?

That's where our **Relational Context Engine (RCE)** comes in.

**Context-Aware Monitoring: Data + Relationships + Intelligence**

The RCE platform integrates:
✓ Real-time biosensor data (NA detection across compound classes)
✓ Operational parameters (flow rates, treatment processes, wetland conditions)
✓ Historical trends and patterns
✓ Environmental conditions (temperature, microbial activity, seasonal factors)

Then it delivers:
→ **Predictive insights**: "Based on current NA loading and wetland microbial activity, expect treatment efficiency to decline 15% over the next 72 hours unless flow is adjusted."

→ **Root cause analysis**: "Elevated acyclic NAs in Pond 2 correlate with Process A upset event 48 hours ago—not Pond 1 discharge as initially suspected."

→ **Optimization recommendations**: "NA degradation in Wetland Cell 3 is optimal—replicate conditions in Cells 1 and 2 to improve overall system performance."

**This is How AllSands Operations Will Work**

You don't just want to know NA levels. You want to:
• Optimize treatment processes in real-time
• Minimize compliance risk before it becomes an issue
• Reduce monitoring costs while improving data quality
• Make data-driven decisions with confidence

The biosensor gives you the data. The RCE gives you the intelligence.

**See It in Action - March 5th Presentation**

Dr. Shawn Lewenza will demonstrate:
• How biosensor + RCE integration works
• Real examples from GROW wetland monitoring
• Implementation pathways for your operations
• Live Q&A on technical and operational considerations

This is more than monitoring technology. It's a new way of managing OSPW.

Looking forward to sharing it with you,
