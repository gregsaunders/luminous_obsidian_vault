EMAIL BODY:

Hi [First Name],

What if you could detect naphthenic acids in oil sands process water in hours instead of weeks—at a fraction of the cost of HRMS?

That's exactly what we've developed at Luminous BioSolutions.

**From Tailings Pond Bacteria to Breakthrough Technology**

Our Chief Science Officer, Dr. Shawn Lewenza, isolated bacteria from Alberta tailings ponds and engineered them into precision biosensors that detect toxic naphthenic acids in real-time.

The results? Published in ACS Synthetic Biology (September 2024) and field-validated through the University of Calgary's GROW project.

**The Numbers That Matter:**
• Detection limits: 1.5-15 mg/L across different NA compound types
• Tested on 24 real OSPW samples from active tailings ponds
• Minimal sample preparation (90 μL direct testing—no organic extraction required)
• Results in hours, not days

**Join Us at the GROW Seminar - March 5, 2026**

Dr. Lewenza will present our biosensor technology and GROW wetland monitoring results at the University of Calgary's GROW seminar series.

📅 Date: Wednesday, March 5, 2026
⏰ Time: [INSERT TIME]
📍 Location: Virtual ([INSERT REGISTRATION LINK])

**What You'll Learn:**
• How we engineered three biosensor types (atuA, marR, 3680 promoters) to detect different NA compound classes
• Real data from constructed wetland trials
• How this changes the economics of OSPW monitoring
• Integration pathways with your existing operations

This isn't theoretical lab work—this is proven technology ready for deployment.
