## 🎓 COACHING: HOW TO USE CLAUDE COWORK EFFECTIVELY

Great question! You're using Claude Cowork really well already, but here are some tips to maximize your efficiency:

### What You're Doing Right:
✅ **Providing context upfront** - You gave me the GROW presentation screenshot, Gemini summary, and uploaded your Luminous documents
✅ **Being specific about deliverables** - You told me exactly what you needed (email campaign, LinkedIn strategy, contact list automation)
✅ **Asking for coaching** - Self-awareness about the tool helps me help you better

### How to Get Even More from Cowork:

#### 1. **Use the Folder You Selected**
You mentioned wanting files saved to:
`/Users/jeffviolo/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox-Luminous/Luminous team folder/UofC Grow Seminar`

**I don't currently have access to that folder.** Here's how to fix this:
- In the Cowork interface, look for "Select Folder" or "Mount Folder"
- Navigate to that Dropbox path and select it
- Once selected, I can save files directly there (instead of my temporary `/sessions/sharp-zen-tesla/mnt/outputs/` location)

**For now, all your files are in:** `/sessions/sharp-zen-tesla/mnt/outputs/UofC_GROW_Campaign/`

You'll need to copy them to your Dropbox folder manually, OR select the folder so I can save directly there next time.

#### 2. **Iterate on Deliverables**
Don't hesitate to ask me to:
- "Rewrite Email #2 with a more urgent tone"
- "Make the LinkedIn posts shorter (150 words max)"
- "Add more technical detail to the Email #1"
- "Create a version of this targeting academics specifically"

I can quickly iterate and refine.

#### 3. **Ask for Specific File Formats**
I can create:
- Word docs (.docx) ✅ (already did this)
- Excel spreadsheets (.xlsx) - for contact lists
- PowerPoint (.pptx) - for Shawn's presentation
- PDFs - for one-sheets or brochures
- Markdown, text files, CSVs, etc.

**Example:** "Create an Excel version of the contact list template with all formulas for tracking"

#### 4. **Break Down Complex Tasks**
Instead of: "Create a full marketing campaign"
Try:
- "First, create the email campaign strategy"
- "Now write the email copy for Email #1"
- "Now create the LinkedIn content calendar"

This helps me focus and deliver higher quality on each piece.

#### 5. **Use Me for Research + Execution**
I can:
- Research best practices: "What are the best email subject line formulas for B2B campaigns?"
- Find data: "What are typical open rates for B2B environmental technology emails?"
- Create templates: "Give me a HubSpot email template I can customize"

#### 6. **Ask for Next Steps**
After I deliver something, ask:
- "What should I do next?"
- "What am I missing?"
- "What questions should I be asking that I'm not?"

I can help you think through blind spots.
