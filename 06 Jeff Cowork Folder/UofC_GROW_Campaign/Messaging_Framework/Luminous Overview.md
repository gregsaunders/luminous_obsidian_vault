## High-Frequency Naphthenic Acid Monitoring for Water Treatment Optimization

---

### The Challenge

Oil sands operators face a practical problem: managing naphthenic acid (NA) treatment with limited visibility. Current monitoring relies primarily on high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS), which delivers excellent characterization but operates on monthly or quarterly cycles. That's useful for research. It's less useful for day-to-day treatment optimization.

Meanwhile, regulators and Indigenous communities are asking for greater transparency about what's happening in treatment systems—not just periodic snapshots, but ongoing evidence that treatment is working as expected.

### What We Do

Luminous Bio Solutions provides high-frequency NA monitoring that works alongside any treatment system - wetlands, bioreactors, chemical treatment, or hybrid approaches.

**Our biosensor technology:**

- Developed over 10 years of research
- Peer-reviewed paper publishing February 2025
- Tested in multi-season Kearl wetland pilot
- Results correlate with HRMS measurements
- Technology Readiness Level 8 (deployment-ready)

**Our platform, Squarehead Foundry:**

- Correlates NA data with operational variables (temperature, flow, weather, precipitation, seasonality)
- Helps identify _why_ treatment is working or stalling
- Builds the data foundation needed for defensible release decisions

### The Measurement Gap

|Approach|Frequency|Cost|Operational Value|
|---|---|---|---|
|HRMS|Monthly/Quarterly|High|Excellent characterization|
|Biosensor|Multiple times daily|Lower|Real-time treatment insight|

These approaches complement each other. HRMS tells you exactly what compounds you're dealing with. Our biosensor tells you how treatment is progressing day-to-day.

### Why This Matters Now

Recent research (including the GROW wetland studies) shows treatment wetlands can reduce NA toxicity faster than concentration alone would predict. But capturing that benefit requires monitoring that can track what's actually happening in real time.

The industry is at a point where:

- Treatment approaches are proving effective
- Regulatory frameworks for release are developing
- Communities are asking for transparency and accountability

High-frequency monitoring helps bridge the gap between "we think this is working" and "here's the evidence."

### Our Approach

We're looking for pilot partners—organizations interested in a 12-month deployment to demonstrate value in their specific context.

**What a pilot includes:**

- Biosensor deployment at your treatment system
- Squarehead Foundry integration for data correlation
- Comparison with your existing HRMS baseline
- Documentation suitable for regulatory discussions

We believe the operational value will speak for itself.

### About Us

Luminous Bio Solutions is based in Canada. Our biosensor technology emerged from academic research and has been validated through multi-season field deployment at Kearl. Our team includes expertise in biosensor development, water treatment, and environmental monitoring.

We're not claiming to have all the answers. We're offering a tool that provides more frequent, reliable data to help operators and regulators make better-informed decisions.
