# Luminous Bio Solutions - Key Messages

## One-Liner

"We provide high-frequency naphthenic acid monitoring to help water treatment operators know what's working and when."

---

## 30-Second Version

"Treatment systems for oil sands process water are proving effective, but there's a gap between knowing something works and proving it's working consistently. Current monitoring—mostly HRMS—gives excellent characterization but operates on monthly or quarterly cycles. We've developed a biosensor that provides NA measurements multiple times daily with 24-72 hour turnaround. It's been tested over 10 years, validated against HRMS in the Kearl wetland pilot, and has a peer-reviewed paper publishing next month. We help operators move from assumptions to certainty."

## Core Messages

### 1. We complement existing monitoring, we don't replace it.

HRMS is excellent for characterization. It tells you exactly what compounds you're dealing with. Our biosensor fills a different gap—the day-to-day operational visibility that helps you understand whether treatment is performing as expected.

### 2. The technology is validated.

- 10 years of development
- Tested in multi-season Kearl wetland pilot
- Results correlate with HRMS measurements
- Peer-reviewed paper publishing February 2025
- Technology Readiness Level 8 (deployment-ready)

### 3. We work with any treatment system.

Wetlands, bioreactors, chemical treatment, hybrid approaches—our monitoring integrates with whatever treatment technology you're using. We're measurement-agnostic about how you treat water; we just help you understand whether it's working.

### 4. High-frequency data enables better decisions.

Multiple measurements per day, results in 24-72 hours. That's the difference between "we checked last month and it looked fine" and "here's what happened this week."

### 5. Squarehead Foundry provides context, not just numbers.

Our platform correlates NA data with environmental variables—temperature, flow, weather, precipitation, seasonality. The goal is to understand _why_ treatment performance changes, not just _that_ it changes.

### 6. Trust requires transparency.

Regulators and communities are asking for accountability. "Trust us, it's working" isn't sufficient anymore. Continuous monitoring data provides the evidence base for those conversations.

### 7. A credible path is emerging.

The research shows treatment approaches work. The technology to monitor them exists. We're at a point where responsible water management is technically feasible—what's needed now is the operational data to prove it.

## Proof Points

Use these facts when credibility is being assessed:

|Claim|Proof|
|---|---|
|Technology maturity|10 years of development, TRL-8|
|Field validation|Multi-season Kearl wetland pilot|
|Scientific rigor|Peer-reviewed paper (Feb 2025)|
|Accuracy|Results correlate with HRMS|
|Methodology|Whole-cell bacterial biosensor|
|Speed|Multiple tests daily, 24-72 hour results|

## Differentiator: Certainty

The core value proposition in one word: **certainty.**

Current state: Operators make treatment decisions based on periodic snapshots and assumptions about what's happening between measurements.

With Luminous: Operators have continuous data showing what's actually happening, correlated with variables that explain performance changes.

This isn't about being better than HRMS. It's about providing a different type of information—operational certainty rather than periodic characterization.

## What We're NOT Saying

Avoid these framings:

- ~~"We're disrupting HRMS"~~ → We complement it
- ~~"Revolutionary technology"~~ → Proven technology
- ~~"The only solution"~~ → A practical tool
- ~~"You need to act now"~~ → We're here when you're ready
- ~~"Trust us"~~ → Here's the evidence

---

## Audience-Specific Emphasis

**For operators:** Focus on operational visibility and decision-making. "Know what's working and when."

**For regulators:** Focus on data transparency and evidence. "Build the data foundation for defensible decisions."

**For researchers:** Focus on data access and collaboration. "High-frequency field data to complement lab studies."

**For communities:** Focus on accountability and transparency. "Continuous monitoring means continuous accountability."

## Call to Action

"We're looking for pilot partners—organizations interested in a 12-month deployment to test whether high-frequency monitoring adds value in their context. If that's relevant to what you're working on, we'd welcome a conversation."
