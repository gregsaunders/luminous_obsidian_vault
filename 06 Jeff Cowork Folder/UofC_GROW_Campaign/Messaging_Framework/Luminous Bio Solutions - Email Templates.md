**Subject:** High-frequency NA monitoring - seeking pilot partners

Hi [Name],

I'm Jeff Violo from Luminous Bio Solutions. We've developed a biosensor for naphthenic acid monitoring that we've been testing over the past 10 years, including participation in the multi-season Kearl wetland pilot.

The short version: our technology provides NA measurements multiple times daily with results in 24-72 hours. It's designed to complement HRMS (not replace it) by filling the gap between quarterly characterization and day-to-day operations.

Our results from Kearl correlate with HRMS measurements, and we have a peer-reviewed paper publishing in February that documents the validation work.

We're looking for 1-2 pilot partners for a 12-month deployment. The goal is straightforward: demonstrate whether high-frequency monitoring adds operational value in your specific context.

If this is relevant to what you're working on, I'd be glad to share more details. If not, no worries—I appreciate your time.

## Email Template 2: Regulators / Government

**Subject:** NA monitoring technology - available for discussion

Hi [Name],

I'm reaching out because I understand [Agency/Department] is involved in developing frameworks around oil sands water treatment and potential release pathways.

Luminous Bio Solutions has developed a biosensor for naphthenic acid monitoring. The technology has been in development for 10 years, was tested in the multi-season Kearl wetland pilot, and has a peer-reviewed validation paper publishing in February.

What it does: provides NA measurements multiple times daily (24-72 hour turnaround) that correlate with HRMS results. Our platform, Squarehead Foundry, correlates this data with environmental variables like temperature, flow, and weather to help understand treatment performance.

We're not advocating for any particular regulatory approach. We're offering a monitoring tool that could help provide the data transparency that regulators and communities are asking for.

If it would be useful, I'm happy to provide a technical briefing or discuss how this might fit into emerging monitoring frameworks. If it's not relevant to your current work, I understand.

## Email Template 3: Researchers / Academic

**Subject:** Collaboration inquiry - high-frequency NA biosensor

Hi [Name],

I've been following your work on [specific research area] and wanted to reach out about a potential connection.

Luminous Bio Solutions has developed a whole-cell bacterial biosensor for naphthenic acid monitoring. We've spent 10 years on development, participated in the multi-season Kearl wetland pilot, and have validation data showing correlation with HRMS measurements. Our peer-reviewed paper publishes in February.

The technology provides multiple measurements per day with 24-72 hour turnaround. We're pairing this with a data platform (Squarehead Foundry) that correlates NA levels with environmental variables to help understand what drives treatment performance.

I'm curious whether high-frequency NA data might be useful for your research. We're also interested in learning from researchers working on related questions—understanding the mechanisms behind what we're measuring helps us build better tools.

If there's interest in a conversation, I'd welcome it. If not, I appreciate your time and wish you well with your work.

## Usage Notes

**Tone guidelines:**

- Keep it factual and direct
- State what the technology does and doesn't do
- Acknowledge limitations and uncertainty
- Make it easy for them to say no (reduces pressure, builds trust)
- Follow up once after 1-2 weeks if no response, then leave it

**Personalization:**

- Reference their specific work, facility, or research
- Mention any mutual connections
- Note any relevant recent news about their organization

**What NOT to do:**

- Don't use words like "revolutionary," "game-changing," "cutting-edge"
- Don't make promises about results before a pilot
- Don't pressure or create artificial urgency
- Don't oversell—let the technology speak through demonstration
