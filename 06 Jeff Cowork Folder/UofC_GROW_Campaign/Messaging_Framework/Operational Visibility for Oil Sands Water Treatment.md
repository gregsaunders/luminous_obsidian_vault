# From Assumptions to Certainty: Operational Visibility for Oil Sands Water Treatment

**The Challenge**

Alberta's oil sands operations hold approximately 1.4 billion cubic metres of tailings, including 400 million cubic metres of process-affected water. The primary toxin of concern is naphthenic acid - persistent, difficult to measure in complex tailings water, and toxic to aquatic life for decades if untreated.

Treatment technologies are proving effective. Constructed wetlands reduced water toxicity from lethal to fish-safe in 42 days at Imperial's Kearl pilot site. Hybrid approaches combining wetlands with other technologies show additional promise. A treatment pathway exists.

What's missing is operational certainty.

**The Monitoring Gap**

Current naphthenic acid monitoring relies on laboratory analysis, precise, but infrequent. Monthly or quarterly testing cannot tell you:

- What's happening between samples
- Why treatment is accelerating, stalling, or optimizing
- How conditions like temperature, weather, or flow affect performance
- Whether you're on track until weeks after the fact

Managing treatment systems on periodic lab data means managing on assumptions. Operators can't optimize what they can't see. Regulators can't build confidence on sparse data. Communities can't trust what isn't transparent.

**The Solution: Certainty Through Continuous Visibility**

Luminous Bio Solutions provides the operational layer for water treatment programs:

**Naphthenic Acid Biosensor** Fast, cost-effective, specific monitoring designed for the complex matrix of oil sands tailings. High-frequency testing that shows trends, not just snapshots.

**Squarehead Foundry** A relational context engine that correlates NA data with the variables that affect treatment performance - water flow, temperature, weather, precipitation, seasonality. When treatment accelerates or stalls, you know why.

**Certainty Compounds**

Each treatment season generates insights that make the next season better. Squarehead Foundry builds an operational knowledge base:

- Which conditions drive optimal performance
- What variables cause stalls
- How to anticipate and respond to changes
- Where efficiencies can be gained
- How treatment responded to anomalies like adding water to the wetland due to evaporation

This isn't static monitoring, it's a system that learns. The financial and performance impact compounds over time.

**Trust Through Transparency**

Alberta and federal governments are demanding accountability. Indigenous communities and the public need confidence that treatment is working, not assurances, but visible evidence.

Squarehead Foundry creates shared visibility. Regulators, communities, and operators can see the same data. When release decisions are made, they're made with shared certainty, not contested claims.

**Technology-Agnostic**

Our platform works with any treatment approach - wetlands, hybrid systems, or emerging technologies. We're not selling a treatment method. We're providing the monitoring and intelligence layer that makes any treatment method provable, optimizable, and trustworthy.

**The Path Forward**

A credible pathway to treating and releasing oil sands process-affected water is emerging. The science is proving out. The regulatory framework is developing. What's needed now is the operational infrastructure to manage treatment with certainty and build the trust that makes release possible.

We're ready to help.
