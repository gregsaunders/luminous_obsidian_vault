I need to get my thoughts down in regards to Luminous and all of the things we are figuring out to organize it in a way to ensure we're telling the story properly and help AI get a grasp of what I'm trying to accomplish. My goal is to throw down all of the learnings that have evolved over the last year and see how we can ensure we have a solid pitch, solution, and financial justification to participate in the monitoring and remediation of Oil Sands Wetlands. I want to capture all of my thoughts to ensure we are not missing anything, and I want to ensure that this is compelling, easy to "get" and a no brainer for Operators, regulatory and local communities and indigenous. This is in no particular order, it is more a plan to get it all down and hopefully my AI agents will help me to organize it into a better formatt.

First, there is the regulatory tailwind with the Oil Sands Mining Water Steering Committee coming up with recommendations for standard, cost-effective monitoring 4 naphthenic acid and providing transparency to all stakeholders. 

 The Alberta government has stated they want oil sands mine water tailings release guidelines in place within the next 12 to 18 months. These are important factors to consider. 

So far, the oil sands operations have been in tailings containment mode because there is no regulation for water release. As a result, they have not had any operating measures in place to both monitor and prepare water for release to the environment. 

Naphthenic acid toxicity is a particular concern for oil sands mining water for release to the environment because it is toxic to plants and animals. This needs to be monitored better as well as they need to have a remediation technique to break down the toxicity and concentrations of naphthenic acid in the tailings water before release. 

To date, high resolution mass spectrometry is the only accepted method for measuring naphthenic acid in oil sands tailings water. The problem is, it's very expensive, it's slow, and requires highly educated and sophisticated people to perform this. It's not designed for scale. 

There has not been any testing methods that allow high frequency or mass testing of naphthenic acid in Oil Sands tailings water. It is also very complex to actually be able to measure naphthenic acid specifically in Oil Sands tailings water because of the complex chemicals in the water and sediment. 

Due to the massive scale of the oil sands tailings environment, which consists of 1.4 trillion litres of tailings, it is difficult to come up with any kind of water treatment strategies to clean the water so it would be safe for release. 

Other concerns of oil sands tailings include the Alberta government's desire to double oil production capacity, which would lead to further tailings restrictions and containment issues. 

Engineered wetlands appear to be the leader in regards to water treatment of oil sands tailings water. This is due to the cost to set up and the passive and semi-passive aspect of the engineered wetland that will help remediate the water effectively. It is also effective at working with other technologies for water treatment. There is a lot of encouraging data coming out of the Imperial Oil Curl Wetland Treatment Facility, and it's coming to light on the effectiveness of engineered wetlands. 

As regulatory targets for water come to light from the Alberta government and the regulatory bodies, the oil sands operators will have to start to move from a containment mode of the tailings to a preparation to release method, which would require implementing things like in an engineered or constructed wetland. The oil sands operators have very limited information on what's the best way to do this. This is why the Curl wetland has given such rich data for oil sands operators to look at. 

 As engineered wetlands are relatively new  to oil sands operators , it would be important to get some systems in place to be able to monitor and track the performance of the water treatment system that the wetlands provide. This would allow them to have better insights, data-driven insights, to help them optimize the performance of the wetland and ensure efficient and effective treatment of the water.  this system that will continue to learn and improve will help ensure that future seasons of water treatment and tailings remediation will help make better decisions on an ongoing basis, a learning system as you may call it.

 having visibility from a high-frequency monitoring system that can monitor naphthenic acid in an engineered wetland is helpful because it can give operational insights to the performance of a water treatment programme. Additionally, having a relational context engine will allow you to compile multiple variables to help make operational decisions that are going to deliver better efficiencies, performance, and cost effectiveness of the engineered wetland programme 

Tailings-related costs are largely deferred, uncertain in timing, and sensitive to assumptions about future remediation methods, monitoring duration, and closure performance. As a result, tailings liabilities are not meaningfully captured in current operating costs, near-term capital expenditures, or standard industry cost curves. Instead, the economic consequences of tailings management are primarily reflected in long-dated environmental liabilities recognized on corporate balance sheets. These liabilities represent the discounted present value of future obligations that operators are legally required to satisfy, even though the precise technical pathway to closure has not yet been finalized.

Understanding this distinction is critical for evaluating the potential economic relevance of new tailings-related technologies. Because current operations do not involve discharge and because future closure requirements remain uncertain, the value of such technologies cannot be assessed by reference to existing treatment costs or testing practices. Any meaningful financial evaluation must therefore focus on how improved information, monitoring, or risk management could alter the duration, uncertainty, or cost structure of obligations that already exist under current law.

Balance-Sheet Recognition of Tailings Related Liabilities
Although oil sands tailings water is not currently subject to discharge requirements, the long-term obligations associated with tailings management are already recognized and quantified by operators under existing accounting and regulatory frameworks. This section examines how major oil sands producers translate legally enforceable closure, reclamation, and post-closure monitoring obligations into financial liabilities on their balance sheets.

Legal and Accounting Basis for Recognition of Tailings-Related Liabilities
Under applicable accounting standards, oil sands operators are required to recognize environmental and closure-related liabilities once a present legal obligation exists, future cash outflows are probable, and the associated costs can be reasonably estimated.[[1]](#_ftn1) Importantly, the requirement to recognize such liabilities does not depend on the existence of a finalized technical pathway for closure or a current regulatory requirement to discharge tailings water. Rather, recognition is triggered by the existence of legally enforceable obligations arising from enacted laws, regulatory approvals, and binding conditions associated with resource development.

Measurement of Environmental Liabilities: Discounting, Timing, and Assumptions
In the context of oil sands mining, these obligations arise from project-specific approvals and environmental legislation administered by the Alberta Energy Regulator, which impose requirements to decommission mining infrastructure, manage tailings risks over the long term, and restore disturbed land to an equivalent land capability. Operators remain legally responsible for tailings facilities until reclamation certification is achieved, with no automatic release from liability based on the passage of time or indefinite containment. These obligations therefore constitute a present legal obligation under accounting standards, even though the precise timing and technical methods of closure remain uncertain.

The economic relevance of tailings-related technologies does not arise from the existence of the obligation itself, but from the assumptions used to estimate its magnitude, timing, and present value.

Across major Canadian oil sands operators, asset retirement and decommissioning liabilities are measured using discounted cash flow methodologies that rely heavily on long-dated assumptions regarding closure timing, remediation methods, monitoring duration, inflation, and discount rates. These assumptions materially influence the reported liability values and create an analytical entry point for evaluating how improved information, monitoring, or risk management could alter those estimates. Importantly, these assumption based mechanisms create sign

Economic Interpretation of Long-Dated Tailings Liabilities
This section explains why small operational or informational improvements—such as those potentially enabled by Luminous’s biosensor technology—can have immediate and outsized financial relevance, even though the underlying obligations extend decades into the future.

Tailings-related liabilities are valued using discounted cash flow methodologies that rely on a small set of core assumptions:

- Discount rate (typically a credit-adjusted risk-free rate)
- Expected duration of closure and post-closure obligations (often 50–60+ years)
- Timing and profile of future cash outflows
- Degree of uncertainty embedded in monitoring, remediation, and closure assumptions

Because these liabilities are discounted over very long horizons, modest changes in any of these inputs—particularly time and uncertainty—can materially change their present value today. This creates a clear analytical pathway for evaluating the potential economic contribution of technologies that improve information quality, monitoring efficiency, or risk management, even in the absence of regulatory change or near-term discharge requirements.

The Exciting Finding from the Kearl Wetland on toxicity: The wetland treatment effectively eliminates acute toxicity to fish by **Day 42**, even though the total chemical concentration remains high (~50 mg/L). This happens because the system selectively degrades the specific "bad actor" compounds (lipophilic O2​ Naphthenic Acids) first, leaving behind a non-toxic soup of oxidized byproducts that standard tests still count as "pollution".

**The Opportunity:** our solution can solve this measurement gap because your biosensors are specifically tuned to detect only the toxic O2​ fraction, ignoring the safe leftovers that confuse standard lab tests. By feeding this specific biological data into our **Squarehead Foundry** context engine, we can correlate daily sensor readings with environmental variables (like rain or flow), scientifically proving that a "low signal" equals "true safety." This allows you to validate regulatory compliance weeks faster and more accurately than current methods.

We believe that for high confidence that water treatment of Oil Sands Mine water  is safe for release, there needs to be high frequency monitoring and high volume testing. this data needs to be correlated with many contributing variables like temp, water flow, water refilling, rain, sun etc. This data should be visible to the regulator, and local indigenous communities to gain confidence with the treatment process. this will make the point of release smoother and with less friction because there is historical long term data that is auditable and they can see treatment progress.
