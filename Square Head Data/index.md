# Initial Data for the square head platform

*  This is a general dump for document data in the square head platform
* The data will be oilsands project related.  This could be papers on Napthenic Acid, Weather datasets for the area around the oil sands and so on.
* Formats to include.
	* PDF's
	* CSV
	* XLSX
* We will also add different datasets that may only be accessible by API/Database query


Here are several large public water sampling datasets for the Alberta oil sands region:
