In Alberta's oil sands industry, several companies operate tailings ponds to manage wastewater resulting from bitumen extraction. Notable operators include:

- **Suncor Energy**: Manages tailings ponds at its base plant and other mining operations.
    
- **Syncrude Canada Ltd.**: Operates extensive tailings facilities, including the Mildred Lake Settling Basin.
    
- **Imperial Oil**: Oversees tailings ponds at its Kearl Oil Sands Project.
    
- **Canadian Natural Resources Limited (CNRL)**: Manages tailings ponds at its Horizon Oil Sands site.
    
- **Teck Resources**: Involved in tailings management for its oil sands operations.
    

These tailings ponds are engineered structures designed to contain process-affected water and solids, preventing environmental contamination. Operators are responsible for the safe management and eventual reclamation of these sites.
