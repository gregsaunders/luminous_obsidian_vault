### Digital Products and Channels Domain
The **digital products and channels** domain describes the products and services the organization provides to the market which take exclusively digital form i.e. they can be distributed as information over a communications network rather than as physical goods and services over a logistics network. Digital channels represent the access points through which consumers can consume and interact with these products and services.

- **Digital Product Component** - A **digital product** is a product or service that can be manufactured using computers and distributed as information over a communications network (e.g. the internet) rather than as physical goods over a communications network. The shift from physical manufacturing, distribution and consumption to digital continues to be disruptive to many industries, so modelling digital products and services as a separate component type helps drive important organizational conversations.
- **Digital Channel Component** - A **digital channel** is an access point through which consumers, communities and audiences can consume and interact with the organization’s products and services. These access points include devices, like computers or mobile devices, as well as virtual locations and sites either built by the organization (i.e. its own website) or third-party sites including partner sites and social media.
