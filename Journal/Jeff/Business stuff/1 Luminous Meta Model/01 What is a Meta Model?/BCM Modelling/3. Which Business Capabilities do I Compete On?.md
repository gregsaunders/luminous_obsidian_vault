**What** - Rate your business capabilities for Market Differentiation
**Who** - Enterprise Architects, Business Strategists, IT Strategists
**How** - Workshops / Ardoq Surveys

Once you’ve agreed your business capabilities you need to use them to drive decisions.

As the basis for that we’ll start with a simple truth: Not all business capabilities are equal.

When making strategy and investment decisions about business and IT operations, it’s vital to understand which business capability differentiates your offering from those of your competitors; or which business capabilities provide most value to those communities you serve.

Resources are always limited. And your business capability map should enable you to target them where they’ll make the biggest impact.

In a mature market, it might be your organization’s ability to fine-tune its pricing with more precision than your competitors that gives you that edge. In a developing market, its the ability to define innovative products.

For those whose focus is on communities, not competition, it could be your ability to direct resources to where they’ll make the most difference.

Whatever your organization’s mission, understanding which capabilities are your performance-multipliers is critical to business and IT strategy.

#### Whatever your organization’s mission, understanding which capabilities are your performance-multipliers is critical to business and IT strategy.

**How we do this is simple**: We score each capability for its ability to provide your organization with competitive- or mission-advantage using the following classification:

1. **Commodity**
	These capabilities provide little or no competitive or market advantage and can be provided or consumed as a standardized service. For example, few organizations (who are not in the travel or hospitality business) would consider creating their own bespoke travel and concierge service, preferring to consume it as a service via a SaaS application or third-party provider.
	
2. **Market-Adapted**
	Market-adapted capabilities may provide a marginal market advantage by adapting to the norms or requirements of a particular market, but this is highly optional. For example, supporting a localized partner interoperability standard or communicating in a local language or dialect may win you bonus points in a market, but is not going to lose you business if you choose not to.

3. **Market-Competitive**
	This capability is tailored to meet the upper norms or expectations of a mar- ket. For example, your organization may decide that its employee remuneration policy should put you in the upper market quartile, or that your quality-assurance processes should comply with an interna- tionally-recognized minimum standard. In neither case are you seeking to outper- form the market, but you certainly want to appear on the leaderboard.

4. **Market-Leading**
	This capability is optimized to provide a competitive advantage against com- petitors with similar capabilities. For example, your product pricing might be optimized to ensure you always appear at the top of a deals page on a third-party aggregator site, or your marketing search engine optimisation to ensure you’re always at the top of a keyword search results page. In any case the objective is to do the same thing as your competitors, only better.

5. **Market-Disruptive**
	These capabilities provide a decisive competitive advantage through being unique, innovative or unreproducible by competitors. These capabilities are likely to be driven by a unique ap- proach or intellectual property. For example, a cutting-edge manufacturing technique, and algorithm that can predict and proactively serve custom- er needs or a unique marketing and branding style that breaks through norms and conventions.

#### Once you’ve taken a first pass through, take a step back. Challenge your own assessments

Have you rated everything as commodity or market-adapted?

That should set off some warning bells:
This is basically saying there’s nothing you do better than anyone else. If you’re in a competitive environment, that’s a problem.

Have you rated everything as market- competitive or market-disruptive?

Then you're probably suffering from an excess of ambition. You risk squandering valuable resources on capabilities that won’t move the needle on business performance. Even the most innovative companies typically focus their innovation on a narrow front.

Be honest about what makes your organization stand out, even though that may mean stepping on a few toes (everybody wants to believe their function is central to the business).

But the ultimate test is: If you were to show this map to your CEO, would she or he agree?
