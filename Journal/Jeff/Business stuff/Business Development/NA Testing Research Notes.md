There is a great deal of on-site monitoring which is driven mostly by operational needs such as tailings management, leak detection, and water treatment, as well as ambient monitoring to assess the health of receiving waters in the Athabasca River and its tributaries.

Currently, Bureau Veritas (BV) Labs, the University of Saskatchewan, and lnnotech Alberta do NA testing.

BV Labs relies on the Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) method, which has significant limitations such as counting organic acids as NAs and has lower reliability in environmental contexts. These tests cost approximately $100 per sample.

Both the University of Saskatchewan and lnnoTech Alberta utilize the Orbitrap mass spectrometry method at approximately $1000 per test.

lnnoTech Alberta has demonstrated a high bias over the past few years due to calibration and extraction issues and while the results are consistent between samples, they are consistently oﬀset from the true values.

The University of Saskatchewan is known for having reasonable quality of work with several grad students; however, there are significant inconsistencies. 

Syncrude does its analysis in-house with its own FTIR.

Industry approvals under the Environmental Protection and Enhancement Act (EPEA) require testing for NAs at approximately thirty industrial wastewater release points along the Athabasca River and its tributaries. Industry approvals under the Environmental Protection and Enhancement Act (EPEA) require testing for NAs at approximately thirty industrial wastewater release points along the Athabasca River and its tributaries.

Industry EPEA approvals also require testing for NAs as part of their groundwater monitoring programs. As with industrial wastewater release reports, operators must report on this monitoring yearly. Again, these reports are not easily publicly available, so a clear account of the number of tests is not possible. 

As an example, Suncor's 2007 Voyageur South Groundwater Monitoring Program monitored 130 groundwater monitoring wells, collecting 656 samples that were analyzed for several compounds, including NAs, and Suncor’s Base Plant has approximately 175 groundwater monitoring wells that it reports on, but many more on site to inform their internal management. Expanding this monitoring to other Suncor sites and other operators suggests that the number of NA tests done for groundwater monitoring is likely in the low thousands per year.

The Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo does not currently test for NAs in its municipal water treatment processes.

Incidents often generate additional monitoring requirements. The 2023 Imperial oil seepage event resulted in Imperial Oil, the Government of Alberta, Government of Canada and Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo doing additional water and groundwater quality sampling throughout the watershed from Imperial to Fort Chipewyan. This included 12 additional surface water sites and several more groundwater sites that were sampled between March and September 2023.

The Oil Sands Monitoring Program has 167 locations that currently or historically sampled NAs, at frequencies of monthly to more sporadically. A conservative estimate of the number of NA tests done by the Oil Sands Monitoring Program is in the low thousands. This is based on the number of current surface water quality sites (114 sites, sampled ~12 times per year, though not every site was sampled consistently), enhanced water quality monitoring (12 sites, sampled monthly from 2018-2022) benthic macro invertebrate sites (~200 sites, sampled once per year), wetland sites (10 sites, starting in 2023, sampled once per year), and groundwater sites (~30 sites, sampled once per year). These numbers are approximate because a subset may fluctuate from year to year.

The Provincial Long Term Rivers Network does not include NAs as part of its testing suite.

There are no regulations for NAs in the oil sands region, but their release to groundwater or surface water is prohibited by the general prohibition on the deposition of deleterious substances under the Fisheries Act. The Fisheries Act prohibits the ‘deposit of substances that may be deleterious to fish’ in fish bearing waters. This is a very broad prohibition which includes any compound that may be considered deleterious.

Metal and diamond mines, coal mines, and pulp and paper mills all have eﬄuent release regulations that permit the release of eﬄuent if it meets a certain quality. No such regulations exist for oil sands, though here is policy work underway both provincially and federally to authorize this release (see Proposed Eﬄuent Release Regulations.) As a result, operators have had no mechanism to treat and release oil sands process water, which is accumulating on site in tailings and settling ponds.

Non-contact runoﬀ, industrial wastewater, and depressurization water can be and is released under Alberta regulations. These permits assume that there is no contact with bitumen, so there is no testing for NAs required.
