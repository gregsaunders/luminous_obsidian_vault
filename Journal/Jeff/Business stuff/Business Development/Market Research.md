## Oil Sands Gov of Canada Water report https://natural-resources.canada.ca/sites/www.nrcan.gc.ca/files/energy/pdf/oilsands-sablesbitumineux/14-0704%20Oil%20Sands%20-%20Water%20Management_e.pdf

- Oil sands surface mining uses three to four barrels of new water to produce one barrel of bitumen, while in-situ processes use an average of 0.4 barrels of fresh water1 for each barrel of production.

- Most water used in oil sands development is recycled – 80 percent2 for established mining operations and approximately 94 percent3 for in-situ recovery. However, some new water is required and comes from a variety of sources, including onsite drainage, collected precipitation (rain and melt water), underground brackish aquifers, and the local watershed such as rivers.

- Canada’s Oil Sands Innovation Alliance (COSIA) – an alliance of oil sands producers formed to improve environmental performance in the oil sands – is developing several technologies to reduce water use. COSIA also recently committed to a water performance goal – members with in-situ operations will strive to reduce the amount of freshwater they use per barrel of production by 50 percent by 2022.

- irrigation and agriculture water allocation accounts for approximately 44 percent of Alberta’s total water allocation in 2012, the oil sands industry accounts for only 8 percent.

- The provincial government ensures the quality of Athabasca River water is maintained and the health of aquatic creatures is protected by holding operators to a “zero discharge policy.” This policy requires all oil sands process water be contained on site and disallows the release of process water to the environment. Oil sands companies are also subject to federal rules prohibiting the deposit of substances that are harmful to fish in the river. Producers that fail to follow these rules are subject to various enforcement actions, including fines and prosecution.

- The governments of Canada and Alberta established a joint oil sands monitoring program in early 2012. The program takes unprecedented steps to enhance the monitoring of air, land, water and biodiversity to improve the ability to detect changes in the environment and manage cumulative impacts. The water monitoring component of the program has been designed to quantify and assess oil sands contaminants in the Athabasca River system, as well as their effects on key aquatic ecosystem components (both within the oil sands development area and in downstream receiving environments). Water monitoring improvements include monitoring more sites to increase geographic coverage, as well as increasing the frequency of sampling and the number of different substances sampled. These steps will provide an improved understanding of the longterm cumulative effects of oil sands development.

- Mining operations around the world produce tailings and tailings ponds. In the northeast part of Alberta, oil sands ore is located close to the surface and can be extracted using mining. To separate the bitumen from the oil sands ore, the ore is mixed with hot water and chemicals in a vessel. In the vessel, the bitumen (froth) floats to the top where it can be recovered. When the bitumen is extracted from ore, residual waste known as tailings is produced. Tailings contain a mixture of water, sand, clay, unrecovered bitumen, and solvent, including some organic and inorganic compounds.

- The use of tailings ponds allows large and medium sized particles, such as sand and silt, to settle out and consolidate to the bottom of the ponds so the oil sands mine water can be reused in extraction and the tailings be more easily treated. Recycled water use increased by 37 per cent between 2015 and 2022.

- At the end of 2022, the volume of fluid tailings and oil sands mine waters on oil sands mine sites was 1.392 billion m3 and 417 million m3 , respectively. All operators were below their approved new fluid tailings profiles, total volume triggers, and total volume limits in 2022 (source: State of Fluid Tailings Management for Mineable Oil Sands, 2022, Alberta Energy Regulator).

- The Tailings Management Framework (TMF) is based on the objective of minimizing fluid tailings accumulation by ensuring fluid tailings are treated and reclaimed progressively during the life of a project, and that all fluid tailings associated with a project are ready to reclaim within ten years of end of mine life.

- Oil sands mine operators use a variety of technologies to treat fluid tailings, such as composite tailings, thickened tailings, and centrifugation. The Alberta Energy Regulator (AER) sets the operational requirements for oil sands mines, including the requirement for an operator to submit a Tailings Management Plan that outlines how tailings will be managed to meet provincial policy and legislation.

- Operators can use treated tailings in constructing upland and wetland areas. This typically involves first depositing the treated tailings into a mined-out pit. Then a cap consisting of suitable materials is placed followed by soil and the area revegetated to an upland, wetland, or combination of the two

- Operators are not currently approved to convert mined-out pits where tailings have been deposited into permanent end pit lakes. There are cases where demonstrations have been conditionally approved and are underway to assess whether tailings capped with water can develop into a self-sustaining, locally common boreal forest aquatic ecosystem.

## Mining Association of Canada -  Oil Sands Treated Mine Water Release. https://mining.ca/our-focus/corporate-responsibility/oil-sands-treated-mine-water-release/

Given the finite nature of water as a resource, our industry has an important role to play in its stewardship. How mines manage their water use is a significant point of focus for the sector, especially for Canada’s oil sands operators. 

Like many other industrial processes, the oil sands mining process requires water. However, while many other types of mines in Canada, like copper, nickel, gold, iron ore, and diamond mines, are allowed to release water (effluent) to an aquatic environment provided that it meets stringent regulatory requirements, there are no such regulations for oil sands mines. Instead, these mines have had to retain most of the water used in their processes, and significant amounts of accumulated precipitation, since the mines began operating.
#### Safe and Effective Release
Safe and effective release of treated water from oil sands mines is a crucial component to enable the reclamation of these mines, including tailings facilities. Dewatering is necessary to be able to reclaim most tailings facilities at oil sands mines, but that water can only be removed if it can be treated for safe release to the environment.

### Reducing Water Storage

Without the regulatory ability to safely release treated water from oil sands mines into the aquatic environment, operators are constantly challenged to manage ever increasing volumes of water on site and achieve mine closure outcomes as specified in tailings management and reclamation plans.

The safe release of treated water into the Athabasca River will:

- Reduce water storage requirements
- Minimize further land disturbances associated with water storage
- Enable progressive reclamation and final reclamation at closure

Oil sands deposits contain saline (salty) water that is stored in tailings facilities. The longer that water is stored and recycled for use to recover bitumen, the higher the salinity becomes, making the water harder to treat for release to the environment. Being able to release treated water sooner will help resolve the treatment issues caused by increasing salinity.
### Proven Treatment Technologies

Water at oil sands mines contains a number of different constituents and would need to be treated to reduce their concentrations to levels that are safe for release to the environment. These constituents include suspended solid material (sand, silt, and clay), and a range of metals. These constituents are common to process water used in other types of mining and many other industrial activities, and there are a wide range of proven technologies already in use in Canada and globally to treat these contaminants to safe levels.

Water at oil sands mines also contains constituents that are unique to oil sands mines; these are derived from the bitumen being mined, and include organic compounds such as naphthenic acids. Oil sands operators have the demonstrated processes, including through innovative technologies developed via [Canada’s Oil Sands Innovation Alliance](https://cosia.ca/initiatives/water) and those by leading producers like [Suncor](https://www.suncor.com/en-ca/sustainability/environment/water) and [Canadian Natural,](https://www.suncor.com/en-ca/sustainability/environment/water) to treat these constituents to levels that are safe for release to the environment. There continues to be significant investment in applying, adapting and testing the effectiveness of these treatment processes, as well as new technologies, on oil sands mine water. After decades of work in this area trying different methods with constant improvement as the goal, industry is confident that water can be treated and safely released to the environment once regulations are established.

Beyond focusing on the science and technology needed to safely release treated water, the sector is also working with Indigenous partners and local communities to understand their concerns, ensure awareness of our work and engage on matters important to all.
### Government Regulations

The Canadian and Alberta governments have committed to develop a regulatory framework that will enable the safe release of treated water from oil sands mines. Once this is defined, industry operators are expected to select the best treatment options for oil sands mine water at their sites. Water to be released will be treated as needed to ensure it meets or exceeds all regulatory requirements.

The objective of the federal and provincial regulatory framework will be to ensure that water can be safely released from oil sands mines, ensuring the protection of the environment. With effective regulations in place, more detailed planning for the treatment of mine water and reclamation of oil sands mines can be progressed.
