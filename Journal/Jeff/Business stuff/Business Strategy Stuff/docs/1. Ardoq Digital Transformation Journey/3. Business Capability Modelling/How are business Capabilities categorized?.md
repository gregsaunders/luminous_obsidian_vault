# How are Business Capabilities categorized?

Business Capabilities themselves are defined for each business, as every organization is different. Each capability is unique for the business and is based on the information that it needs, uses, and processes. However, industry-specific reference model capability maps have been defined and can be used as an appropriate starting point. Examples of these include [TMForum for Telecom](https://www.tmforum.org/?msclkid=fceb647ab51511ec9b4c4569a1c4d40e), [BIAN for Banking](https://bian.org/?msclkid=46d7d54cb51611ecbf1d8432968eee8b), and multiple [Business Architecture Guild industry reference models](https://www.businessarchitectureguild.org/store/ListProducts.aspx?catid=677483&msclkid=88b2d9c8b51611eca2aa47e8d3e70482).

Identifying, naming, and clarifying each capability not only determines the services provided by the business but also creates a common framework and structure that all parts of the company can understand.

Business Capabilities can usually be categorized in terms of Strategic, Core, and Supporting capabilities:

- **Strategic**: Capabilities that set the direction for the organization, understanding environmental and market opportunities and challenges, defining the direction of travel and objectives, planning changes to operating models and IT provision, funding and prioritizing change initiatives, and tracking them to completion.

- **Core**: Capabilities that define the organization's proposition to the market, defining its products and services, promoting them to the market and potential customers, setting up partnership and supply channels required to establish a business ecosystem within which to operate, provisioning, and servicing those products and services, and maintaining the ongoing relationship with clients and customers.

- **Supporting**: Capabilities required to support the ongoing operation or trading of the organization, through the management of finances, the provision of resources, the operation of Information Technology, and the ongoing control and governance of relations between the organization and the social environment it operates within, as well as the management of risk and provisions to ensure its continuing operation.

Supporting capabilities, although critical to the organization's operations, are not generally perceived as being core to its core generation of value, and are likely to be classified primarily as cost centers rather than profit centers.

Because organizations can be large and complex, capability models can also be large and complex. The normal way of dealing with this is to build the models as hierarchies, with the top level being broad-brush generalized descriptions of major functions or activities, and the lower levels describing those activities in progressively more detail.

A high-level capability might be Finance, which consists of a number of sub-capabilities that describe in more detail the activities that make up the Finance Capability. For example, Payroll, Tax Management, or General Accounting; and each of those will, in turn, have sub-capabilities. For example, General Accounting will have sub-capabilities such as Project Accounting, Investment Accounting and Reporting, and Accounts Consolidation.

Using a hierarchical model allows for structured capability definitions that show relationships and dependencies with typically three or four levels offering sufficient detail.

A set of identified and defined Business Capabilities is referred to as a Capability model.

An Architecture function is typically the driver for the creation of the Capability model. They will use their experience, processes, reference capability models, and engagement with relevant business personnel, to build the capabilities and overall model. Once defined, EAs will remain as stewards of the model, ensuring that it is maintained and updated on an ongoing basis.
