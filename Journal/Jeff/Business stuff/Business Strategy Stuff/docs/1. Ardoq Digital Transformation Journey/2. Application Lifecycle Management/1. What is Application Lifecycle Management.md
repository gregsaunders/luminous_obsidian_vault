# What is Application Lifecycle Management?

Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) is the supervision of an application from its initial planning until its retirement.

Oftentimes ALM is confused with the software development lifecycle (SDLC). They both deal with the development process of an application, but SDLC is limited to the development phases, such as design, coding, testing. Application Lifecycle Management, however, has a broader scope that includes the conceptualization, development or acquisition of an application, plus the monitoring of it until it is phased out.
