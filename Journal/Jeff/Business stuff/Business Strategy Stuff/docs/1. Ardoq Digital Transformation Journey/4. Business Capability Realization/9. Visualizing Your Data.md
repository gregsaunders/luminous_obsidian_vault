# Visualizing Your Data

There are some key views that we recommend for visualizing capabilities and applications tied back to your objectives and your problems statements. Nonetheless, we encourage you to look through all the views to find the ones that help tell your story. This exercise will also help you identify gaps in the data set.

### Dependency Map View
It allows you to easily see relationships or hierarchy in a compact nested visual.Great for showing the hierarchy (L0-L4) of a business capability model.

### Capability Map View
It allows you to easily see relationships or hierarchy in a compact nested visual.Great for showing capabilities and how they are realized. The Capability Map view offers a little bit more control on layout than the dependency map.
