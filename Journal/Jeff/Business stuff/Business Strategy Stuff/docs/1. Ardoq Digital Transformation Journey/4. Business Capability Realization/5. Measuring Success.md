# Measuring Success
A very important part of change is measuring the outcome. Now that we have defined the problem and what we want to achieve, take some time to think about how you would like to measure the outcome. There are 3 key areas that we should consider when identifying metrics in Ardoq:

- **Data Quality & Completeness** - More accurate & complete data used to inform decisions
- **Business Value** - Measure realization of market and operational performance objectives
- **Productivity** - Improvements seen by EA operating more efficiently.

In the **Metrics Workspace** of the Use Case bundles you can find some sample metrics to help you get started. But as every implementation of Ardoq is unique it will be up to you to identify which metrics are relevant for you to track.Metrics don’t have to be perfect or comprehensive and most importantly it’s more valuable to start and refine over time.
