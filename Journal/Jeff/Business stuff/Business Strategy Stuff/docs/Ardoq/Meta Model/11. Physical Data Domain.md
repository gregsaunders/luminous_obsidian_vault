## Physical Data Domain
The physical data domain describes information stored in a format that enables it to be easily processed by a machine.
    - Component types in this domain are commonly persistent stores of structured or semi-structured data (i.e. information whose semantics and values are separated) although increasingly machines are able to process unstructured content as well.
    - The main component type in this layer is the data store.
## Data Store Component
A data store component is one or more linked tables, files or any other type of structured, persistent dataset without a native user interface or executable business logic and configured for the storage and querying or searching of structured or semi-structured data.
    - Although a data store may exist as a sub-component of an application here it refers to a free-standing data store such as a data warehouse or operational data store (ODS).
