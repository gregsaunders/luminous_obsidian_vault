## Innovation and Change Domain
The innovation and change domain groups any type of proposed or scheduled change to the organization’s propositions or operations.
    - It describes the whole lifecycle of a change from conception to implementation, and change at different levels of granularity, from low-level Agile concepts like stories to high-level programmes.
    - Change activities are one-time and nonrepeating, their purpose being to move some part of the organization to a ‘new normal’.
    - Where those activities become repeating or operational they are modelled as tasks or business processes.
## Idea Component
An idea is a concept or suggestion for a change to the organization’s propositions or operations.
    - It may not be fully conceived, its benefits uncertain and its implementation not resourced or scheduled.
    - But the need for constant innovation to maintain competitive advantage or optimize delivery of products and services makes innovation and the nurturing and realization of ideas a core organizational capability.
## Initiative Component
An Initiative Component is a prioritized and resourced non-repeating activity with the objective of realizing a defined objective or benefit.
    - Initiatives implement changes to other metamodel component types that constitute the organization’s propositions or operations.
    - They may be decomposed into sub-initiatives (for example, Epics or Stories) and may themselves be composed into higher-level initiatives.
