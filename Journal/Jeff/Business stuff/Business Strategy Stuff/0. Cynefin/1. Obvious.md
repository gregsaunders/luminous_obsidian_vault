# Obvious Contexts – "The Domain of Best Practice"

In "obvious" contexts, your options are clear and cause-and-effect relationships are apparent to everyone involved.

Here, there are often explicit steps in place that dictate the next stage of the process. For example, problems encountered at help desks or call centers are often predictable, and there are processes in place to handle most of them.

Snowden argues that you need to "Sense – Categorize – Respond" to obvious decisions. Put simply, you should assess the situation, categorize its type, and then base your response on best practice. There is often one established "correct" answer, based on an existing process or procedure.

**However, there is a danger that obvious contexts may be oversimplified. This often happens when leaders, or an entire organization, experience success and then become complacent.** To avoid this, make sure that there are clear communication channels in place, so that team members can report any situations that don't fit with any established category.

**Another challenge is that leaders may not be receptive to new ideas because of past experiences and success.** For example, some people might automatically assume that previous solutions will work again. To overcome this, stay open to new ideas and be willing to pursue innovative suggestions.
