## A method framework for BPMN

In our consulting projects and workshops, we have introduced a great many people from all kinds of enterprises to BPMN. From that collected experience, we have developed a practical framework for applying BPMN.

This framework helps us decide which BPMN symbols and constructs to use in which situations - and also when to hold back in the interest of simplicity. The framework focuses on projects with processes that need improved technological support and in which it is the target state that needs to be modeled. In principle, what we show as modeling patterns can also be applied to other scenarios such as the discovery, documentation, and analysis of current-state processes.

For this edition of the book, we revamped the way we visualize the framework. The following section introduces the new visualization, and then we explain why we changed it. Basically, we now find fault with a widespread approach to process-focused IT projects, and we want to present an alternative that our experience suggests is better.

The *Camunda BPMN framework* in figure 1.8, or Camunda house for short, distinguishes between strategic and operational process models:

- **Strategic process model:** The primary target group for strategic process models are process owners and process managers. A secondary group early in the project may include process participants and process analysts. We provide the strategic model as a general, results-oriented representation of the process because we want to create the quickest possible understanding for an audience that has no special BPMN knowledge. We sketch the process in a few steps, but we don’t show errors or variations. See chapter 3 for more detailed information on creating strategic process models.
- **Operational process model:** At this level, we investigate operational details of the actual process. It may contain human or technical process flows, and we model them accordingly. A human flow is handled by a participant while a technical flow is handled by software - preferably a workflow engine. Of course, the human and technical flows can interact. A human may trigger a technical flow in the course of doing his or her work, as in the case of calling a software function. Equally, a technical flow may require a participant to send an email, assign a task, and so on. The human flow thus is triggered by the technical flow. We handle developing human and technical process flows in chapter 4 and chapter 6.

The Camunda house is a purely methodological framework. In other words, it works independently of particular software tools, although certain tool functions may make it easier to apply. We deal with this in section 7.4.2 on page 204.

About half of this book is a detailed description of this framework. Because those chapters offer so much practical information, we encourage you to read them even if you are unconvinced of our framework’s utility. If that’s the case, just think of our framework as a classification system for our advice on applying BPMN practically.

Either way, we look forward to your comments and feedback, not just on this book, but also on the framework itself. By nature it’s not a perfect approach, and it is subject to constant change and development. With your help, perhaps we can make it better for everyone!

#### The great misunderstanding

This is a confession. We declare ourselves guilty of spreading a deceptive image. The Camunda BPMN framework shown in figure 1.9 on the following page was used in a previous edition of this book. Released in German in 2009 and in English in 2012, it was a huge success. Hundreds of BPMN projects used the pyramid depiction of the framework for orientation. A large, international software vendor even included the pyramid in its marketing material. Unfortunately, it resulted in some misunderstandings.

In the pyramid, we distinguished between strategic, operational, and technical levels. It seems similar at first to the Camunda house, but the Camunda house defines the technical level as a component called technical process flows within the operational process model, and not as a level of its own. The pyramid put the operational level in a position equivalent to what we now call human process flows.

This change was necessary because people too often assumed that the technical level was a refinement of the operational level, in other words, that the technical level merely added more detail. In reality, operational-level models (in the sense of the earlier framework) are often more detailed than their corresponding technical-level models. For example, think of a simple technical process flow —that triggers a complex manual task - which then requires a complex manual process.

**Two related misunderstandings came up.**

The first was a perception that the modeling on three levels had to take place in a fixed sequence, that the target-state process must be created first on the strategic level, and then on the operational level, and finally on the technical level. There’s no need for that. It often makes more sense to create the operational or technical model first. Doing it this way allows you to develop a clearer understanding of the way process participants will have to do their work before you attempt to summarize or abstract it into a strategic process model. It is, in fact, common practice to conceive the technical and human flows of a process model concurrently, for example, in a workshop.

The second misunderstanding related to a strict separation of responsibilities. It was assumed that only the business side would define the strategic and operational levels while only the IT Department would define the technical level. We found this assumption most frequently in enterprises with difficult political situations, where cooperation between IT, operations, and business departments was less than ideal.

We should all understand that even a technical flow represents a business model. After all, it describes business requirements. It differs from a classic request document only in that the technical flow anticipates the executable source code - a major advantage of BPMN. The risk in such a strict segregation of responsibilities is that the technical model, while compliant with requirements, may become incomprehensible and unsatisfactory to the business.

It is a similarly serious matter not to involve IT sufficiently in the design of human processes. To believe that you can define a process purely from an operational perspective and only then align the technical implementation with it is . . . naive. Experience shows us repeatedly that operational decisions can and should be influenced by technological realities, either because what the business wants is technologically impossible (or perhaps infeasible for cost reasons), or because the technology can offer solutions that are not on the radar for the people defining operational requirements.

To summarize, you could say that the operational process model belongs both to the business and to IT. As a shared artifact, both parties should share in its development.

What does this thinking mean in terms of our approach to projects? Basically, it aligns with that of agile project organizations: The strict separation of concept from realization is as outmoded as the classic waterfall pattern of development. Most IT projects go better with iterative development, either in sprints within Scrum or otherwise, and it doesn’t matter if the project is about process improvement or automation. The business and IT shouldn’t work in isolation.

To be abundantly clear: Project participants may need to be shaken out of their comfort zones and motivated sufficiently to work honestly with "the other side." In our engagements during the last few years, the result of our strong encouragement for cooperation always has been the same: massive amazement at how productive a project can be. When IT and the business work side-by-side to define the target-state process at the strategic and operational levels, including technical flows, the technical flows can become executable within days or even hours.

As Thorsten Schramm of LVM Versicherung (a large insurance firm) put it during one of our workshops:

*"It took only a few days to highly inspire the whole project team (consisting of people from both IT and business departments) for process modelling with BPMN, and right now the first improved processes are already emerging."*

Thorsten distills our message nicely. Sometimes, the cooperation experienced within a workshop is just as meaningful as learning the BPMN methodology. BPMN thus can operate synergistically to produce positive change within the enterprise.
