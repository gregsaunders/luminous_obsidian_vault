## The BPM standards

Our focus is on BPMN as a standard for modeling and automating processes. But there is at least one standard that relates closely to BPMN, and complement BPMN well. This is Decision Model and Notation (DMN) for managing decisions.

In this section, we provide an overview of the standards, and then we describe how they can be used in combination.

#### Workflows with BPMN

Initially, BPMN stood for Business Process Modeling Notation. The first version was developed predominantly by Stephen A. White from IBM before it was published in 2004 by Business Process Management Initiative (BPMI). From the outset, the aim was to provide a standardized graphical process notation that also could be used for process automation.

In 2005, Object Management Group (OMG) took over BPMI along with the further devel- opment of BPMN. OMG is an important institution in the world of IT. It is known especially for its Unified Modeling Language (UML), a modeling standard for software design. The merger of BPMI with OMG was also the beginning of a global triumph for BPMN, as it provided incentive for many companies to switch.

In February 2011, OMG released the current version, BPMN version 2.0. We were able to play a part in that. Version 2.0 came with a new definition of BPMN: Business Process Model and Notation, because not only did version 2.0 define the notation but also the so-called formal metamodel. Then in September 2013, BPMN was published as an ISO standard by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) under ISO/IEC 19510:2013. Since then, the notation has been deliberately kept stable, because a proliferation of versions would destroy many of the advantages, because then, for example, each tool would support a different version, or books would have to take account of many version differences.

By now you may be wondering what this mysterious BPMN is in a material sense. BPMN is a specification. It exists in the form of a PDF document that you can download free from the OMG [Obj09] website. Whereas the specification document for BPMN version 1.2 was about 320 pages, version 2.0 has expanded to 500 pages. The documents define all the BPMN symbols, their meanings, and the rules on combining them.

With version 1.2, BPMN had not yet defined all the technical attributes necessary for direct execution of BPMN models in workflow engines. This led to several unfortunate attempts to convert ("map") BPMN models to BPEL models (see section 6.2.3 on page 172). BPMN version 2.0, however, made direct execution possible. That’s an important factor in terms of the use of BPMN models. Another important factor is standardization, which offers the following advantages:

- You become more independent from certain BPM tools when you do not have to learn a new notation every time you change tools. Today more than 100 BPMN tools exist; many of them are free.
    
- There’s a good chance that your partners in other companies (customers, suppliers, con- sultants, and so on) are familiar with BPMN and can therefore understand your process models quickly.
    
- When hiring new staff, it’s likelier that more of them already can read or generate your BPMN process models.
    
- When universities and private companies invest time and money to develop additional solutions based on BPMN, this is to your benefit as well. Our BPMN framework, which we present later, is an example of this commitment —we never would have developed it if BPMN were not a standard.

#### DMN for rule-based decisions

DMN is short for Decision Model and Notation. Like BPMN, it is administered by OMG. DMN is the newest of the three standards. Version 1.0 was released in September 2015. Version 1.2 is the current version when releasing this edition of the book.

A decision in the DMN sense means deriving a result (output) from given facts (input) on the basis of defined logic (decision logic).

Unlike BPMN, DMN is not about activities or processes. DMN works in an operationally similar fashion: decisions can be modeled by a business user and then executed by a decision engine. Another similarity to BPMN is that the DMN standard specification contains both a written description of the notation and an XML-based formal metamodel.

The DMN standard offers different ways to model decisions. The most popular way is the decision table described in section 5.2.1 on page 151. Within decision tables you must define the specific conditions needed to determine a result. The definition has to be understandable and implementable on a technical level BPMN users will recognize how this corresponds to BPMN and it is why we use a formal language called Friendly Enough Expression Language (FEEL). FEEL is part of the DMN standard, and we introduce it in section 5.2.4 on page 159.

Often, complex decisions are made up of comparatively simple decisions. The Decision Requirements Diagrams (DRDs) described in section 5.2.5 on page 162 help us to dissect complex decisions into their components and make them clearer.

Similar to BPMN, the value of DMN peaks when modeled decisions are executed by a compatible decision engine. This offers the following advantages:

- **Transparency:** Everyone can easily understand how decisions are being made. This knowledge is no longer buried either in the heads of certain employees nor in barely intelligible application source code.
- **Traceability:** Every decision can be logged automatically by the decision engine. It is possible to trace why certain decisions were made.
- **Flexibility:** The decision logic can be adapted more readily. It does not have to be rolled out accompanied by lengthy training or documentation; it can just be deployed. In this regard, DMN is slightly superior to BPMN because changing BPMN diagrams intended for execution by a process engine can be too risky for a non-programmer. (This may be hard to appreciate —after all, how hard can it be to add, move, or delete a few symbols? True, but the technical process is only one part of an entire application architecture that can be affected by the unintended consequences of small changes.) Something similar can happen with a DMN decision table, but the consequences are more easily recognizable and, unlike in BPMN, there are no technical attributes behind the symbols that have to be maintained. It is thus more easily possible for the business department to design or adapt software solutions independently of IT.

Activities and decisions are closely entwined in business processes. BPMN version 2.0 defined a business rule task more than four years before the first version of DMN. Even then it was assumed that when completing processes, rules would be assessed constantly as part of making decisions. The term decision management was not common at that time, however; we spoke instead of business rule management, which explains the description of that task type in BPMN.

#### Structured vs. unstructured workflows

BPMN focuses on business processes, but there is an important limitation: There are some processes that are poorly suited to modeling or automation in BPMN. These are the unstructured processes - processes that do not always take place in a predictable and repeatable way. An example of an unstructured process is that of a doctor coming upon the scene of an accident with injuries. She is unlikely to work through a BPMN diagram but instead will quickly plunge in, making decisions based on her knowledge and experience, of course, but also in reaction to the chaos of the scene. We could draw other examples from practically every sector or industry, though many are less obvious.

This is why the Case Management Model and Notation (CMMN) standard was invented alongside BPMN. OMG published CMMN version 1.0 in March 2014 and the current version when writing this edition is 1.1. We introduced that notation in some detail in the 3rd edition of this book, used it a lot when working with customers and also added support for it in our software platform. We gave CMMN two years to take off, but, within that time, we experienced limited value from CMMN in our projects, especially if you compare it to BPMN or DMN. One observation was, for example, that most logic in CMMN models was hidden in complex rule-sets if certain activities are possible, impossible, mandatory or unnecessary. These rules were often expressed elsewhere and also not represented graphically. Exaggerating a bit, the CMMN model becomes kind of a graphical bullet point list. So we decided to remove CMMN from this book to not confuse anybody that just embarks on their BPM journey. Instead we want to emphasis how to tackle un- structured processes with BPMN in section 4.5.5 on page 142 and point out the limits of this approach.

Close your eyes (metaphorically speaking) and imagine that you are hosting a workshop to design a business process. You have a room full of people who have a stake in the process, and your mutual goal is to come up with a BPMN process model. You start with a manageable circle of participants, and you ask them what the first task should be.

The answer to your question depends, they tell you, and they proceed to pepper you with an entire list of conditions. It seems that you will have to model the evaluation of conditions first, and you’ll use a gateway with many possible paths leading out of it.

During the course of the meeting, participants also point out the frequent need to jump back within the process and to repeat a previous task. While it is easy enough to represent such jumps in BPMN, if they have to be represented for more than half of the tasks, your model quickly starts to resemble a bowl of spaghetti. There are two ways out of this mess:

1. You explain that they will have to start working in a more structured manner, with fewer exceptions, deviations, backtracks and the like. This will limit their flexibility when acting within the process, which may frustrate employees and customers alike. On the other hand, the process will become predictable, repeatable, and less dependent on the implicit knowledge of the humans controlling the process. 
2. You accept that every case may be different, and that this process can not be structured homogeneously. You need to ensure that the people working on cases have enough latitude to make use of all their knowledge and experience. BPMN might be at its limit here and you need to find another way of approaching a solution. CMMN might be an option, but proprietary products might be as well. Very often these problems boil down to individual software, groupware, Trello or IFTTT alike tools or case management solutions.

BPMN assumes a clear order, a basic sequence in which the tasks are expected to be carried out. But of course there are possibilities to define branches, backflows, and reactions to events. In our projects, these possibilities are often sufficient to properly model partly unstructured models. We will further examine this in section 4.5.5 on page 142. In the real world, an entire process seldom fits a completely structured or unstructured pattern. More commonly, there are some structured parts within a process and these can be captured in BPMN - as well as some unstructured parts for which you will need other possibilities.

So let’s get going and look at our first example, including some flexibility for human intervention.

## First example

Our scenario comes from the insurance industry. It is simplified, but it represents the kinds of real-life situations we have encountered repeatedly. Note that the models used here are more than theoretical constructs or documentation; they are executable by engines, one of which is our own product, Camunda BPM. Camunda BPM allows you both to model and execute models in BPMN as well as DMN.

If you have no experience with BPMN, or DMN, the following may seem like a forced march through notational language you don’t yet know. To help, we have added cross references to the sections of the book in which we detail the notational elements.

Let’s get started.

Suppose you want to take out car insurance. Nowadays your first stop is the Internet, where you compare offers and decide on a provider. You visit the website of your chosen insurance company - in this case, the fictitious Camundanzia Insurance. You complete an application form (see figure 1.3) with the following data:

- Your date of birth is January 1, 1980. At the time we wrote this, you were 39.
- The manufacturer of your vehicle is BMW.
- The vehicle model is an X3.  

You click to submit the form and lean back, eagerly awaiting your insurance policy.

The data from the form immediately creates an instance of a business process at Camundanzia, which has been modeled in BPMN and is technically implemented in Camunda BPM (see figure 1.4). We can tell this from looking at the start event application received. The BPMN-compatible workflow engine first mentioned in section 1.1.4 on page 5 now goes to work.

![[Pasted image 20240426100849.png]]

The process starts with the determine risks business rule task. On the model side, this task is linked to the DMN decision table risk assessment (see figure 1.5) that is now carried out by the decision engine. The decision engine evaluates the input values for applicant age, vehicle manufacturer, and car model. The workflow model transferred these values to the decision engine when the business rule task was carried out.

![[Pasted image 20240426101000.png]]

Because you said you drive a BMW X3, rule number 5 applies regardless of your age. This rule states that any driver of a high-value vehicle gets a yellow risk rating.

The decision engine feeds two output values - one for the vehicle and one for the risk rating - back to the workflow engine, which continues to execute the process. In the following step we encounter an XOR gateway (see section 2.3.1 on page 28), which decides how the process should continue based on the risk assessment.

If no risks had been recognized, the gateway would have selected the path labeled none. This would have led to the issue policy service task (see section 2.7 on page 61). The work flow engine would have called Camundanzia’s backend system through an interface, and the backend system would have generated a document. In turn, the document would have been fed back to the workflow engine. The next step would have been the send policy task, which would have forwarded the document to you.

Your risk, however, fell into the yellow category because you drive a BMW X3. The XOR gateway activates the Decide on application user task (see section 2.7 on page 61) and waits for some clerk to decide manually, because he got some task in his inbox. The workflow engine is patient, but because of the attached time event (see section 2.6.3 on page 49), after two days of waiting it will launch an escalation. It will initiate another user task called accelerate application assessment. The user task could be assigned, for instance, to the team leader of the worker who was responsible for this application assessment.

Let’s assume that the office clerk with the expert knowledge processes the application immediately. He asks himself: "Should this applicant be insured despite the high value of this vehicle?" Maybe he needs to be flexible in handling the application, so in our example he can request further documents. This leads to a call activity (see section 2.8.2 on page 69) which is linked to a separate BPMN process model.

Requesting additional documents (or other activities you model accordingly) above can be carried out or skipped, that decision is up to the office clerk. In figure 1.6, we see what the clerk’s task form looks like.

![[Pasted image 20240426101411.png]]

If the end result is to accept the application, the BPMN process continues, that is, the work flow engine reaches the XOR gateway decision and selects the path application accepted. Now the possibility described above becomes reality - the service task retrieves the insurance policy from the back-end system, and the send task sends it to the applicant by email.

Perhaps only half an hour has elapsed since you sent your application for car insurance. You spent it idly snoozing at your desk, didn’t you? But your reverie ends when a new email arrives. You are thrilled at the speed with which Camundanzia was able to issue your insurance policy.

This concludes our example. We hope it was enlightening.

As you can see, each of the BPM standards has a role to play, but they also overlap. A ques- tion we get asked is why we need decision tables if business rules can also be represented in BPMN by gateways? We answer this question in section 4.5.6 on page 144.
