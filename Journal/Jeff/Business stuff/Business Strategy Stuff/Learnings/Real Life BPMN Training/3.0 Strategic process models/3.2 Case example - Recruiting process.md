Robert, a Human Resources manager, wants to improve the recruiting process. He believes that his staff members do too many tasks by hand that could be handled more efficiently by software. Moreover, he’s tired of hearing complaints from other departments about how long it takes to fill vacancies.

Robert is convinced that most of the delays are because the managers of those other departments spend too much time vetting candidates. Also, they don’t provide enough information with their requisitions, and they are slow to respond to questions. He can’t prove his suspicions though.

Talking with us, Robert describes the recruiting process:

"When a department wants to fill a vacancy, the manager notifies me by e-mail. They fill out a form - it’s just an Excel spreadsheet - where they enter the job title, and a job description, and their requirements, and..."

We interrupt Robert. The point, we explain, is not to discuss the cells in his Excel spreadsheet. We are interested in the basic sequence. The other stuff comes later.

"Oh, okay. So they notify me of the vacancy by e-mail. I have to check to whom I forward the e-mail, and that depends on who’s available at that moment. Usually I just ask around, since we are all in one office anyway."

Again, we have to dampen Robert’s talkativeness. Patiently, we explain that the point is merely to record the most important process steps and to set aside any operational details. He seems taken aback, but he continues:

"Well, then it’s simple: We post the job and wait for appropriate applications. We check the applications, select a candidate, and fill the position. Essentially, our job is done if the selected candidate signs an employment contract, even though we have to yet record his or her information in the personnel files. Is this still too much detail?"

It is. For us, however, we can now extract the following key data about Robert’s process:

- The process is triggered by a department’s requirement to fill a vacancy.
- A job is posted, applicants apply, applications are checked, and the vacancy is filled.
- The process has reached its target when the vacancy is filled, in other words, when an employment contract is signed.

Based on the key data, we build the process model in figure 3.3 on the following page, which Robert understands right away, although we did have to explain a little about the conditional event that triggers the process. We deliberately put the end event in the department’s lane to follow the BPM principle of starting and ending processes with the customer.

As a BPMN adept, did the semantic inconsistency of the model catch your eye? If we imagine a token running through the process, we have a huge problem with the submit application task and also the check applications task. If a single application was submitted, it is impossible to check several applications. That is a contradiction in content, a semantic inconsistency.

The problem doesn’t get better by changing the task description to the plural form submit applications. That makes it look as though one applicant applied for the job repeatedly, and that’s probably nonsense too. The truth is that there is no formal, clear, syntactically correct solution for this, assuming that we want the model to remain as easy to understand as it is now.

What does Robert say about our problem? Probably nothing. For him, the connection between these tasks is obvious, and he grasps the basic sequence of the process at a glance. We have achieved what we needed from the strategic process model, so we smile and nod and keep quiet about the semantic inconsistency.

The representation has another shortcoming: You can’t tell from the diagram that examining the job applications involves the requesting department as well as Human Resources. We accept this inaccuracy at the strategic level as well, since we haven’t started the detailed analysis phase yet. If we model a task or a subprocess involving more than one process participant, we assign the activity to the lane of the party responsible for successful completion.
