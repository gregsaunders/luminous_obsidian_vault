### Purpose and benefit

You must be able to depict a process from start to end at the strategic level. Such strategic process models are necessarily rough. They are necessarily compact. The audience to bear in mind is likely to be the executive in charge of a company division. He or she may be a process manager or a process owner. The strategic process model also serves process participants, analysts, engineers, and external partners. Yes, these other audiences will need - and they are likely to insist upon - more detail, but they also need to have the strategic view if they are to work together toward a goal that makes sense for the organization.

To be readily comprehensible, your strategic diagrams may need to include information on computer systems or human tasks, but the diagrams must remain compact. The point at this stage is to create something that everyone can grasp, and, at a glance, know what the process does, for whom it is done, and the basic sequence of how it gets done.

Consider a strategic model when needs like these exist:
- To clarify what is and is not part of a process.
- To identify resources for a process and assign responsibilities.
- To identify key performance indicators and specify their characteristics. An example KPI may be that a process has a maximum run time of 24 hours.
- To review a process initially in the course of an improvement action.

###  Model requirements

The chief requirement of a strategic process model is that it is easy to understand - even for people with no experience in BPMN. The model must be comprehensible so that it will be accepted as a means for helping the situation. The title of Steve Krug’s book on web usability is wonderfully suggestive when it comes to strategic process models:

**Don’t Make Me Think!**

It also must be abundantly clear who the customer of the process is. Process management philosophy is that a process exists only for carrying out a defined task for a defined customer. Ensuring customer satisfaction is the purpose that defines many performance characteristics, and these characteristics are often the focus for improvement projects.

No one can grasp a process at a glance if the model extends across several pages. Our standard for a strategic model is to fit it onto a single sheet of standard-sized office paper. Orient the paper horizontally, and you automatically have something compatible with PowerPoint. It doesn’t help to squeeze in as many lines and boxes as possible. For our strategic models, we limit ourselves to 10 or fewer flow objects and not more than eight artifacts.

In the purposefully plain model we’re describing, you can’t use the whole array of BPMN symbols. (This isn’t the time for compensation events or multiple-instance tasks in any case.) Does the model lose some of its expressiveness? Sure. Does it become less precise? Not necessarily, though it does make for a less granular representation than you might otherwise prefer. Limiting yourself to ten flow objects and eight artifacts is very restrictive too, although you can choose which symbols to use and which to set aside for the sake of simplicity. You can even use custom symbols as artifacts. We’ll discuss custom symbols later in this chapter; meanwhile, section 3.3 on page 102 presents a set of symbols that we find useful for strategic diagrams.

The second compromise is a semantic one. In section 3.2 on page 101, we give an example that shows how the semantics of strategic process models cannot be fully consistent. We struggled with this at first, but what we finally came to accept was that insisting on consistent semantics in strategic process models just made the models too complicated. The complexity interfered with the understanding and acceptance we needed from our target audiences, and so the models failed. Now, we knowingly accept inconsistencies, but only at the strategic level, mind you!

We remain strict with syntax, however, and we make certain our strategic models are syntactically correct. (The available BPMN tools check syntax and so help to enforce correct syntax anyway.) As a rare exception, we admittedly diverge from the BPMN syntax, but only if the divergence is minor in nature, permitted by the tool, and offers a clear advantage in creating understanding.

### Procedure

When do we model strategic processes? We do it either after the initial process discovery, when we have a general idea of an existing process, or at the beginning of process design, when we are configuring the new or improved process (see figure 3.2).

It is significantly harder to do an initial discovery of a process than most people think. Sometimes you have documents such as standard operating procedures available, but most of the time you have to interview the process participants or the process managers. These may be one-on-one interviews or group interviews carried out as part of a workshop.

The advantages of a workshop are that you can gain several perspectives at once, and that the participants start feeling invested in the BPM project early on. That can increase acceptance. Workshops can be exhausting, however, because everyone perceives the process differently, because they all want to have their pet variations and contingencies considered, and because they already know what goes wrong. When different departments or teams participate - usually the case because of the comprehensive nature of the processes - discussion can quickly devolve into political squabbling. By then, you stand little chance of creating a differentiated process model. Imagine you’ve drawn only two rectangles when you hear the first interjections:
- "Before we can confirm the delivery date, we have to check the order details for completeness."
- "But we don’t always do that after the order was received! Sometimes we have to check the customer’s credit first."
- "But only if the contract volume exceeds 300,000!"
- "And if it is not a class A customer!"
- "Yes, right, that would have to be checked too then. Who takes care of that?"
- "The account executive."
- "In our department, his assistant does. At least, if the account executive is busy."
- "Seriously? Do they even permit that? In our department, he always gives the account executive the order so she can check it!"

And so on. Every BPM expert knows that his or her attempt to get a bird’s eye view of the process gets lost in the croaking of the frogs who, naturally, have only a frog perspective. Unless you chair the workshop with an iron fist, the disaster takes its course: Everybody either gives up in exasperation or, even worse, agrees on a process model that looks complete but isn’t, one that may even be wrong. You may as well give up too, since your process model will only gather dust in some little-used cabinet!

When you chair an initial survey workshop, use the following as a mantra: All process models are incomplete - but some of them are useful!

We credit statistician George E. P. Box for inspiring this thought. What it means is that you should never attempt to model a process in a greenfield approach, to try to account for every contingency and any possible variation. It simply will not work out. Instead, you should communicate at the beginning of the workshop that you want to start with just a general idea of the process. Set the following goals for this first iteration:
- We want to record the process from start to end.
- We want to record the process in a maximum of eight steps.
- We want to record the standard procedure only.
- We want to record the regular responsibilities.
- We want to record neither the weak points nor to devise improvements.

If you set these goals at the beginning of the workshop, you and your frogs can achieve the first-iteration bird’s eye view you need, and you can do it in a span of 30 to 45 minutes! You must be careful to stay on target, however. Whenever a frog tries to escape back to the swamp, you have to stop him!

This first iteration is important psychologically. When it’s done, the group will feel a flush of success, and they will see that the process can be managed after all. From this basis, you can launch into the gritty details of the process in subsequent iterations.
   
Can we start using BPMN in the first iteration? It isn’t necessary, but yes, we can, and doing so has a benefit: It gives the group a good initial feel for the symbols and practices. You can also use index cards. For some time now, we have been experimenting with BPMN symbols attached to a white board with magnets. You can move them around easily during the discussion.
