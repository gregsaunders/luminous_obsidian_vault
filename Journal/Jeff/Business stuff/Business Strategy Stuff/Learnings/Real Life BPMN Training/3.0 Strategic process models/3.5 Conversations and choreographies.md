The possibilities provided by BPMN for modeling conversations and choreographies haven’t yet established themselves in real-world situations. We don’t find them in our customers’ projects, and we only use them on rare occasions. If you’re interested, the next section provides some thoughts about using them in the described use case.

Looking at the recruiting process as a conversation (figure 3.16 on the facing page), two possibilities present themselves: In the simplest case, just represent that there are three participants in the process and that they are conversing with each other. The other possibility is to add a multiple symbol to the applicant to show that, while only one hiring department and the Human Resources Department participate in the conversation, more than one applicant may participate. Certainly it helps to indicate the different cardinalities, but the success of doing so depends on users who understand the symbols. Apart from that, the conversation diagram is good for representing all the parties in a single view.

We can refine this conversation and fully model its sub-conversations. The plus sign in the hexagon of the top-level representation indicates a refinement similar to the symbol for a subprocess in our process diagrams. We can see in the refined representation that not all the participants participate in all sub-conversations. The applicants, for example, do not participate in the vacancy notifications; the hiring department doesn’t participate in posting the job.

There’s a semantic problem with this representation: The job posting is not a message received directly by the applicant; it is modeled by means of the conversational relationship. We tend to allow the semantic flaw in the interests of clearness and comprehensibility, just as in our process diagrams. One advantage a conversation diagram has over the sequential representation in a process diagram is that we can take the different communications relationships between participants into account without having to accept a complicated representation with multiple pools and their related message flows.

The representation as a choreography in figure 3.17 on the next page is even more precise because it also considers the order of communication. We can see the different messages. It is a mixture of conversation and process diagrams because we still see the various participants in the choreography of tasks and subprocesses. One advantage in this is the more differentiated examination of cardinalities: The job advertisement takes place once, and it is a message from the Human Resources Department to a number of applicants. (No, the semantics are not really correct, but we accept this for simplicity’s sake.)

In the next, application submission step, multiple applicants send their applications to the Human Resources Department. It is correct to represent application submission without a multiple instance, because this subprocess is executed only once by each applicant. The application check, conversely, is executed as often as applications are received, in other words, multiple times. It is completed separately for each applicant, however, which has its effect on the applicant communication partner. Each applicant gets a separate invitation and a separate interview, so the applicant gets no multiple instance symbol in this subprocess. The last subprocess, vacancy filling, takes place only once, and the chosen applicant signs a contract.

The advantage of the choreography diagram is that it compactly represents the communications relationship between process participants. It is ideal for providing overviews of communication-intensive processes. The question is if choreography diagrams can be understood and accepted by target groups at the strategic level. In our experience, it is hard enough to introduce the regular symbols of BPMN to such groups.
