## Understanding BPMN

*What does a monkey know about the taste of ginger?*

This Indian proverb expresses the truism that you can’t fully appreciate what you don’t understand. We see a corollary in the English expression, "Don’t cast pearls before swine."

BPMN is a pearl not everyone can appreciate because not everyone understands it. If you are new to the standard, you won’t regret spending some time to familiarize yourself with its underlying principles. For those who already know the BPMN specification, this chapter provides explanation and tips beyond the specification itself. It also describes the visual conventions we use when applying symbols. This is our modeling etiquette.

A full understanding makes BPMN an extremely powerful tool for any modern BPM project. In our experience, however, even those with high confidence in their BPMN knowledge still may fail to understand certain fundamental principles, and they often express surprise that sequence flows must not be drawn across pool boundaries.

### Things BPMN does not do  

BPMN was developed to model processes: logical, chronological sequences of events. That’s all. Nonetheless, you often hear BPMN criticized for not representing:

- Process landscapes
- Organizational structures
- Data
- Strategies
- Business rules
- IT landscapes

We appreciate how important it is to incorporate these topics into process documentation. We also know that many process professionals come from the systematic world of Architecture of Integrated Information Systems (ARIS) (see section 2.12.1 on page 89). They have worked with event-driven process chains (EPCs), and they may regard BPMN as insufficient. But feasible (and even partly standardized) notations exist for the topics in the list above, and we are glad for it! It relieves BPMN of over-complication and keeps BPMN from being a monstrosity that nobody would want to compile, develop, or even understand. 

We remind those professionals that:

- BPMN process models are easy to combine with other types of diagrams. It is just a question of the tools used.
- BPMN provides extension options, including custom symbols. We explain this in section 2.11.2 on page 88.

Obviously it would be wonderful if BPMN could provide a complete, out-of-the-box alternative for the ARIS methodology. We admit that’s not the case for the pure standard, but precisely because BPMN is a standard, software tools are now being created to use BPMN for the other necessary views.

### A map: The basic elements of BPMN

When you draw a process diagram in BPMN, you use symbols that can be assigned to the categories shown in figure 2.1. We refer to these categories as the basic elements of BPMN.

In general, certain tasks have to be carried out during a process (activities), perhaps under certain conditions (gateways), and things may happen (events). What connects these three flow objects are sequence flows, but only within a pool. If connections cross pool boundaries, the process resorts to message flows.

Furthermore, artifacts provide additional information on the process, but these cannot influence the order of flow objects directly. Every artifact can connect to every flow object through associations. (You can also incorporate your own symbols as additional artifacts into a BPMN palette all your own. We detail this option in section 2.11.2 on page 88.)

BPMN contains an additional data category. This refers to the creation, processing, and filing of information that may become relevant within the scope of process handling, thus the category’s symbols usually connect to activities through associations.

There are three more aspects necessary to a full understanding of BPMN:

- The advanced ideas and rules behind this simple scheme
- The full range of symbols and
- The practical know-how to apply this stuff
    
The ideas and rules and the full range of symbols are explained later in this chapter. The practical know-how is acquired through experience, but we offer our knowledge in the sub- sequent chapters to help speed your progress. We’ve also devised a few recipes for applying BPMN. They may help you to avoid some traps that often snare beginners.

### Perspectives in process analysis

Someone accustomed to modeling processes with other notation systems may have trouble adjusting to an extremely important aspect of BPMN: everything depends on perspective.

BPMN is based on the assumption that one or more participants can exist within one diagram. Do not, however, jump to the conclusion that a participant functions like a role, a department, or an employee! In BPMN, a participant is a logical element to which the following rules apply:

- There can be only one participant for each process. (This means logical participants; there may be many human participants.)
- The participant has complete control over the process flow.
- The participant is fully responsible for its process.
- Other participants cannot influence a participant’s process; they may not even know how it works.
- If a participant wants to interact with other participants within the context of the process, the participant must communicate with the others, and they affect their own processes accordingly.

The same process may look completely different for each participant, and how it looks depends on its perspective. This results in different process models.
    
In BPMN, the symbol for a participant and for its process is the pool; each process gets its own pool. Logically, however, a participant can control more than one process.
    
If you learn to handle pools properly, you will have mastered the most significant principle of process modeling —assuming you’re aiming for modern BPM aligned with necessary business IT. In section 2.9 on page 78, we detail this subject and also solve the riddle of why there can be only one logical participant for each process.

### Models, instances, tokens, and correlations

In the specification for BPMN 2.0, Chapter 7 contains a section titled Understanding the behavior of diagrams. It introduces the idea that the behavior of the diagrams must be understood as well as the processes they describe. (Note: Because a diagram may contain several pools, a single diagram implies n processes). This is easier in theory than in practice because some process models are so complex that it becomes hard to know how to handle some circumstances. Remember the following:

- **Process model:** The basic description of a process. A diagram may describe one or more process models.
- **Process instance:** A process carried out in reality. One single customer complaint is an instance of the complaint process, for example. Some processes may be instantiated only a few times in a year, such as end-of-quarter reporting in the accounting department. Other instances occur more often. Think of the millions of credit-report requests in a year’s time.
- **Token:** You can apply the token model, if you have a process model in mind and want to find out which process paths must or may be used during a process instance. A token is a concept we compare to a car: A car follows a road. At an intersection, its driver must decide to continue in a straight path or to turn left or right. Or perhaps the car turns and a clone of the car continues straight on. This is where the car metaphor breaks down, but we hope you get the gist: that the road system corresponds to a process model and that any particular route the car takes represents an instance. The token model can help you understand even the most complex BPMN process models, so tokens are also explained in the above-mentioned section of the BPMN specification. We apply this method frequently in examples throughout this book.
- **Correlation:** Do you ever get letters with a transaction key or a file number? When you reply, you are expected to reference the key or number to make it easier for your correspondent to allocate your communication properly. This allocation based on an unambiguous key is called correlation. Another example is when you pay a bill, and you are asked to write the invoice number on your check. If you don’t comply, your payment may not be properly allocated, and the lack of correlation can lead to reminder notices, late-payment fees, and other unpleasantness. Correlation is often crucial to the success of processes, from both organizational and technical points of view. Some of the costliest mistakes come from carelessness with the issue of appropriate correlation.

### Symbols and attributes

The BPMN specification describes the symbols provided for process modeling. It also describes the many attributes that you can assign to the symbols. Many of these attributes don’t appear in diagrams, though they are stored in the modeling tool and used when a workflow engine executes the modeled process.





## Lanes

We have talked about what to do in our processes, but we have not yet explained who is responsible for executing which tasks. In BPMN, you can answer this question with lanes.

Figure 2.24 on the facing page shows that the tasks in our sample process were assigned to particular people. We can derive the following process description from the assignments: If Christian is hungry, he chooses a certain recipe. Depending on what Christian chooses, he can either take care of it himself (cook pasta), or he can get his roommates on board. If the latter, Falko cooks steak and Robert prepares salad. In the end, Christian eats. The three lanes (Christian, Falko, Robert) are united in one pool designated flat-sharing community.

We discuss pools in detail in section 2.9 on page 78.

In the example, lanes equate to people, but this meaning is not specified by BPMN. You can designate the lanes as you like. In practice, lanes are often used to assign:

- Positions in the primary organization, for example, accounting clerk.
- Roles in the secondary organization, for example, data protection officer.
- General roles, for example, customer.
- Departments, for example, sales.
- IT applications, for example, CRM system.
