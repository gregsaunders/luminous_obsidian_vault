## Simple tasks and none events

Figure 2.2 shows a simple process triggered by someone being hungry. The result is that someone must shop for groceries and prepare a meal. After that, someone will eat the meal and have his or her hunger satisfied. You will easily recognize the following symbols and their meanings in the diagram:

**Tasks** - Tasks are the heart of the process. Ultimately, something has to happen to bring about a desired outcome. In BPMN, a task technically is part of the activities category, which also includes the subprocess explained in section 2.8 on page 66.

**Events** - Events describe significant things that happen before, during, or at the end of a process. The example in Figure 2.2 uses only none events. None events can be used in a process flow to indicate a status or a milestone. We explain about more event types later.

- **Start events** show which event causes the process to start.
- **Intermediate events** stand for a status that is reached in the process and that is modeled explicitly. They are used infrequently, but intermediate events can be useful, for example, if you regard reaching a certain status as a milestone and you want to measure the time until the milestone is reached.
- **End events** mark the status reached at the end of the process path.

Even for these simple events, we have to make further distinctions:

- Start events are catching events. That means something happened independent of the process, but the process has to wait for this event, or react to it.
- Intermediate events may occur, or they may be caused or triggered by the process itself (throwing events). The none intermediate event marks a status reached by the process and is therefore a throwing event. (Again, we will explain about more event types later, including more types of intermediate events to be classified as catching events.)
- End events take place when the process can no longer react to them. As a consequence, only the process can trigger them.

**Sequence flows** - The sequence flow describes the time-logic sequence of the flow elements: tasks, events, and the gateways we describe later.

The process path taken by our token is also a sequence flow. It is born with the process instance because of the start event. Through the sequence flow and by means of the tasks and the intermediate events, it reaches the end event, where it is consumed and disappears. This also leads to the death of our process instance.
