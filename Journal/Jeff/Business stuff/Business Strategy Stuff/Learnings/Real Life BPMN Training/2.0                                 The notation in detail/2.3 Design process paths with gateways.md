## Design process paths with gateways

### Data-based exclusive gateway

Certain things can only be done under certain circumstances, so few processes always take the same course.

In our simple example (figure 2.3 ), we want to go into the details of cookery. Driven by hunger, we think about what we are going to cook today. We only know three recipes, so we choose one. We can either cook pasta or cook a steak or prepare a salad. Let’s say that these options are exclusive - we will never prepare more than one at a time. The point of decision on what to do next is called a gateway. We decide based on available data (the chosen recipe) and we follow only one of the paths, which is a databased exclusive gateway. We abbreviate exclusive gateway as XOR.

Bear in mind that a gateway is not a task! You have to determine facts and needs before reaching a gateway. We will encounter this again in Business Decision Management (see section 4.5.6 on page 144).

By the way, it is not unusual to have three end events nor for the process to result in three end states. Recognizing this possibility can help you with more complex diagrams. Later, we will give more reasons for working with different end events. BPMN is not a block-oriented process notation, so you need not merge a split process path later - you can, but you don’t have to.

Certainly, it may make semantic sense to merge the three paths. The meal is eaten after it’s prepared, regardless of the recipe chosen. We can use the XOR gateway for merging also, and doing so leads the tokens from the three incoming paths into a single outgoing path. (See figure 2.5.)

![[Pasted image 20240430093317.png]]

The double application of the XOR gateway - splitting and merging or XOR split and XOR merge - may confuse beginners. You can even model an XOR gateway that merges and splits at once! (See figure 2.6.) You have to decide if you prefer to compact your diagrams this way. For our part, we usually choose not to do that, and instead draw the two XOR gateways in succession. This method prevents misinterpretation.

#### Parallel gateway

Suppose that now we want a salad on the side. If you want salad no matter what, you could model it as we have done in figure 2.7 on the facing page.

Here, we’ve introduced another symbol, the (text) annotation. This is an artifact that you can associate with any flow object (in this case, tasks). You can enter any text; in our example, we entered the average time to carry out the associated task. The total of the task times equals the running time of the process, which was a total of 48 minutes for pasta and 43 minutes for steak. Congratulations: you’ve just analyzed your first process based on key data!

![[Pasted image 20240430093845.png]]

Still, this means waiting 23 or even 28 minutes until you can start to eat. Insufferable! You’re really hungry, but what can you do? Maybe you don’t prepare the salad first and then cook the pasta or the steak, but you work on both at the same time - in parallel. The appropriate symbol is the parallel gateway, or the AND gateway for short, as shown in figure 2.8.

![[Pasted image 20240430094157.png]]

Diagramming tasks as parallel does not make simultaneous processing compulsory. In contrast to the example shown in figure 2.7, it is also not imperative that you prepare the salad before starting other tasks. Parallel preparation does, however, reduce our total time by 10 minutes. It is classic process optimization to make tasks parallel as much as possible.

As the example shows, the process is not only parallel (it uses an AND split), but the paths also synchronize later (an AND merge). The reason is easy to understand: you can only start to eat after both main course and side dish are prepared.

How would the concept of tokens apply to an instance of this process? The token is born at the start event, it runs through the choose recipe task, and then it plunges into the AND split. One token emerges from the gateway for each path. That means two tokens in this example: The first token enters the XOR split, and its outgoing path depends on the recipe selected.

Let’s assume we want to cook pasta. The token enters the task and stays there 15 minutes. At the same time, the second token enters the second, prepare salad task, where it stays only 10 minutes. After 10 minutes, it moves on to the AND merge. The number of incoming paths determines the number of related tokens the gateway is waiting for, so here, it waits for two tokens of the same process instance.

In our scenario, the second token arrives at the AND merge after 10 minutes, while the first token stays in cook pasta for a total of 15 minutes. This means the AND merge waits until the first token arrives - an additional 5 minutes. At that point, the tokens happily merge into a single token, which continues on the outgoing path.

Does that sound too abstract or technical? It is not. The AND merge behavior is identical to your own: The salad is ready, but the pasta is not, so you wait. When the pasta finally is ready, you eat.

Why the seemingly complicated token concept then? Think of 90 million process instances created by credit agencies, for instance, every year. Surely, these aren’t executed in strict sequence. They overlap. To define and carry out such complex processes and their various parallel operations, branchings, mergings, and synchronizations correctly every day, the token approach is not only extremely helpful in conceptual design and implementation, but also necessary. We hope it is clear by now that process instances are not identical to tokens: Many tokens can run within the bounds of a single process instance.

**Check your understanding with the following questions:**

**Question:** Figure 2.9 shows the same process, but the AND merge was left out for lack of space, and the path from the prepare salad task leads directly to the XOR merge. What happens if we instantiate the process, and we decide in favour of pasta?

![[Pasted image 20240430144906.png]]

**Answer:** The token is generated and then cloned as always at the AND split. As soon as we finish preparing the salad, the token passes through the XOR merge and eat meal executes. Five minutes later, cook pasta also completes. Its token passes through the XOR merge and eat meal executes again! That’s not the behavior we wanted.

**Question:** Figure 2.10 on the facing page shows a process that consists of two tasks only. Once instantiated, how long does the process instance live?

![[Pasted image 20240430145127.png]]

**Answer**: It lives 45 days, which corresponds to the run time of the process. Even though the token generated in the AND split passes through task 1 after 30 days and then is consumed by the upper end event, the second token stays in task 2 for an additional 15 days. The process instance continues to live until the second token is consumed by the lower end event.

**Note**: As long as just one token lives within the process, the process instance lives too! The instance cannot finish until all tokens generated are consumed.

#### Data-based inclusive gateway

We want to make our process even more flexible: When we are hungry, we want to eat

- Only a salad,
- A salad and "something real," like pasta or steak, or
- Only something real.

Using the symbols you have learned so far, you could model the situation as shown in figure 2.11.

![[Pasted image 20240430145355.png]]

If you want a more compact representation, you can use the data-based inclusive gateway - the OR gateway for short. (See figure 2.12 on the following page.) Use OR gateways to describe and/or types of situations, in which processing can flow along one, many, or all outgoing paths. OR gateways can keep diagrams from becoming overly complex.

![[Pasted image 20240430145550.png]]

We can use OR gateways to combine paths too: Depending on whether we want to eat just a salad or something real, or a salad and something real, we have to wait either for one token to arrive (merge) or for both tokens (synchronize) before we can eat. Note the difference between this and figure 2.11 on the previous page, however. In the version without the OR gateway, we could have resolved not to prepare anything (neither salad nor something real), but we ate after this decision. The OR gateway excludes this absurdity. We have to decide at least in favour of a salad and/or something real, otherwise the token gets stuck in the gateway. Strictly speaking, the BPMN specification determines that a runtime error occurs in such a case, and that’s important when it comes to technical process implementation.

In practice, handling OR gateways is not as simple as these examples imply. It’s easy to understand that progress depends on waiting for another token to reach an OR merge. It can be harder to trace the synchronization rules with complex diagrams that sprawl across several pages. Just memorizing the conditions that apply at the OR split isn’t a solution.

![[Pasted image 20240430145845.png]]

Consider figure 2.13: whether the OR merge needs to synchronize or not depends on whether the OR split runs through one or more paths. Here’s the scenario: The first token reaches the OR merge after 30 days. Because answer 2 applied to the previous OR split too, another token is on its way, and it will stay in task 2 for another 15 days. This task is completed, so it becomes possible that a decision made at the XOR split results in the second token being routed through the answer 1 path, and being consumed by the end event. What happens to the first token at the synchronizing OR merge? The OR gateway must register that the second token has vanished, and it must forward the first token.

This could cause problems in three circumstances:

- You come across an OR merge in your process manual on page 10, and you have to rummage through the previous 9 pages to understand what conditions require which waiting times.
- You implement such a process in an organization that makes a person responsible for task 3 but permits that person no control over the process.
- A workflow engine runs the process and controls the synchronizing behavior. It is expensive to implement such a check, and it is bound to fail. In some cases it may be impossible.

There are a couple of reasons for using the OR gateway - with caution. 

**Question:** Can we model the process as shown in figure 2.14?

![[Pasted image 20240430150319.png]]

**Answer:** Sure, this makes the model more compact, but it changes the meaning. This process model produces the following outcomes:

- We eat only pasta.
- We eat only steak.
- We eat only salad.
- We eat pasta and salad.
- We eat steak and salad.
- We eat pasta and steak.
- We eat pasta, steak, and salad.  

And the last two outcomes aren’t what we intend!

#### Default flow and getting stuck

There’s another aspect to working with XOR and OR gateways. (To simplify matters, let’s set the salad aside for now and focus on real meals.) What happens if we want neither pasta nor steak? In the previous models, this situation meant that our token could never get beyond the XOR split for desired dish. According to the BPMN specification, that throws an exception. In other words, a runtime error occurs.

Don’t get angry because we are talking about throwing exceptions! We’ll come back to this issue and show why it doesn’t concern only IT.

The so-called default flow protects us from runtime errors. We indicate the default flow with the small slash shown in figure 2.15. The principle behind default flows is simply that all outgoing paths are examined; when none of the other paths apply, the process uses the default. Don’t mistake the default flow for the usual flow, however. The symbol does not mean that the default applies most of the time. That’s a different question.

#### Complex gateway

The complex gateway is a category apart. While it isn’t used often, there are situations that justify its use. An example: we want to order pizza. We peruse the menu of our favorite supplier, but just for a change, we also look on the Internet. Once we find something we want to try after researching both sources, we order the pizza.

How can we model that? The attempt shown in figure 2.16 on the next page results in ordering the pizza only after the research in both sources completes.

![[Pasted image 20240430150944.png]]

In figure 2.17, neither is an option: Based on the token concept, we would execute the order pizza task twice. (Remember the test question in section 2.3.2 on page 30?)

![[Pasted image 20240430151126.png]]

Nor does the OR merge in figure 2.18 solve the problem: When a token arrives at the OR merge, the process waits for corresponding tokens that may never get there. The OR merge behavior is thus the same as an AND gateway.

![[Pasted image 20240430151237.png]]

The solution is the complex gateway combined with an annotation, as shown in figure 2.19. As soon as one of the two tasks completes, the complex merge sends the token to the order pizza task. When the next token reaches the complex merge, it is consumed. It vanishes.

![[Pasted image 20240430151340.png]]

Here’s a similar situation: Assume we execute four tasks at once. There’s a fifth task to execute once three of the first four tasks complete. For example, we ask four friends what pizza place they want to order from. Once three friends have offered opinions, we decide. We can model our synchronizing behavior with a complex gateway. (See figure 2.20.)

![[Pasted image 20240430151456.png]]

In principle, a complex gateway also can be applied as a split - to summarize several different gateways in one symbol to save some space, for instance. The OR split from the process in figure 2.14 on page 35 could be replaced with a complex gateway by writing the split semantics in an annotation. That doesn’t really make sense, though, and we have never used the complex gateway as a split nor seen it used in any practical model.
