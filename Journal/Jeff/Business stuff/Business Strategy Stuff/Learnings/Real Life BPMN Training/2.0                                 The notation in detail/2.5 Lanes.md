## Lanes

We have talked about what to do in our processes, but we have not yet explained who is responsible for executing which tasks. In BPMN, you can answer this question with lanes.

Figure 2.24 on the facing page shows that the tasks in our sample process were assigned to particular people. We can derive the following process description from the assignments: If Christian is hungry, he chooses a certain recipe. Depending on what Christian chooses, he can either take care of it himself (cook pasta), or he can get his roommates on board. If the latter, Falko cooks steak and Robert prepares salad. In the end, Christian eats. The three lanes (Christian, Falko, Robert) are united in one pool designated flat-sharing community.

We discuss pools in detail in section 2.9 on page 78.

In the example, lanes equate to people, but this meaning is not specified by BPMN. You can designate the lanes as you like. In practice, lanes are often used to assign:

- Positions in the primary organization, for example, accounting clerk.
- Roles in the secondary organization, for example, data protection officer.
- General roles, for example, customer.
- Departments, for example, sales.
- IT applications, for example, CRM system.

Incidentally, lanes have a long history in the world of process modeling. They’re analogous to a swimming pool in which swimmers swim only in the lanes to which they are assigned. Swimlane representations are common to different process notations.

In BPMN, lanes can also interlace to illustrate refined responsibilities. (See figure 2.25.)

Handling lanes often is trickier than you may expect. In our little process, for example, we assume that the tasks are clearly distributed. But what if Falko and Robert want to eat too? A representation like that in figure 2.26 would be syntactically wrong. It is not permissible to have a flow object (activity, event, gateway) positioned outside a single lane.

The solution for keeping Falko and Robert happy is to duplicate the eat meal task and to assign this task to each person (figure 2.27 on the next page). This also makes sense content wise, because the task actually is completed three times. There is still the possibility of misconception, however, since it is not evident that the three men eat together. It may not matter if Falko and Robert dine with Christian, but in cases where cooperation is intended - perhaps the task is furnish expert opinion and you want a joint opinion, not a collection of individual ones - you could apply a group frame as shown in section 2.11.1 on page 87.

**Note**: In our process diagrams, we don’t separate lane captions from the lanes themselves. This complies with BPMN version 2.0, which explicitly forbids such a separation. This is a change from version 1.2, where it was permitted. You may encounter BPMN diagrams like figure 2.28, and the tool you work with may only allow lanes with separate lane headers.
