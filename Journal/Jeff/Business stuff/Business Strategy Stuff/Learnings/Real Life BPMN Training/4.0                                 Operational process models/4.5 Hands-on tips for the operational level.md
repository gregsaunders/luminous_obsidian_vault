#### 4.5.1 From the happy path to the bitter truth The First Pass Yield and BPMN

The field of organizational process management defines First Pass Yield (FPY) as the "percentage of units that meet specifications in the first process run without need of rework or repair."

You can well imagine that a major goal of process optimization involves maximizing FPY. Traditional organizational process consultants have applied various analytical methods successfully for years, but these methods are based on key figures such as error rates or processing times. Such measures have to be either estimated or manually established in organizational process management, methods that are laborious and error-prone.

Wouldn’t it be exciting to integrate the FPY concept into the world of modern BPM (and BPMN)? After all, key figures can be measured with comparative ease, precisely, and in real time by a workflow engine.

To accomplish this integration, first understand how the FPY approach works in traditional sequence notations. Look at the sequence plan process model in figure 4.18 on the facing page, which is suitable for FPY analysis, and which we compare to BPMN in section 2.12.3 on page 91).

Notice that there is a main path running from the top left straight down to the result. Anything that needs a change follows the correction path. We can assume that the main path is the path that the process manager desires; it is also referred to as the happy path. The probability that a result is not okay and needs correction is 30% in this model. Conversely, 70% of the results do not need correction - that’s the FPY. We can analyze key figures recorded with the tasks, such as processing time, by various analytical methods to assess Key Performance Indicators (KPI). In this simple example, we could state three things about the running time of the process:

The average here results from the calculation: (FPY * 0.7) + (worst case * 0.3) = 56 + 33 = 89 minutes. This is also called variational calculation, for which a non-iterative procedure is applied for simplicity. The assumption is that the result must be corrected only once, if at all, per instance.

Could we apply the FPY approach in BPMN? Generally, yes. We showed in section 2.12.4 on page 91 how to store calculated key figures and average running times in process diagrams. Our job advertisement case has two possible correction loops:

1. When the vacancy report is not sufficient for Christine’s purposes, she has to ask Falko for clarification. We assume in the process model that this is required only once.
2. When Falko does not like the job description, he asks Christine to correct it. According to the process model, this loop could repeat infinitely. We would apply a non-iterative method to assess the key figures.

We modeled the job-advertising process at the operational level from three perspectives, so we should apply the FPY methodology to three different pools for Falko, Christine, and the workflow engine. If we show the process from end to end in the workflow engine, it will be enough to examine its pool to apply the FPY approach.

The collaboration diagram (figure 4.13 on page 129) shows clearly which parts of the pro- cess are directly captured by the workflow engine’s measurements and which are not. We derive this knowledge from the process modeled in its pool:

1. The workflow engine can measure the running time of these tasks: write job descrip- tion, check job description, correct job description, and trigger advertisement; and of the advertisement publishing subprocess.
