### Technology Capabilities Domain
The technology capabilities domain describes business model-agnostic requirements for automated processing without defining how they are delivered.

Technology capabilities are split out from business capabilities to distinguish common requirements for building and running IT and communication systems from business model or process-specific requirements fulfilled by manual business processes and applications.

- **Technology Capability Component** - A technology capability is a logical set of functions to be performed by a technology, technology service, database or application. Technology capabilities broadly align to the technology categories defined by the market (e.g. by Gartner / Forrester). Technology capabilities represent lower-level function than business capabilities. They can be composed or configured to provide multiple business capabilities or even other technology capabilities but are not natively aligned to any particular one.
