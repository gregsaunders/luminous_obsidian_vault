### Infrastructure Domain 
The infrastructure domain classifies low-level software and hardware required to build, deploy and support higher-level Applications that deliver Business Capabilities.

The primary component types in this domain are technology service and server. It is important to understand that these represent actual physical deployments of this hardware and software, and not just their type, version or make/models â€“ these are defined in the technology catalog domain.

**Technology Service Component** - A technology service represents the bundling of specific software with hardware to provide a predefined deployable building-block for an IT system. When provided by a third party it may be referred to as Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) or Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS).

**Server Component** - A server is a unit of computing hardware dedicated to managing network resources. Servers may be specialized by function (for example an application server, a database server, an email server or a web server) depending on their hardware configuration or the software products deployed onto them.

Servers may also be classified as virtual or physical depending on whether virtualization software is deployed. But ultimately a physical server underlies any configuration.

**Node Component** - A node represents a grouping or cluster of infrastructure resources managed as a single or combined resource.
