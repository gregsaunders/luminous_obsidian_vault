### Logical Information Domain
The **logical information domain** provides implementation-agnostic descriptions of the types of information processed by the organization. Components in this domain describe core business concepts like customer or account in terms of their fundamental meaning, definitions and semantic relationships. By linking these descriptions to components in physical domains like databases or business artefacts the representations and locations of this information can be analyzed - for example to define master data sources or understand whether the organization complies to regulation.

- **Data Entity Component** -  An data entity is a logical grouping of data items into a set that corresponds to a real-world object or concept like a car, an account or a person. Entity models are used to define efficient data storage structures like databases or to identify master sources of business data across applications and data stores.
- **Metric** - A metric represents a quantitative unit of measurement used to track the performance of an element or domain. The metric component represents the definition of the unit of measurement, not its value. Metrics are used to classify both current measurement values - for example, actual performance measures as found in a report or dashboard - and future or target measurement values - for example, target measures in support of an objective.


### Luminous Data Entities: 
1. **Client Entity:**  
   - **Description:** Represents the organizations (e.g., oil sands operators, consulting firms) and individual customers who utilize the testing and consulting services.  
   - **Attributes:** Client name, contact information, industry classification, contract details, access roles for data portal.

2. **Sample Entity:**  
   - **Description:** Captures details of water samples submitted for testing, ensuring full traceability from collection to results.  
   - **Attributes:** Sample ID, date/time of collection, geographic coordinates, sample condition (temperature, handling notes), associated client and tailings pond identifier.

3. **Test Result Entity:**  
   - **Description:** Represents the outcome of laboratory analyses performed on each sample.  
   - **Attributes:** Test ID, NA concentration levels, microbial community profile, lab technician ID, test method used, test completion timestamp, quality assurance parameters.

4. **Remediation Recommendation Entity:**  
   - **Description:** Contains guidance and strategic actions proposed by consultants to improve remediation based on test results and analytics.  
   - **Attributes:** Recommendation ID, recommended microbial strains or treatments, estimated impact on NA reduction, timeline for implementation, associated client and sample IDs.

5. **Regulatory Standard Entity:**  
   - **Description:** Defines permitted contaminant levels and compliance thresholds set by environmental regulators.  
   - **Attributes:** Regulation reference, maximum allowed NA concentrations, reporting frequency requirements, compliance status indicators.

6. **Contract/SLA Entity:**  
   - **Description:** Stores details of service agreements, including test frequency, turnaround times, pricing models, and data usage rights.  
   - **Attributes:** Contract ID, start/end dates, agreed turnaround time (TAT), agreed remediation support services, billing terms.

7. **Analytics and Trend Data Entity:**  
   - **Description:** Houses aggregated and processed data generated by the analytics platform, focusing on historical patterns, predictions, and benchmarking.  
   - **Attributes:** Trend ID, time series data for NA concentrations, predictive model outputs, anomaly detection flags, benchmark comparisons against industry averages.

8. **User Access & Permissions Entity:**  
   - **Description:** Governs who can view, edit, and manage data, ensuring governance and data security.  
   - **Attributes:** User ID, role, permissions (e.g., read-only, admin), associated client or internal team, audit logs for data interactions.

### Luminous Metrics:  
1. **NA Concentration Metric:**  
   - **Definition:** Measures the level of naphthenic acids detected in a given sample, expressed in mg/L or similar unit.  
   - **Use Case:** Compare results against regulatory thresholds and historical averages to determine compliance and remediation needs.

2. **Turnaround Time (TAT) Metric:**  
   - **Definition:** Measures the elapsed time from sample receipt to finalized test results delivered to the client.  
   - **Use Case:** Ensures adherence to SLAs and identifies opportunities to streamline lab operations.

3. **Remediation Effectiveness Metric:**  
   - **Definition:** Quantifies the change in NA concentration levels or improvement in water quality after implementing recommended remediation strategies.  
   - **Use Case:** Demonstrates the value of consulting services and supports iterative improvements in treatment methods.

4. **Data Portal Uptime & Performance Metric:**  
   - **Definition:** Measures system availability, response times, and error rates for the data portal.  
   - **Use Case:** Ensures a reliable client experience and informs infrastructure scaling decisions.

5. **Regulatory Compliance Rate Metric:**  
   - **Definition:** Percentage of samples meeting or exceeding environmental standards within a given reporting period.  
   - **Use Case:** Helps clients track progress toward consistent compliance and highlights areas needing intervention.

By defining these logical data entities and metrics, the organization can maintain an information architecture that supports accurate testing, effective remediation strategies, regulatory compliance, and strategic client relationships. This logical framework guides the eventual technical implementation, data governance, and continuous service improvements.
