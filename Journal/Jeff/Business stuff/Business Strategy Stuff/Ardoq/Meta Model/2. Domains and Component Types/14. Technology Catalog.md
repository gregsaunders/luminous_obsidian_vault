### Technology Catalog Domain
The technology catalog domain meets the need to record and managed the use of commercial technologies or technology standards within the organization. Components in this domain represent standards or master copies which may be deployed in multiple places within the organization. Therefore the domain is not an inventory of deployed applications, technology services, servers and devices and so on, but a catalog of the technologies available to the organization. It can be used to store information such as software or standard versions and lifecycle dates (e.g. out of support date) in a single place.

**Message Format Component** - A message format is a standardized and repeatable data structure designed to transmit data from one IT system to another. It may be defined as part of an interface or API response. Common formats include XML and JSON documents.

**Technology Product Component** - A technology product is any commercially-offered item of software, hardware or firmware which can be deployed to provide one or more business capabilities or used to build an IT system by providing one or more technology capabilities.

Itâ€™s important to emphasize that the technology product component type represents the master copy or make/model of an item of technology and not its deployed instances which are modeled as applications, technology services or servers, for example. So this component type is used to build a master list of product, version and even -dot version or patch level information for any commercial item of software (from ERP systems to operating systems), or makes and models of firmware or devices.

**Language / Library Component** - A language / library is a computer language or syntax or set of predefined functions that can be used to build software systems.


### Luminous Message Format:

1. **JSON as a Standard Data Interchange Format:**  
   - **Rationale:** Widely supported, human-readable, and easily consumed by front-end applications, APIs, and analytical tools.  
   - **Use Case:** Transmitting test results, configuration settings, and analytics outputs between internal systems and client-facing portals.

2. **CSV for Bulk Data Exports:**  
   - **Rationale:** Simple, spreadsheet-friendly format ideal for clients or partners who need offline analysis or integration into legacy tools.  
   - **Use Case:** Providing clients with historical test results or large datasets for third-party analysis.

### Luminous Technology Products:

1. **Cloud Provider Services (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP):**  
   - **Examples:** EC2 for compute, S3/Blob Storage for object storage, RDS/Cloud SQL for relational databases, and managed Kubernetes services.  
   - **Rationale:** Offers scalable, pay-as-you-go infrastructure with a rich ecosystem of managed services to accelerate development.

2. **Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS):**  
   - **Examples:** Commercial LIMS solutions (like LabVantage, STARLIMS, or Benchling) or an open-source alternative.  
   - **Rationale:** Provides structured sample tracking, workflow automation, and data integration capabilities purpose-built for laboratory settings.

3. **Business Intelligence & Analytics Tools (e.g., Power BI, Looker, Tableau):**  
   - **Rationale:** Delivers interactive dashboards, self-service reporting, and rich data visualization features essential for internal teams and clients.

4. **CRM & ERP Solutions (e.g., Salesforce, HubSpot, NetSuite):**  
   - **Rationale:** Standardize client management, contract handling, and financial operations to maintain consistency as the startup scales.

5. **DevOps & CI/CD Tooling (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins, Azure DevOps):**  
   - **Rationale:** Enables consistent, automated deployment pipelines and integration testing, improving development speed and reliability.

6. **Security & Compliance Tools (e.g., CyberArk for secrets management, Splunk or Datadog for logging and SIEM):**  
   - **Rationale:** Maintains data confidentiality, integrity, and availability, ensuring the environment meets regulatory and client security expectations.

### Luminous Languages / Libraries:

1. **Python for Data Analysis & Bioinformatics:**  
   - **Rationale:** Extensive scientific and bioinformatics libraries (e.g., Biopython, Pandas, Scikit-learn) facilitate rapid analysis, modeling, and development.  
   - **Use Case:** Core analytical and microbiological data processing tasks.

2. **JavaScript/TypeScript for Front-End & API Development:**  
   - **Rationale:** Broad ecosystem support (Node.js, React, Angular), enabling creation of scalable web applications and flexible APIs.  
   - **Use Case:** Building the client portal and integration services.

3. **R for Statistical Analysis:**  
   - **Rationale:** Offers advanced statistical techniques and niche packages for environmental data analysis.  
   - **Use Case:** Complex modeling, validating lab methodologies, and supporting research-driven use cases.

4. **Containerization & Orchestration Tooling (Docker, Helm Charts):**  
   - **Rationale:** Libraries and configurations that ensure consistent, portable deployment of applications and services.  
   - **Use Case:** Streamlining environment setup, versioning, and scaling.

By cataloging these message formats, technology products, and programming languages/libraries early, the company creates a referenceable, maintainable technology stack. This baseline helps ensure compatibility, scalability, and compliance while allowing the business to quickly adapt to evolving requirements and industry standards.
