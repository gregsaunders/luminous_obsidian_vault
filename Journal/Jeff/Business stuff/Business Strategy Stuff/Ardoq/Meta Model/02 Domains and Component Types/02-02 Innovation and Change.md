### Innovation and Change Domain
The **innovation and change domain** groups any type of proposed or scheduled change to the organization’s propositions or operations. It describes the whole lifecycle of a change from conception to implementation, and change at different levels of granularity, from low-level Agile concepts like stories to high-level programmes.

Change activities are one-time and nonrepeating, their purpose being to move some part of the organization to a ‘new normal’. Where those activities become repeating or operational they are modelled as tasks or business processes.

- **Idea Component** - An **idea** is a concept or suggestion for a change to the organization’s propositions or operations. It may not be fully conceived, its benefits uncertain and its implementation not resourced or scheduled. But the need for constant innovation to maintain competitive advantage or optimize delivery of products and services makes innovation and the nurturing and realization of ideas a core organizational capability.

- **Initiative Component** - An **initiative** is a prioritized and resourced non-repeating activity with the objective of realizing a defined objective or benefit. Initiatives implement changes to other metamodel component types that constitute the organization’s propositions or operations. They may be decomposed into sub-initiatives (for example, Epics or Stories) and may themselves be composed into higher-level initiatives.


### Luminous Ideas:
1. **Broadening Contaminant Detection:**  
   - Extend the biosensor’s capabilities beyond NAs to other waterborne contaminants commonly found in tailings ponds or related industries.  
   - Enhance versatility to appeal to a wider customer base, fostering cross-industry adoption.

2. **In-Situ Remediation Microbes:**  
   - Engineer or identify microbial strains that not only detect but actively degrade NAs, transforming the biosensor into a proactive remediation tool.  
   - Use data from sensors to guide controlled introductions of beneficial microbial communities that improve water quality.

3. **Integrated Data Analytics Platform:**  
   - Develop a cloud-based analytics solution that leverages sensor data to provide predictive insights, trend analysis, and customized remediation plans.  
   - Offer subscription-based analytics services, turning raw data into actionable strategies for customers.

4. **Regulatory Collaboration and Standardization:**  
   - Engage with regulators early to co-develop standards for biosensor testing, validation, and reporting.  
   - Position the company as a thought leader influencing regulatory frameworks, ensuring that the technology becomes the industry benchmark.

### Luminous Initiatives:  
1. **Pilot Remediation Trials:**  
   - Launch a series of controlled field tests where biosensors guide targeted microbial inoculations in tailings ponds.  
   - Measure the effectiveness, cost savings, and environmental benefits to strengthen the value proposition and support regulatory approval.

2. **R&D for Enhanced Microbial Suites:**  
   - Initiate an internal research program to identify or engineer bacterial consortia optimized for specific degradation pathways.  
   - Document improvements in NA breakdown rates and integrate learnings into future product updates.

3. **Analytics Platform Development Project:**  
   - Invest in creating a secure, scalable data platform with dashboards and predictive modeling tools.  
   - Partner with data science firms or internal AI specialists to build features that help clients make informed, proactive decisions.

4. **Regulatory Engagement Initiative:**  
   - Form a dedicated team to work with environmental agencies and industry groups to develop protocols, certifications, and guidelines.  
   - Host workshops and provide educational materials to regulators and stakeholders, accelerating acceptance and trust in the technology.
