Just as component types are grouped by different domains, reference types also fall into common **categories** according to the type of relationship they represent.

There are **four** categories of reference type in the Ardoq Metamodel: Structure, behaviour, temporal and role references:

- **Structure references** represent a persistent relationship or configuration between two components.
- **Behaviour references** represent a dynamic interaction over time between two components. This may change the state, configuration or behaviour of one or both of those components.
- **Temporal references** represent a time-based relationship between two components where the lifecycle of one component has an effect or dependency on the lifecycle of another.
- **Role references** represent the specific responsibilities or behaviours a party (person or organization) has in relation to a component.
