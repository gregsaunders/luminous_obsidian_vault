The metamodel breaks down into six layers called the **5P-M** layers.

The layers are based on the principle that to offer products and services to its environment the organization performs a value transformation through processing.

**Market Layer** - Describes the external environment and actors the organization transacts and interacts with.
**Proposition Layer** - Describes the products or services the organization offers to the external environment.
**Processed Layer** - Describes the subject of processing activity. For most enterprise modeling this is information.
**Process Layer** - Describes the set of repeatable processing activities, tasks or behaviours.
**Processor Layer** - Describes the agents capable of performing processing activity i.e. work.
**Place Layer** - Describes the physical or virtual location of the processing agent.

Each of the 5P-M layers depends on the one beneath it.
