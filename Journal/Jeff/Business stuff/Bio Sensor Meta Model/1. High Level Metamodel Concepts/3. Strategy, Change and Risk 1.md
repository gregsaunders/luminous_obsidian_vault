So far weâ€™ve modeled the organization in a **steady state**.

We now need to introduce some extra concepts to enable the organization to deal with **planned and unplanned change**.

Modeling **strategy, change and innovation** enables the organization to execute intentional change by first directing and then modifying any aspect of its propositions or operations.

Modeling **risk and controls** enable the organization to anticipate and mitigate the risks of involuntary change or impacts to its propositions or operations.
