### Risk and Controls Domain
The risk and controls domain covers the modelling of risk - unintended potential changes that cause a loss to the organization - as well as the controls designed to prevent them or mitigate their effects. Because risks represent a change event, it is modeled in a similar way to change an innovation, with the ability to impact any parts of the organization’s proposition or operation.

**Risk Component** - A risk is a potential unintended change or impact that causes a loss to the organization. Risks can broadly be subdivided into strategic risks (that impact the organization’s business model) and operational risks (that impact the organization’s day-to-day running). Risks are also classified as business risks that impact business or manual operations and information security, cyber-risks or threats that impact IT systems, technologies and networks.

**Control Domain** - A control is an administrative, technical, or legal method used to manage risk. Controls are safeguards or countermeasures and include rules and legislature, practices and policies, processes, technologies and organizational structures designed to avoid or minimize the impact of adverse and unintended change.

# Luminous Risks and Controls

#### Strategic & Market Risks:
- **Risk:** Slow industry adoption due to conservative market or prolonged regulatory approvals.  
- **Risk:** Competitors introducing similar biosensor technologies or undercutting prices.  
- **Risk:** Regulatory changes that raise compliance costs or require additional testing capabilities.  

**Controls:**  
- **Control:** Continuous market and regulatory monitoring to anticipate changes and adjust strategy accordingly.  
- **Control:** Diversification of client base (expanding into mining or pulp & paper industries).  
- **Control:** Strategic partnerships with established labs or industry groups to build credibility and market presence.

#### Operational & Quality Risks:
- **Risk:** Sample handling errors leading to inaccurate test results or lost samples.  
- **Risk:** Equipment failures, contamination in the lab, or biosensor calibration issues affecting data quality.  
- **Risk:** Supply chain disruptions for biosensor components or reagents.  

**Controls:**  
- **Control:** Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and checklists for sample intake, testing, and storage.  
- **Control:** Regular equipment maintenance, calibration schedules, and backup instruments to ensure consistent operation.  
- **Control:** Multiple suppliers and inventory management practices to prevent stockouts or delays.

#### Data Integrity & Analytics Risks:
- **Risk:** Misinterpretation of analytics outputs due to faulty algorithms or incorrect data ingestion.  
- **Risk:** Data quality issues (missing, incomplete, or corrupted data) leading to invalid insights.  

**Controls:**  
- **Control:** Rigorous data validation procedures before analytics processing.  
- **Control:** Regular algorithm reviews, model versioning, and peer evaluations of data interpretation.  
- **Control:** Metadata management and audit trails to trace data origins, transformations, and usage.

#### Cybersecurity & Technology Risks:  
- **Risk:** Data breaches exposing client test results, damaging trust and incurring regulatory penalties.  
- **Risk:** Ransomware or DDoS attacks impacting the availability of client portals and operational systems.  
- **Risk:** Unauthorized internal access leading to data tampering or intellectual property theft.  
**Controls:**  
- **Control:** Role-based access controls, strong authentication, and encryption of data at rest and in transit.  
- **Control:** Regular vulnerability assessments, penetration tests, and patch management for all systems.  
- **Control:** Incident response plan, including backups and tested disaster recovery processes to ensure business continuity.

#### Financial & Reputational Risks: 
- **Risk:** Inaccurate test results leading to fines, lawsuits, or reputational damage if clients make decisions based on flawed data.  
- **Risk:** Delayed project deliverables causing loss of client confidence or revenue.  

**Controls:**  
- **Control:** Comprehensive quality assurance programs and third-party validation or certification of testing methods.  
- **Control:** Professional liability insurance and well-structured client contracts to mitigate legal exposure.  
- **Control:** Transparent communication and remediation policies to promptly address and correct any errors.

#### People & Organizational Risks: 
- **Risk:** Key personnel turnover reducing specialized capabilities (lab expertise, data analysis, regulatory knowledge).  
- **Risk:** Communication breakdowns in a distributed workforce, leading to delays or errors.  

**Controls:**  
- **Control:** Cross-training staff to ensure redundancy of critical skills.  
- **Control:** Documented knowledge bases, SOPs, and onboarding processes to quickly upskill new hires.  
- **Control:** Collaboration tools, regular virtual team meetings, and defined communication protocols to maintain alignment and visibility.

#### Health, Safety & Environmental (HSE) Risks:  
- **Risk:** Lab accidents (chemical spills, contamination) jeopardizing employee health and sample integrity.  
- **Risk:** Improper disposal of contaminated materials harming the environment.  
**Controls:**  
- **Control:** Compliance with HSE guidelines, proper storage and disposal of samples and chemicals.  
- **Control:** Regular safety training, protective gear, and emergency response plans.  
- **Control:** Environmental management systems ensuring sustainable operations and adherence to environmental best practices.

By identifying these risks early and implementing corresponding controls, the startup positions itself to maintain credibility, ensure regulatory compliance, protect client data, and foster sustainable growth. Each control, whether procedural, technical, or organizational, collectively contributes to a resilient, well-governed operational foundation.
