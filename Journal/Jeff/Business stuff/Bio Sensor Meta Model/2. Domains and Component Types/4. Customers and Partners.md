### Customers and Partners Domain
The **customers and partners** domain groups external parties – people and organizations – which the organization interacts with through providing products and services and running its operations. These people and organizations can fulfil a number of roles beyond just consuming the organization’s products and services. They include business partners, suppliers, competitors, regulators – any external party the organization has a need to track.

- **Customer Segment Component** - A **customer segment** is a grouping of customers who have similar needs, properties or behaviours. Enterprise models typically do not model individual customers, so need some method of grouping them. There are several ways to segment a customer base, including demographic and socioeconomic categorization. The flood of personal behavioural data generated by digital interactions has led to ever more sophisticated and targeted segmentations. However, organizations still find it useful to work with broad segmentation categories which enable them to identify over provisioned or underserved markets.

- **External Organization Component** - An **external organization** is any third party organization which the organization has an interest in. They can fulfil a number of roles in relation to the organization, the most commonly modeled of which are suppliers and distribution partners. However, other important roles include competitors, regulators, standards bodies, research collaborators, media and more.
