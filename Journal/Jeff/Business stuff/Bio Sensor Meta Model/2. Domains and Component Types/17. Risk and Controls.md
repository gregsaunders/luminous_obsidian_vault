### Risk and Controls Domain
The risk and controls domain covers the modelling of risk - unintended potential changes that cause a loss to the organization - as well as the controls designed to prevent them or mitigate their effects. Because risks represent a change event, it is modeled in a similar way to change an innovation, with the ability to impact any parts of the organization’s proposition or operation.

**Risk Component** - A risk is a potential unintended change or impact that causes a loss to the organization. Risks can broadly be subdivided into strategic risks (that impact the organization’s business model) and operational risks (that impact the organization’s day-to-day running). Risks are also classified as business risks that impact business or manual operations and information security, cyber-risks or threats that impact IT systems, technologies and networks.

**Control Domain** - A control is an administrative, technical, or legal method used to manage risk. Controls are safeguards or countermeasures and include rules and legislature, practices and policies, processes, technologies and organizational structures designed to avoid or minimize the impact of adverse and unintended change.
