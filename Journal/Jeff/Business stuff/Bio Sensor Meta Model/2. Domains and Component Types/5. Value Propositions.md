### Value Propositions Domain
The **value propositions** domain enables products managers and business planners to model the logical characteristics of a product or service in terms of its value to consumers without specifying which products and services will realize that value. This enables organizations to analyze a product portfolio for gaps (i.e. an unserved market) or redundancies (i.e. where two products potentially compete for the same market).

- **Value Proposition Component** - A value proposition is an abstracted description of the value the organization offers to consumers by meeting their needs, addressing their concerns or providing goods or services that are attractive to them. Value propositions should be defined in relation to market concepts like personas and customer segments and are realized by the physical or digital products and services the organization creates.
