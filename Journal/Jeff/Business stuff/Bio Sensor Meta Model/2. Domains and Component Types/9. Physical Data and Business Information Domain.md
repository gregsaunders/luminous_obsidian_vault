### Physical Data Domain
The physical data domain describes information stored in a format that enables it to be easily processed by a machine. Component types in this domain are commonly persistent stores of structured or semi-structured data (i.e. information whose semantics and values are separated) although increasingly machines are able to process unstructured content as well.

The main component type in this layer is the data store.

**Data Store Component** - A data store is one or more linked tables, files or any other type of structured, persistent dataset without a native user interface or executable business logic and configured for the storage and querying or searching of structured or semi-structured data.

Although a data store may exist as a sub-component of an application here it refers to a free-standing data store such as a data warehouse or operational data store (ODS).

### Business Information Domain
The **business information domain** classifies physical or digital information assets designed primarily to be read by people, such as documents or video. This type of information may be referred to as content or unstructured information. The main concept in this domain is the business artefact.
- **Business Artefact Component** - A **business artefact** is an item of unstructured information like a document, an image or a video or audio file. Traditionally these formats are easily read by humans who can understand their meaning but less easily by machines. However, as machine learning improves unstructured content is increasingly used an input into or output from automated processes.
