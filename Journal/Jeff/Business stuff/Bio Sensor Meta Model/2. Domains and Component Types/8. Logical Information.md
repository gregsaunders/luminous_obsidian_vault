### Logical Information Domain
The **logical information domain** provides implementation-agnostic descriptions of the types of information processed by the organization. Components in this domain describe core business concepts like customer or account in terms of their fundamental meaning, definitions and semantic relationships. By linking these descriptions to components in physical domains like databases or business artefacts the representations and locations of this information can be analyzed - for example to define master data sources or understand whether the organization complies to regulation.

- **Data Entity Component** -  An data entity is a logical grouping of data items into a set that corresponds to a real-world object or concept like a car, an account or a person. Entity models are used to define efficient data storage structures like databases or to identify master sources of business data across applications and data stores.
- **Metric** - A metric represents a quantitative unit of measurement used to track the performance of an element or domain. The metric component represents the definition of the unit of measurement, not its value. Metrics are used to classify both current measurement values - for example, actual performance measures as found in a report or dashboard - and future or target measurement values - for example, target measures in support of an objective.
