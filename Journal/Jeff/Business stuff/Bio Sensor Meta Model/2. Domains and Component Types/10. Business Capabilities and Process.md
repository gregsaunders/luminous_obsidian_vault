### Business Capabilities Domain
The business capabilities domain describes the organizationâ€™s requirements for processing or functionality. Capabilities are logical, describing what processing is required without specifying how it is realized. To understand how they are realized by people and technology business capabilities can be linked to components in the business processes and applications domains. To understand how capabilities underpin products and services, business capabilities are mapped to value streams.

- **Business Capabilities Component** - A business capability is a logical activity or group of activities performed by the organization. Unlike a business process, a business capability is defined by grouping activities that access or utilize a common resource (like customer information) rather than in response to a particular trigger or event. For most organizations, business capabilities can be thought of as the information processing requirement which may be fulfilled by a manual business process, an automated application, or both. Because of increasing automation the balance between the proportion of business capabilities implemented through manual rather than automated means will shift over time.
- **Value Stream Component** - A value stream is the sequential orchestration or execution of activities and resources required to create one or more propositions. In effect, it is a high-level process which orchestrates lower-level processes as well as applications, integrations and technology services when expressed physically; it can also be expressed logically as the orchestration of the capabilities which those processes, applications etc. realize. In either case, it results in the delivery of a consumable product or service.

### Business Processes Domain
The business process domain represents the manual (i.e. non-automated) processing activities of the organization. Business processes are composed by linking together multiple lower-level processes or tasks which can be orchestrated as part of a value stream. Automated business processes are modeled as applications.

- **Process Component** - A process is a repeatable item of work or activity performed by one or more people. Processes represent a sequence or orchestration of lower-level processes, tasks or activities.
