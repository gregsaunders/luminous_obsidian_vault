# What is the goal of the Business?

### What are the necessary conditions?

If any of these three is removed, the others can never be achieved. Our business might make hefty profits in the short-term, but no one will work there very long if we and the employees are dissatisfied. What will happen to profits then? And if the customers are unhappy, they will find alternatives. How long can profits continue to grow and employees continue to be satisfied without any customers? If we define the system goal as any of the above three necessary conditions, the remaining two are automatically required as essential input!  
  
  “Wealth, like happiness, is never attained when sought after directly, it comes as a by-product of providing a useful service.” - Henry Ford  

### What is "The Goal" then?

TOC defines every system in terms of it's Goal. Without a Goal there can be no constraint! 

Not all three conditions are equally measurable. Gauging Employee Satisfaction is not as straightforward as just taking a survey. Customers, no matter how satisfied, always crave for more. Profits are easily quantifiable in currency units and work well in comparing current to prior periods. For convenience sake, TOC frames the Goal of a publicly traded companies in terms of making more and more money. 

Not-for-profit companies, wholly owned companies, and individual people this is not as straightforward, this requires more introspection to determine our goal. For example, a not-for-profit hospital may exists to heal more and more people, etc. 

##### Examples
- **Goal (Score) -** Happiness; satisfaction of living a full life versus making more money.
- **Purpose (Game)** - Varies; Beauty, mastery, workmanship, helping others, protecting the environment etc. versus Rendering valuable services to customers 
- **Necessary Conditions (Means)** - Secure & Satisfied, healthy, self esteem, family / group versus Secure and satisfied employees, customers, suppliers, investors, lenders, etc. 


# Getting Started with ToC

Capitalize on **a crisis** to begin the transformation. This could be a working capital shortage, dismal profitability, poor customer due-date performance, high-stress high-workload environment, frequent internal conflicts, external crisis in the economy/industry, etc. If your company isn’t in crisis, focus attention on an emerging competitive threat or find a customer who is willing demand dramatically better due-date performance.

- Align the top team to global, bottom-line oriented measurements (abolish KPAs).
- **Identify your constraint(s)**, based on inventory accumulation, expediting trends and rated capacity.
- Identify your organization's core conflict
- Place expansion plans on hold - all non-essential new equipment, additional headcount etc. ToC implementation will almost certainly release significant spare capacity!
