# What is the goal of the Business?

### What are the necessary conditions?

If any of these three is removed, the others can never be achieved. Our business might make hefty profits in the short-term, but no one will work there very long if we and the employees are dissatisfied. What will happen to profits then? And if the customers are unhappy, they will find alternatives. How long can profits continue to grow and employees continue to be satisfied without any customers? If we define the system goal as any of the above three necessary conditions, the remaining two are automatically required as essential input!  
  
  “Wealth, like happiness, is never attained when sought after directly, it comes as a by-product of providing a useful service.” - Henry Ford  

### What is "The Goal" then?

TOC defines every system in terms of it's Goal. Without a Goal there can be no constraint! 

Not all three necessary conditions are equally measurable. Gauging Employee Satisfaction is not nearly as straightforward as just taking a survey. And customers, no matter how satisfied, always crave for more. Profits, on the other hand, are easily quantifiable in currency units and lend themselves to comparison vs. prior periods. So, for convenience sake, TOC frames the Goal of a publicly traded companies in terms of making more and more money.
