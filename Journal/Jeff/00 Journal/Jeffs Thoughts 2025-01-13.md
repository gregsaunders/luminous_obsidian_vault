# What is the goal of the Business?

### What are the necessary conditions?

If any of these three is removed, the others can never be achieved. Our business might make hefty profits in the short-term, but no one will work there very long if we and the employees are dissatisfied. What will happen to profits then? And if the customers are unhappy, they will find alternatives. How long can profits continue to grow and employees continue to be satisfied without any customers? If we define the system goal as any of the above three necessary conditions, the remaining two are automatically required as essential input!  
  
  “Wealth, like happiness, is never attained when sought after directly, it comes as a by-product of providing a useful service.” - Henry Ford  

### What is "The Goal" then?

TOC defines every system in terms of it's Goal. Without a Goal there can be no constraint! 

Not all three conditions are equally measurable. Gauging Employee Satisfaction is not as straightforward as just taking a survey. Customers, no matter how satisfied, always crave for more. Profits are easily quantifiable in currency units and work well in comparing current to prior periods. For convenience sake, TOC frames the Goal of a publicly traded companies in terms of making more and more money. 

Not-for-profit companies, wholly owned companies, and individual people this is not as straightforward, this requires more introspection to determine our goal. For example, a not-for-profit hospital may exists to heal more and more people, etc. 

##### Examples
- **Goal (Score) -** Happiness; satisfaction of living a full life versus making more money.
- **Purpose (Game)** - Varies; Beauty, mastery, workmanship, helping others, protecting the environment etc. versus Rendering valuable services to customers 
- **Necessary Conditions (Means)** - Secure & Satisfied, healthy, self esteem, family / group versus Secure and satisfied employees, customers, suppliers, investors, lenders, etc. 


# Getting Started

We capitalize on **a crisis**, both with starting the business and the problem we solve. Our problem could be a working capital shortage, potential low profitability, poor customer payments, high-stress high-workload environment, internal conflicts, external crisis in the economy/industry, etc. If we don't anticipate a crisis, we focus attention on competitive threat or over demanding customer who don't fully value our services for what they are.

- Align to bottom-line oriented measurements.
- **Identify our core constraint(s)** ie: Low working capital, access to capital, market adoption timing, start up limitations, capacity restraints etc.
- Determine core constraint that limit us to get this business going. 
- **Exploit** the core constraint, **Subordinate** everything we do to the constraint, then **Elevate the constraint**! To get this thing going, knowing our core constraint, then exploiting the it's maximum efficiency, followed by subordinating everything else to support it,  and last elevating the constraint to overcome limitations. This ensures every effort drives meaningful progress.
- Prevent  **Inertia**  from becoming our constraint. Progress stalls when inertia becomes our new bottleneck! We need to challenge ourselves and ensure our other priorities become the barriers to this success. Momentum is our key to success.
- Place expansion plans on hold until we remove the all non-essential stuff. ToC intention is to ensure we have available capacity to focus on what is most important!
