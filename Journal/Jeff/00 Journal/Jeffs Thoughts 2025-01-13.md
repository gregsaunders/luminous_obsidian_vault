====# What is the goal of the Business?

### What are the necessary conditions? 

![[Journal/Jeff/00 Journal/attachments/Pasted image 20250113075137.png]]
If any of these three is removed, the others can never be achieved. Our business might make hefty profits in the short-term, but no one will work there very long if we and the employees are dissatisfied. What will happen to profits then? And if the customers are unhappy, they will find alternatives. How long can profits continue to grow and employees continue to be satisfied without any customers? If we define the system goal as any of the above three necessary conditions, the remaining two are automatically required as essential input!  
  
  “Wealth, like happiness, is never attained when sought after directly, it comes as a by-product of providing a useful service.” - Henry Ford  

### What is "The Goal" then?

TOC defines every system in terms of it's Goal. Without a Goal there can be no constraint! 

Not all three conditions are equally measurable. Gauging Employee Satisfaction is not as straightforward as just taking a survey. Customers, no matter how satisfied, always crave for more. Profits are easily quantifiable in currency units and work well in comparing current to prior periods. For convenience sake, TOC frames the Goal of a publicly traded companies in terms of making more and more money. 

Not-for-profit companies, wholly owned companies, and individual people this is not as straightforward, this requires more introspection to determine our goal. For example, a not-for-profit hospital may exists to heal more and more people, etc. 

##### Examples
- **Goal (Score) -** Happiness; satisfaction of living a full life versus making more money.
- **Purpose (Game)** - Varies; Beauty, mastery, workmanship, helping others, protecting the environment etc. versus Rendering valuable services to customers 
- **Necessary Conditions (Means)** - Secure & Satisfied, healthy, self esteem, family / group versus Secure and satisfied employees, customers, suppliers, investors, lenders, etc. 


# Getting Started

We capitalize on **a crisis**, both internal (our company) and External (the market we serve). Our problem could be working capital shortage, potential low profitability, poor customer payments, high-stress high-workload environment, internal conflicts, external crisis in the economy/industry, etc. External could be our customers problems like massive liability of tailing pond water, potential environmental disaster, punitive fines, eco terrorism. If we don't anticipate a crisis, we focus attention on competitive threat or over demanding customer who don't see value our services for what they are.

- Align to bottom-line oriented measurements.
- **Identify our core constraint(s)** ie: Low working capital, access to capital, market adoption timing, start up limitations, capacity restraints etc.
- Determine core constraint that limit us to get this business going. 
- **Exploit** the core constraint, **Subordinate** everything we do to the constraint, then **Elevate the constraint**! To get this thing going, knowing our core constraint, then exploiting the it's maximum efficiency, followed by subordinating everything else to support it,  and last elevating the constraint to overcome limitations. This ensures every effort drives meaningful progress.
- Prevent  **Inertia**  from becoming our constraint. Progress stalls when inertia becomes our new bottleneck! We need to challenge ourselves and ensure our other priorities become the barriers to this success. Momentum is our key to success.
- Place expansion plans on hold until we remove the all non-essential stuff. ToC intention is to ensure we have available capacity to focus on what is most important!

# Focus on Constraints

**A constraint is what "limits a system from achieving higher performance versus it's goal"** 

​The constraint is what, if we had just a little more of it, would generate higher Throughput (sometimes referred to as "contribution"). Throughput is a useful way to measure the flow of goods and services to market and to help guide sound decisions and actions to improve it over time.

### Why Do Constraints Matter?
When driving continuous improvement, we are tempting to try to improve everything all at once. As ambitious as this might seem, it rarely leads to sustained improvement in the overall performance of the organization over time.  
  
This is because not all improvements are created equal... a few impact the constraint while most do not. This minor distinction makes all the difference.  

### What constraints are there to consider?
Going by the narrow definition of constraint, ​constraints can only be located in a few specific places:

- **Market Constraint:** is where a company captures the bulk of the market and runs out of further space to grow. For example, De Beers controlled >90% of the global diamond market in the late 1980s. Hence, their growth was governed by the overall size of the diamond market. Regulated electrical utilities or office productivity software are other examples of a market constraint. This type of constraint is quite rare.

- **Demand Constraint:** when market demand at current prices is less than the ability to produce the product or service. This can be indicated by always delivering on-time/in full with no delivery backlog in a make to order environment or maintaining 100% availability of all products / services with negligible wait time in a make-to-stock environment. For example, it is very rare for customers to face retail stockout on popular brands of toothpaste.

- **Internal Capacity Constraint:** when the current ability to deliver is less than market demand for those products or services. This is usually accompanied by a backlog of sales orders, low on-time delivery due date performance, and/or stockouts. The real test of an internal capacity constraint is very high utilization of at least one internal resource (95%+). Note that lots of unsold finished goods in storage may indicate that there is more available capacity than you think!

- **Supply Constraint:** when the system is unable to meet all demand placed upon it due to shortages in the supply available in the market. In most genuine cases, the systemwide consumption of that material, component or item is very high e.g. >50% of the global supply. For example, certain rare earth elements have dwindling availability globally, and can only be found in a single mine located in China. This type of supply constraint is fairly uncommon.  

- **Supplier Constraint:** when the system is unable to meet some demand due to shortages in the supplies by vendors. Most often, what appear to be material constraints are actually caused by internal purchasing policies and practices, rather than a genuine unavailability in the market. Such policies might include restricting purchases to a pre-approved vendor list, only purchasing from lowest price suppliers, extended payment terms, late payment practices, etc. A famous example of a supplier constraint happened at the Royal Philips Plant in Albuquerque, New Mexico. In 2000, a fire at the plant reduced the global supply of key semiconductor chips used in Nokia and Ericsson's flagship cell phones. Through quick action, Nokia was able to tie down additional supply agreements and purchase some of these chips on the open market, effectively locking Ericsson out of the high-end cell phone market for an entire product cycle.

- ​**Cash Constraint:** when the ability to purchase inputs is less than market demand due to inability to pay suppliers. In other words, there is sufficient customer orders, delivery capacity, workers, etc. accompanied by a shortage of inputs/materials/components/etc. Some suppliers may have blacklisted the organization due to late payments, and/or disputes may have been taken to court. In other words, most supplies are available on a payment-first basis only. Therefore a small increase in cash usually can increase sales, throughput, on-time delivery and available cash in a relatively short amount of time, usually less than 13 weeks.

## Key Takeaways About Constraints

In summary, most “operational improvements” achieve negligible financial impact. Yet, certain improvements offer the potential to generate tremendous results!   
​  
One “Active Constraint” governs Throughput at all times. Improvements that affect performance of this constraint impact sales and hence Throughput. Other changes do NOT affect sales. You can locate this active constraint by checking availability/reliability at each link.   
  
Understanding and managing the constraint is a powerful tool for genuinely improving the performance of any organization. Ignore it at your peril. ​Manage your constraint, or it will manage you!
