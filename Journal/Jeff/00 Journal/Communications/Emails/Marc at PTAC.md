Marc,

Following up on Lauren's introduction back in April, I wanted to provide a significant update on our tailings remediation technology.

We have a scientifically validated, Alberta-grown platform that can help your members cost-effectively solve the Naphthenic Acid (NA) tailings challenge and accelerate reclamation timelines.

Since we last connected, two key peer reviewed studies have been published that directly frame our value proposition:

1. Our core biosensor technology was just **published in _ACS Synthetic Biology_**, confirming its effectiveness in raw OSPW.
2. The independent **Kearl wetland study** was also published, identifying a key performance gap (slowing degradation rates) that our bioaugmentation platform is specifically designed to solve.

Our next step is a scale-up pilot, and we are preparing a submission for the **ERA Tailings Technology Challenge**. PTAC's guidance in securing industry partners and navigating the commercialization path would be invaluable.

Would you be open to a brief 15-minute call next week to discuss how this validated technology aligns with PTAC's environmental and technology development objectives?

Thank you,

Jeff Violo

### **Why this email is effective:**

- **Respectful Re-engagement:** It politely references the previous introduction, immediately re-establishing context without being pushy.
- **Provides "New News":** It doesn't just ask for an update; it provides a powerful reason for the follow-up. The publication of two major papers since you last spoke is a compelling reason for him to re-engage.
- **Delivers Immediate Credibility:** Leading with the peer-reviewed publications is the strongest possible hook for a technical audience and demonstrates significant progress.
- **Frames the Win for PTAC:** It clearly states how your solution helps _their members_ and aligns with PTAC's mandate of fostering technology and collaboration.
- **A Clear, Timely "Ask":** The request for a meeting is directly linked to a specific, relevant opportunity (the ERA Challenge) where PTAC's involvement would be highly valuable, creating a clear purpose for the call.
