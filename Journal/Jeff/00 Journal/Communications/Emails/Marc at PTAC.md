Marc,

Following up on Lauren's introduction back in April, I wanted to provide a significant update on our tailings remediation technology.

We have a scientifically validated, Alberta-grown platform that can help your members cost-effectively solve the Naphthenic Acid (NA) tailings challenge and accelerate reclamation timelines.

Since we last connected, two key peer reviewed studies have been published that directly frame our value proposition:

1. Our core biosensor technology was just published in ACS Synthetic Biology, confirming its effectiveness in raw OSPW.
2. The independent Kearl wetland study was also published, identifying a key performance gap (slowing degradation rates) that our bioaugmentation solution is specifically designed to solve.

Our next step is a scale-up pilot, and we are preparing a submission for the ERA Tailings Technology Challenge. PTAC's guidance in securing industry partners and navigating the commercialization path would be invaluable.

Can we schedule a 15-minute call next week to discuss how this validated technology aligns with PTAC's environmental and technology development objectives?

Thank you,

Jeff Violo
