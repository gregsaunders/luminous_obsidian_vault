Hi Theo,

We are excited about the prospect of partnering with CNR on the upcoming ERA call for oil sands water treatment and tailings that you mentioned.

Jayne, it's a pleasure to meet you. We look forward to your input and expertise as we shape this proposal.

We are eager to meet at your earliest convenience to discuss this further. To make the best use of your time, we can come prepared to briefly cover:

1. A recap of the success of the biosensor technology that CNRL's funding helped us develop, which has now been validated and published in the peer-reviewed journal, ACS Synthetic Biology.
2. Key insights from the recently published Kearl constructed wetland study, and how our bioaugmentation strategy directly addresses the performance gaps (i.e., slowing degradation rates) identified in the report.
3. Our high-level project plan for the upcoming ERA water treatment and tailings grant, and how a partnership with CNRL would create a powerful submission.

Please let us know what day or time works best for you and Jayne for a brief call next week. We are flexible and can work around your team's schedule.

This work is the natural evolution of the successful research CNRL initially supported, and we're looking forward to discussing the next steps.

Best regards,

Dr. Shawn Lewenza Chief Science Officer Luminous BioSolutions Inc.
