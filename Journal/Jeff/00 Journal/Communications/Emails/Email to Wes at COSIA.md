Wes,

I'm writing to you directly as my team has developed a scientifically-validated, cost-effective platform to solve the Naphthenic Acid (NA) challenge, and we believe it can significantly accelerate Pathways' environmental performance goals.

Our core biosensor technology, initially supported by CNR and Imperial, was just **published in the peer-reviewed journal, _ACS Synthetic Biology_**. We use this rapid detection to guide a targeted, nature-based remediation that directly addresses the performance gaps (i.e., slowing degradation rates) identified in the recent Kearl wetland study.

We are preparing a submission for the upcoming **ERA Tailings Technology Challenge** and are seeking an executive sponsor. We are already engaged with Ty Veness and technical teams at your member companies, and believe a partnership with Pathways would create a formidable proposal.

Are you the right person to discuss this, or could you please point me to who is? We would be happy to schedule a brief 15-minute call to outline the opportunity.

Thank you,

**Jeff Violo** Co-founder | Chief Operating Officer Luminous BioSolutions Inc. 403-813-8529 [Link to your Luminous BioSolutions Website]
