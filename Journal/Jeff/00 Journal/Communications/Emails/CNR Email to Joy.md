**Subject: Reconnecting & An Update on the Naphthenic Acid Biosensor Research**

Dear Joy,

I hope this email finds you well.

I’m writing to reconnect and share some exciting developments that stem directly from the research into Naphthenic Acid biosensors that Canadian Natural was instrumental in supporting at the U of C and Athabasca University over a decade ago. Your team’s vision and support were critical, and I'm thrilled to report that the project has matured into a success.

The biosensor technology has now been scientifically validated, and our work on its construction and successful testing in raw OSPW was recently published in the peer-reviewed journal, ACS Synthetic Biology.

This success was the catalyst for us to start up Luminous BioSolutions, an Alberta-based company dedicated to commercializing this technology. We have since evolved our model beyond detection adding near real-time data from our biosensors to guide a bioaugmentation solution. Essentially we are planning to use nature's own processes to accelerate NA degradation in a smarter, data-driven way.

Our timing feels more relevant than ever as the recent, study released on the Kearl constructed wetland validated the effectiveness of nature-based degradation but also highlighted key performance gaps like degradation rates slowing over time which our solution intends to solve.

One of the reasons for my email is to explore CNR's interest in this next chapter. There are time sensitive grant opportunities this summer, including the Emissions Reduction Alberta (ERA) Tailings Technology call, that require an industry partner. 

Given CNR’s foundational role in this journey, and the need for NA Testing and Remediation, a collaboration to pilot and deploy this technology would be incredibly fitting.

Would you be open to a brief meeting with you and your team in the coming week or two? I would welcome the opportunity to bring you up to speed on how the technology you helped incubate has evolved into a full-scale, cost-effective remediation platform and discuss how a partnership could directly support CNR's reclamation goals.

Thank you again for your early support. It truly was instrumental in getting us to this exciting stage.

Best regards,

Dr. Shawn Lewenza

Chief Science Officer

### **Why this email works:**

- **Respectful Opening:** It immediately acknowledges and validates her and CNR's past contribution.
- **Delivers the "Payoff":** It frames the update as a success story that their initial investment created, leading with the powerful credibility of a peer-reviewed publication in a top journal.
- **Shows Strategic Evolution:** It clearly explains the logical next step from a successful sensor to a full-service remediation platform, showing business maturity.
- **Demonstrates Industry Awareness:** Referencing the Kearl study shows you are aligned with current industry research and solving a documented, relevant problem.
- **The "Ask" is Collaborative:** It’s not "we need you," but rather "a partnership would be fitting." It positions CNR as a potential leader, not just a sponsor.
- **Urgency is Justified:** The mention of specific, time-sensitive grants like ERA's provides a legitimate business reason for the request to meet soon, without sounding like a high-pressure sales tactic.
- **Professional & Concise:** It respects her time by getting to the point quickly while telling a compelling story.
