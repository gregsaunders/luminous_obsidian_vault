### Infrastructure Domain 
The infrastructure domain classifies low-level software and hardware required to build, deploy and support higher-level Applications that deliver Business Capabilities.

The primary component types in this domain are technology service and server. It is important to understand that these represent actual physical deployments of this hardware and software, and not just their type, version or make/models – these are defined in the technology catalog domain.

**Technology Service Component** - A technology service represents the bundling of specific software with hardware to provide a predefined deployable building-block for an IT system. When provided by a third party it may be referred to as Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) or Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS).

**Server Component** - A server is a unit of computing hardware dedicated to managing network resources. Servers may be specialized by function (for example an application server, a database server, an email server or a web server) depending on their hardware configuration or the software products deployed onto them.

Servers may also be classified as virtual or physical depending on whether virtualization software is deployed. But ultimately a physical server underlies any configuration.

**Node Component** - A node represents a grouping or cluster of infrastructure resources managed as a single or combined resource.


### Luminous Infrastructure Recommendations:

1. **Cloud-First, Hybrid-Option Approach:**  
   - Begin with a reputable cloud provider (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP) for core infrastructure services.  
   - Leverage Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) for virtual servers and Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) components (like managed databases) to minimize upfront capital and simplify scaling.  
   - Retain flexibility to move certain workloads on-premise or to a private cloud environment if stringent data residency or compliance needs arise.

2. **Technology Services for Core Building Blocks:**  
   - **Compute Services:**  
     - Start with a small cluster of virtualized application servers (nodes) managed through container orchestration (e.g., Kubernetes or a managed service like AWS ECS or Azure AKS).  
     - Use auto-scaling groups to dynamically adjust resources based on actual load, maintaining cost efficiency.
  
   - **Storage & Database Services:**  
     - Implement a managed database service (e.g., AWS RDS, Azure SQL Database) for core structured data.  
     - Use object storage (e.g., S3, Azure Blob Storage) for raw lab data, reports, and large unstructured datasets.  
     - Consider a managed data warehouse (e.g., BigQuery, Snowflake) or a serverless analytics service for long-term analytical storage, ensuring you only pay for what you use.

   - **Networking & Security:**  
     - Utilize virtual private clouds (VPCs), subnets, and network security groups to isolate environments (development, staging, production).  
     - Employ managed firewalls, load balancers, and identity/access management services to enforce security policies and ensure regulatory compliance.  
     - Integrate a reliable VPN or Direct Connect link if on-prem lab environments require secure, low-latency access to cloud resources.

3. **Server and Node Configurations:**  
   - Start small with one or two virtualized application nodes that host APIs, processing pipelines, and web front ends.  
   - Use containerization to package applications and their dependencies, allowing quick scaling horizontally by adding more identical container instances to the cluster.  
   - Introduce additional nodes or node pools for specialized tasks—e.g., compute-intensive bioinformatics workloads could run on GPU-enabled nodes or spot instances for cost savings.

4. **DevOps and Automation:**  
   - Implement a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or Azure DevOps) integrated with infrastructure-as-code (e.g., Terraform, Pulumi) to deploy and update infrastructure consistently.  
   - Use configuration management tools (e.g., Ansible) to standardize environments, reducing human error and manual effort.

5. **Cost Management & Scalability:**
   - Start with small, cost-effective instance types and scale up or out only as demand increases.  
   - Leverage serverless technologies (e.g., AWS Lambda, Azure Functions) for on-demand computations that do not require permanent server uptime.  
   - Regularly review usage metrics and apply cost optimization strategies like reserved instances, spot instances, or scaling policies that turn off non-critical environments after business hours.

6. **Monitoring & Reliability:**
   - Implement robust monitoring (e.g., CloudWatch, Azure Monitor) and logging (e.g., ELK stack, managed logging services) from the outset to track performance, detect issues, and maintain SLAs.  
   - Integrate alerting and incident response playbooks to ensure rapid resolution of downtime or performance degradation events.

By adopting a flexible, cloud-first infrastructure combined with containerization, managed services, and strong DevOps practices, this startup can maintain cost efficiency, ensure reliability, and easily scale resources to meet growing client demand. This foundational approach provides both the agility to innovate quickly and the resilience to handle increased workloads as the business expands.
