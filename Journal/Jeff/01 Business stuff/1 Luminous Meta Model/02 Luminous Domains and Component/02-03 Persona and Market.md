### Persona's Domain 
The **personas domain** is used to model the abstracted properties of the organization’s target customers, consumers or community members. Digital businesses and organizations have increasingly shifted to become consumer-centric, and key to this shift is understanding the needs, preferences and concerns of the people they exist or aspire to serve.

- **Persona Component** - A persona represents an abstracted description (i.e. not a real person) representative of a segment of the organization’s current or target customer base. Personas are in some ways similar to roles, in that they describe behaviours abstracted from actual people. But unlike roles, personas seek to personify their descriptions by also describing state of mind, emotional needs and responses, lifestyle preferences and other contextual information. Doing this ensures that the organization adapts to the individual’s requirements, unlike a role which specifies what the organization requires from an individual.

### Markets Domain
The **markets domain** is used to describe spaces or forums through which the organization transacts the buying and selling of goods and services, rather than interacting directly with customers or external organizations. Because many such markets are now automated with their own information and technical interoperability requirements, the markets domain has been placed in the physical-automated column.

- **Market Component** - A **market** it is a space where buyers and sellers meet to transact the exchange of products and services. Traditionally markets were physical spaces where prices and terms of exchange were negotiated fact-to-face. In the twenty-first century markets are increasingly virtual (i.e. accessed via a communications network) and automated (i.e. buying and selling is carried out via applications and algorithms).

### Luminous Personas Domain

1. **Environmental Compliance Officer Persona**  
   - **Demographic/Context:** Works for a major oil sands operator; often collaborates with regulatory bodies.  
   - **Motivations:** Needs to ensure tailings pond water meets strict environmental standards; aims to reduce the risk of non-compliance fines and negative public scrutiny.  
   - **Pain Points:** Current testing methods are slow, costly, and sometimes inaccurate. Difficulty getting real-time data leads to delays in decision-making.  
   - **Goals:** Rapid and reliable detection of naphthenic acids to maintain compliance, reduce costs, and support sustainable environmental practices.

2. **Water Treatment Engineer Persona**  
   - **Demographic/Context:** Employed by an environmental consulting firm or directly by the oil sands operation’s water treatment team.  
   - **Motivations:** Improve efficiency and effectiveness of water treatment solutions; seeks tools that simplify identifying and managing NA-degrading microbes.  
   - **Pain Points:** Complexities in optimizing microbial communities; guesswork in treatment processes due to limited real-time indicators.  
   - **Goals:** Quick, data-driven decision-making tools to fine-tune treatment processes, reduce trial-and-error, and improve ecological outcomes.

3. **Regulatory Agency Scientist Persona**  
   - **Demographic/Context:** Works for a governmental environmental regulatory body in Canada.  
   - **Motivations:** Ensure public health and ecosystem integrity by enforcing stringent water quality standards.  
   - **Pain Points:** Limited visibility into on-the-ground compliance; reliance on spot-check sampling methods that may not capture full variability.  
   - **Goals:** Access to standardized, validated biosensor data streams to support evidence-based policy and give timely feedback to operators.

### Luminous Markets Domain
