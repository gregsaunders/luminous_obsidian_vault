#### The core market, proposition and operations concepts are broken down into three **realization columns.**

The organizationâ€™s business model has requirements for markets, propositions and operations, and these can be expressed independently of how they are fulfilled (since this will change over time). These requirements live in the **logical column**.

Those logical requirements may be realized by people, manual processes and physical locations, which are described in the **physical-manual column**.

And they may also be realized by machines, digital assets and processes and virtual locations, which are described in the **physical-automated column**.

Over time, automation will shift the balance of realized propositions and operations from physical-manual to physical-automated.

So IT systems and business organizations are seen to be equivalent realizations of the core business model. This aligns to the reality of digital business.

**Logical Column** - Describes core business concepts, activities and behaviours agnostic of how they are realized. Logical information and business capabilities are shared between physical-manual and physical-automated while technology capabilities and roles are equivalent
**Physical-automated Column** - Describes the realization of logical business and technical concepts by machines and digital assets, or in a form optimized for use by machines.
**Physical-manual Column** - Describes the realization of logical business concepts and activities by people and physical assets and environments, or in a form optimized for use by people.
