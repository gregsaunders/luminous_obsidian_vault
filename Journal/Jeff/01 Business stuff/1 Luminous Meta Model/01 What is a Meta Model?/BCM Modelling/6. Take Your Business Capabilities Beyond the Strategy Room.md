#### Taking Your Business Capabilities Beyond the Strategy Room

**What** - Socialize your business capability analysis with decision makers
**Who** - Enterprise Architects, Business Strategists, IT Strategists, PMO, Business Risk, Innovation, Human Resources and more
**How** - Workshops, Ardoq Presentations, Third-party BI Tools

#### Socialize the Results of Your Analysis
You can do this a number of ways, including using Ardoq’s own Presentations and Dashboards as well as integration with Third-party Business Intelligence tools like Microsoft’s PowerBI.

However you choose to do so, the model really comes to life when you start to take it around stakeholders and play their concerns through the lens of your business capabilities.

#### Who Do You Socialize It With and Why

Well, your PMO team. Discuss how project investment aligns to the model: Are we over-investing in commodity capabilities and under-investing in differentiating ones. Are we polishing mature capabilities and neglecting underdeveloped ones?

Or Business Risk or CISO. How are risks impacting these capabilities? How material are those risks? Are we building our security perimeters and controls in the right places?

Or Innovation. Are we innovating in differentiating capabilities? If we are innovating in commodity capabilities, why?

Is it because we’re prioritizing low-value innovations, or have we underestimated the competitive value of one of our capabilities?

Or IT Architecture. Do we have technical strategies to address key capability gaps? Are IT and Business Strategy aligned in terms of investment and objectives?

Or HR. Are we building skills in the right places? Do we have critical skill gaps or single-points-of failure? Are there knowledge-sharing or training mechanisms we should be investing in?

#### As with any conversation like this, discussions can quickly turn political.
The best way forward is to proceed as a collaborator, not an antagonist. In general, people are just glad to have a framework for airing their own concerns. And the more people who use the model the more credible it will become.

Finally, if you need senior sponsorship to have these discussions, always come back to this: Your Business Capability map enables you to tell all of your critical organizational stories on a single page. That’s its real power.
