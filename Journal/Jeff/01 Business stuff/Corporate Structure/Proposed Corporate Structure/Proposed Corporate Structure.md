### Company 1: The Research and Development Company (R&D Company)

**Purpose:**
- Own the intellectual property (IP) and patents for the biosensor.
- Conduct ongoing research to enhance existing technology and develop new products.

**Ownership:**
- **Sole Ownership by Shaun (Researcher):**  
    Shaun should own 100% of the voting shares to maintain control and safeguard the IP. This ensures that his innovations and future directions for research are protected.

**Equity Considerations for Others:**
- To align interests, **Greg and Jeff could hold non-voting shares** (e.g., preferred shares) in the R&D company.
    - These shares could entitle them to dividends or profit sharing but not influence decision-making regarding the IP.
    - The equity split could be proportional to their involvement or negotiated to incentivize them to contribute to the long-term health of this entity.

**Structure Rationale:**
- This approach protects the research-driven mission of the company while providing Greg and Jeff a financial incentive to support its success.

### Company 2: The Commercialization Company

**Purpose:**
- Market, sell, and provide services using the biosensor technology.
- Own the customer relationships and handle operational activities such as billing, customer support, and market intelligence.

**Ownership and Governance:**
- **Equal Ownership by Shaun, Greg, and Jeff:**  
    Each founder could hold **33.3% equity**, promoting equal alignment and responsibility.
    
- **Decision-Making Structure:**
    - Create a **shareholders’ agreement** with clearly defined roles and responsibilities for each founder.
    - Include provisions to resolve disputes (e.g., mediation or arbitration clauses).
    - Define a voting structure for major decisions, ensuring none of the founders has unilateral control.

**Governance Roles:**
- Shaun: Provide insights into technology development and maintain strong communication between both companies.
- Greg: Lead technological implementation and software platform development.
- Jeff: Focus on business development, customer acquisition, and operational strategy.

**Licensing Agreement:**
- The R&D company should grant **exclusive commercialization rights** to the Commercialization Company.
- This agreement should outline royalty payments or profit-sharing terms between the two entities to ensure a revenue stream for the R&D company.

### Structuring the Relationship Between the Two Companies

1. **Inter-company Agreement:**
    - Establish clear terms for how the Commercialization Company will access the technology (e.g., royalties, licensing fees, or a revenue-sharing model).
    - This ensures a steady income for the R&D company while incentivizing the Commercialization Company to scale operations.

1. **Shared Vision Statement:**
    - Define a joint mission that aligns both companies’ goals. This can help prevent conflicts and maintain focus on collective success.

1. **Conflict Resolution Framework:**
    - Develop a structured process for resolving disputes, potentially through an external advisor or board member.

1. **Board Composition:**
    - Consider appointing an independent advisor to the board of the Commercialization Company. This person can act as a mediator and bring an impartial perspective to decisions.

### Additional Recommendations

    - Profit-sharing arrangements between the companies.
    - Exit strategies for founders (e.g., buyout options or transfer of shares).

- **Profit Alignment:** Consider a profit-sharing mechanism between the two companies to ensure that the success of one supports the other.
