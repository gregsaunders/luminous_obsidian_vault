Hereâ€™s a structured approach:

### Playbook for Defining IT Strategy and Governance Framework

#### 1. Understand Business Goals and Environment
   - **Cynefin Framework**: Use this to understand the business environment and challenges. It helps in classifying problems into simple, complicated, complex, and chaotic domains, guiding how to approach IT strategy in each scenario.
   - **Stakeholder Interviews/Workshops**: Conduct sessions to understand business objectives, challenges, and expectations from IT.

#### 2. Develop IT Strategy
   - **Alignment with Business Strategy**: Ensure that the IT strategy is in line with the overall business strategy and objectives [[Journal/Jeff/01 Business stuff/1 Luminous Meta Model/02 Luminous Domains and Component/02-01 Strategy and Objectives]].
   - **Use of BPMN**: Employ BPMN for visualizing and documenting IT processes, making them clear and understandable for both IT and business stakeholders.
   - **Scenario Planning**: Consider various business scenarios and plan how IT can support these situations.

#### 3. Implement a Governance Framework
   - **Ardoq Metamodel Layers and Columns**: Use this to structure your IT governance framework. It will help in defining different layers (like Market, Proposition, Process, etc.) and columns (Physical-automated, Logical, Physical-manual) for a comprehensive governance structure.

   - **Roles and Responsibilities**: Clearly define IT governance roles and responsibilities, ensuring accountability and effective decision-making.

#### 4. Establish IT Policies and Procedures
   - **Documenting Policies**: Create clear and concise IT policies covering areas like cybersecurity, data management, and IT resource usage.
   - **Procedures for Compliance**: Ensure procedures are in place for regulatory compliance and standards adherence.

   - **Roadmap Development**: Create a strategic roadmap with timelines for implementation of IT strategies and governance policies.

#### 6. Communication and Training
   - **Effective Communication**: Develop a communication plan to convey the IT strategy and governance framework to stakeholders.
   - **Training Programs**: Implement training programs for IT and other staff to understand new policies, procedures, and governance frameworks.

#### 7. Monitor and Review
   - **Feedback Mechanisms**: Establish feedback mechanisms for continuous improvement.
   - **Regular Reviews**: Schedule regular reviews of the IT strategy and governance framework to ensure alignment with evolving business goals.

#### 8. Leverage Technology and Data
   - **Data-Driven Decision Making**: Utilize data analytics for informed decision-making.
   - **Technology Adoption**: Stay updated with emerging technologies that can enhance business operations and IT effectiveness.
