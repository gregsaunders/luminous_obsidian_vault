Creating a plan for the execution of IT strategies and governance policies in a startup oil and gas company involves using user story mapping for visualization and developing a strategic roadmap. Here's a detailed plan:

### 1. User Story Mapping for IT Initiatives

**Steps**:
   - **Gather Requirements**: Conduct sessions with stakeholders from different business units to understand their needs and expectations from IT.
   - **Create User Stories**: Develop user stories that represent different IT requirements and initiatives. Each story should reflect a specific need or problem to be addressed by IT.
   - **Organize Stories**: Arrange the user stories along a horizontal axis in the order they should be addressed. This sequence often represents the flow of activities from the userâ€™s perspective.
   - **Prioritize and Group**: Prioritize stories based on factors like business value, urgency, and dependencies. Group related stories to form epics or themes.
   - **Identify Milestones**: Establish key milestones in the story map which represent major deliverables or phases in IT deployment.
   - **Engage Stakeholders**: Regularly review the story map with stakeholders for feedback and adjustments.

### 2. Developing a Strategic IT Roadmap

**Steps**:
   - **Define Strategic Objectives**: Align the roadmap with the strategic objectives of the company. Each element of the roadmap should contribute to these objectives.

   - **Incorporate Story Mapping Outcomes**: Integrate the priorities and sequences identified in the user story mapping into the roadmap.
   - **Detail Initiatives**: Break down each initiative into actionable tasks or projects, assigning responsible teams or individuals.
   - **Resource Allocation**: Plan for resource allocation, including budget, personnel, and technology, for each initiative.
   - **Set Milestones and KPIs**: Define clear milestones for each initiative and establish Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to measure progress and success.
   - **Risk Assessment and Mitigation**: Identify potential risks for each initiative and develop mitigation strategies.
   - **Review and Adaptation Mechanism**: Incorporate a regular review process to adapt the roadmap as per changing business needs, technological advancements, and feedback.

### 3. Communication and Implementation

**Purpose**: To ensure that the execution plan is communicated effectively across the organization and implemented efficiently.

**Steps**:
   - **Communicate the Plan**: Present the roadmap to all relevant stakeholders, ensuring clarity on expectations, roles, and timelines.

   - **Project Management**: Utilize project management tools and methodologies to manage the execution of each initiative.
   - **Regular Updates and Reporting**: Provide regular updates to stakeholders on the progress of initiatives, incorporating feedback into ongoing projects.
   - **Training and Support**: Offer necessary training and support to employees for new systems and processes.

### 4. Monitoring and Evaluation

**Purpose**: To continuously monitor the execution of the IT roadmap and evaluate its impact.

**Steps**:
   - **Performance Tracking**: Use the defined KPIs to track the performance and impact of each IT initiative.
   - **Adjustments Based on Feedback**: Make adjustments to the roadmap and individual initiatives based on performance data and stakeholder feedback.
   - **Lessons Learned**: Document lessons learned from completed initiatives to inform future projects and roadmap revisions.
