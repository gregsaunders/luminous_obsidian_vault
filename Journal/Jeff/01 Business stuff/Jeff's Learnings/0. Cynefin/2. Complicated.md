# Complicated Contexts – "The Domain of Experts"

"Complicated" problems might have several "correct" solutions. Here, there is a clear relationship between cause and effect, but it may not be visible to everyone, because the problem is... complicated. For example, you might see several symptoms of a problem but not know how to fix it.

The decision-making approach here is to "Sense – Analyze – Respond." In other words, you need to assess the situation, analyze what is known (often with the help of experts), and decide on the best response, using good practice.

**Leaders may rely too heavily on experts in complicated situations, while dismissing or overlooking creative solutions from other people.** To overcome this, assemble a team of people from a wide variety of backgrounds (including [rebels](https://www.mindtools.com/arwbjr1/managing-rebels) and dissenters), and use tools such as [Crawford's Slip Writing Method](https://www.mindtools.com/a4oopmg/crawfords-slip-writing-method) to ensure that everyone's views are heard.
