# Chaotic Contexts – "The Domain of Rapid Response"

In "chaotic" situations, no relationship between cause and effect exists, so your primary goal is to establish order and stability. Crisis and emergency scenarios often fall into this domain.

The decision-making approach here is to "Act – Sense – Respond." You need to act decisively to address the most pressing issues, sense where there is stability and where there isn't, and then respond to move the situation from chaos to complexity.

To navigate chaotic situations successfully, conduct a [Risk Analysis](https://www.mindtools.com/abhkwcn/risk-analysis-and-risk-management) to identify possible risks, prioritize them with a [Risk Impact/Probability Chart](https://www.mindtools.com/community/pages/article/newPPM_78.php), and make sure that you have a comprehensive [crisis plan](https://www.mindtools.com/arjwer3/planning-for-a-crisis) in place. It's impossible to prepare for every situation, but planning for identifiable risks is often helpful.

Reliable information is critical in uncertain and chaotic situations, so make sure you know how to [communicate in a crisis](https://www.mindtools.com/asovf6t/communicating-in-a-crisis).
