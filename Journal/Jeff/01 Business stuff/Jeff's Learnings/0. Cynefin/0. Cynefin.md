# Cynefin

#### Key Points

The Cynefin framework was developed by David J. Snowden in 1999. It aims to help leaders understand that every situation is different and requires a unique approach to decision making.

The framework outlines five situational domains that are defined by cause-and-effect relationships. They are:

- Obvious.
- Complicated.
- Complex.
- Chaotic.
- Disorder.

Each of these domains has a specific decision-making approach that helps you make better sense of the situation, and choose the most appropriate way forward.

Cynefin, pronounced "ku-nev-in," is a Welsh word that translates as "place" or "habitat." However, it can also be used to describe the elements of our situation and personal history that influence our thoughts and decisions in ways we don't understand.

The Cynefin framework (Figure 1 below) is a problem-solving tool that helps you put situations into five "domains" defined by cause-and-effect relationships. This helps you assess your situation more accurately and respond appropriately.

You can use the Cynefin framework in a variety of situations to categorize a problem or decision and respond accordingly. For example, it is useful in product development, marketing and organizational strategy. It can also help you make better decisions in a crisis or emergency.

It helps you avoid using the same management style or decision-making approach in all situations – a mistake that can be costly to your team or organization– by encouraging you to be flexible and adaptable when making decisions, and to adjust your management style to fit your circumstances.
