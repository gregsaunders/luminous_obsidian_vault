# Complex Contexts – "The Domain of Emergence"

It might be impossible to identify one "correct" solution, or spot cause-and-effect relationships, in "complex" situations. According to Snowden and Boone, **many business situations fall into this category.**

Complex contexts are often unpredictable, and the best approach here is to "Probe – Sense – Respond." **Rather than trying to control the situation or insisting on a plan of action, it's often best to be patient, look for patterns, and encourage a solution to emerge.**

It can be helpful to conduct [business experiments](https://www.mindtools.com/a26g880/business-experiments) in these situations, and **accept failure as part of the learning process.** Make sure that you have processes in place to guide your team's thinking – even a simple set of rules can lead to better solutions than no guidance at all.

Communication is essential here, too. Gather a diverse group of people to come up with innovative, creative solutions to complex problems. Use brainstorming tools such as [Random Input](https://www.mindtools.com/community/pages/article/newCT_07.php) or [Provocation](https://www.mindtools.com/community/pages/article/newCT_08.php) to generate new ideas, and encourage your team to debate the possibilities.

### Note
Complicated and complex situations are similar in some ways, and it can be challenging to tell which of them you're experiencing. However, if you need to make a decision based on incomplete data, for example, you're likely to be in a complex situation.
