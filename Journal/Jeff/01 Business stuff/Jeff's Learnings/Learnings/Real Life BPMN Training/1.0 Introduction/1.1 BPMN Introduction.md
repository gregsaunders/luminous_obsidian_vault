#### BPMN Definition - European Association of BPM (EABPM)  

*Business process management (BPM) is a systemic approach for capturing, designing, executing, documenting, measuring, monitoring, and controlling both automated and non-automated processes to meet the objectives and business strategies of a company. BPM embraces the conscious, comprehensive, and increasingly technology-enabled definition, improvement, innovation, and maintenance of end- to-end processes. Through this systemic and conscious management of processes, companies achieve better results faster and more flexibly.*

*Through BPM, processes can be aligned with the business strategy, and so help to improve company performance as a whole thanks to the optimization of processes within business divisions or even beyond company borders.*

What end-to-end process really means is from start to finish. The goal is to understand and thus to assess and improve an entire process not just its components. The EABPM’s definition helps because it treats automated and non-automated processes as both equally important and equally subject to the power of BPM. This understanding is essential to applying BPM successfully because it is rarely sufficient to improve only organizational procedures or the supporting technologies; most often we must improve both the procedures and the technology cooperatively.

#### BPMN In Practice
New BPMN projects almost always involve one of the following three scenarios:

1. The client wants to improve a process using InformationTechnology (IT)
2. The client wants current processes documented.  
3. The client wants to introduce entirely new processes.

The majority of the time clients seeks to improve a process with IT. The motivation often is a desire to improve efficiency like using software to eliminate manual keying or re-keying of data. A client may want to implement IT-based monitoring and analysis of routine processes based on key performance indicators (KPIs).

The second scenario, documenting processes, usually comes about because the client needs the documentation to guide the work of the people involved. Another rationale is that the documentation is mandated by regulation or required to obtain certification such as ISO 9000.

The third scenario happens least often. We find that when companies want to introduce entirely new processes, it is usually because they are being forced to adapt to changed market conditions, develop new channels of distribution, or introduce new products.

In public announcements, companies may speak in generalities: they have an interest in exploring BPM or they want to increase their process orientation. In practice, especially in large organizations, the argument for BPM is usually well-defined and specific, but it can take two forms:

1. There is an acute reason for using BPM. The project concerns essential processes that need to be created, improved, or documented
2. The reason for BPM is strategic. There will be no direct or immediate benefit, and the project likely was initiated by some manager trying to advance his or her career.

Serious people don’t greet the second argument with enthusiasm. It is our own experience, however, which makes us advocate for this view strongly: BPM, process management, or whatever you want to call it, is not an end in itself.

We always recommend introducing BPM in steps. Each step should yield a practical, measurable benefit that justifies the time and effort that it took to accomplish. Once the justification of the first step is established, take the next step. You may think that this approach produces solutions isolated from each other, but what we mean to emphasize here is the controlled nature of the approach. Each step contributes to the big picture: the company’s process orientation. A hiker may use a map and a compass to guide his or her steps. Like- wise, when you introduce BPM, you should use a good procedure model and common sense as your guides.

#### Camunda BPM life cycle
Procedure models always seem to be either too simple or too complex. The overly-simple ones contain only the most painfully obvious elements. They may be useful for marketing presentations, but not much else. On the other hand, overly complex models work so hard at anticipating every contingency that they trap the user like a fly in amber. They are unrealistically rigid. Still, without a model, we wouldn’t have our map to orient ourselves.

After examining the simple BPM life cycle, which is the most well-established BPM procedure model, we refined it according to our experience. We wanted to create a relatively lightweight model without too many restrictions. We thought this would be more prac- tical than the brightly colored marketing materials we see so often at conferences and in meetings. We call ours the Camunda BPM life cycle. See it in figure 1.1.

We intend the Camunda BPM life cycle to describe one process at a time. Any process can run through the life cycle independently of any other process, and the process can be at a different stage each time it repeats. The cycle triggers when one of the following situations arises:

- An existing process is to be documented or improved.
- A new process is to be introduced.

We have to start by examining an existing process. The process discovery clearly differen- tiates the subject process from other processes both upstream and downstream. The dis- covery reveals the output generated by the subject process as well as the importance of that output for the client. We use e.g. workshops or one-on-one interviews to identify not only what needs to be accomplished, but also who needs to be involved, and which IT systems.

We document the findings from the process discovery in a current state process model. This process documentation may include many different charts and descriptions; it usu- ally has multiple flow charts. A systematic examination of the current state process clearly identifies weak points and their causes.

We conduct process analysis either because first-time documentation or continuous pro- cess control has revealed a weakness of a process that cannot be remedied easily.

The causes of weak points identified by a process analysis become the starting point for another process design. If necessary, different process designs can be evaluated by means of the process simulation. We also conduct a process design when introducing a new process. The result in either case is a target state process model.

In reality, we normally want to implement the target state process model as a change in business or organizational procedures as well as an IT project. Change management, especially process communication, plays a decisive role in successful organizational change. For the IT implementation, the process can be automated or software can be developed, adapted, or procured. The result of the process implementation is a current state process corresponding to the target state process model that, conveniently, has already been documented.

In most cases, we find all the stages from process discovery to process implementation to be necessary. Because process monitoring takes place continuously, however, it reveals more about the ongoing operation of the process.

The most important tasks of process control are the continuous monitoring of individual process instances and the analysis of key data so that weak points can be recognized as quickly as possible. Problems with individual entities require direct remedies, and so do structural problems if that’s possible. If necessary, the current state process model has to be adjusted.

If the structural causes of the problems are unclear or complex, this calls for an improvement project that once again starts with a systematic process analysis of the weak points. The decision to initiate such a project lies with the process owner and anyone else who depends on the process. It is common to regard continuous process control as some-thing that follows process implementation, though it may be better to have it follow the initial documentation. This is especially true when doubt exists about the necessity of the improvement.

Given the importance of the process model within the BPM life cycle, you can imagine the importance of a modeling standard such as BPMN. Yet you may also notice that process modeling is not a stage in the Camunda BPM life cycle. That’s because process modeling is a method that affects all stages, especially process documentation and process design. As consultants, we constantly encounter people who try to insert process modeling as a stage at the same level as current state documentation. We think that’s a misconception.

The BPM life cycle describes a simple way to achieve continuous improvement. Applying it requires coordination of the triad: The responsible parties, the applied methods, and the supporting software tools. Getting the triad moving toward a common goal is the task of BPM governance, which has authority over all processes and all BPM projects in an organization.

The EABPM’s definition of BPM used the term process automation, and we’ve also used that term in describing the Camunda BPM life cycle. BPMN was developed to automate processes better. Even if you are not an IT expert, you need to understand what process automation means because it will help you to grasp how BPMN builds bridges between business and technology

#### Process automation

Here’s a simple process: A potential bank customer mails a paper credit application, which ends up on the desk of a bank accountant. The accountant examines the application, then checks the potential customer’s creditworthiness through the web site of a credit rating agency. The results are positive, so the accountant records the application in a special software let’s call it BankSoft and then forwards the documents to a manager for approval.

Here’s the same process automated: A potential bank customer mails a paper credit application. At the bank, a clerk scans the application into electronic form. Software known as a workflow engine takes over the document and routes it to the bank accountant’s virtual task list. The accountant accesses the task list, perhaps through the bank’s web site or an email program like Microsoft Outlook, examines the application on screen, then clicks a button. The workflow engine accesses the credit rating agency, transfers the pertinent details, and receives the report. Since the report is positive, the engine passes the information to BankSoft, and it creates an approval task in the manager’s task list.

Whether this example represents optimal processing is not the point. It’s here only to illustrate the following principles of process automation:

- Process automation does not necessarily mean that the entire process is fully automated.
- The central component of process automation is the workflow engine, which executes an executable process model.
- The workflow engine controls the process by informing humans of tasks that they need to do, and it handles the result of what the people do. (This is human workflow management.) It also communicates with internal and external IT systems. (This is service orchestration.)
- The workflow engine decides which tasks or service calls take place or not, under what conditions, and according to the result of the task execution or service call. Thus the people involved still can influence the operational sequence of an automated process.

Figure 1.2 below illustrates these principles.

If you think that process automation is just a kind of software development, you are right. The workflow engine is the compiler or interpreter, and the executable process model is the program code. A workflow engine is the mechanism of choice where process automation is concerned.

- **The workflow engine specializes in representing process logic.** The services it provides would have required extensive programming in the past; using a workflow engine now can make you considerably more productive than before. (Or perhaps productivity is not an issue for you, and so you develop your own spreadsheet, word-processing, and drawing programs!)
- **A workflow engine combines workflow management with application integration**. This makes it a powerful tool for implementing all kinds of processes from start to end, regardless of other applications or the geography of people in the process. In some BPM software solutions, we can add a separate Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) or other components to the workflow engine to make the whole more versatile.
- **As the workflow engine controls the process, it tracks everything.** It always knows the current stage of the process and how long each task took to complete. Because the workflow engine monitors key performance indicators directly, it provides a means to analyze performance as well. This offers huge potential for successful process control.

The three features above would themselves justify using a workflow engine, but there is a fourth justification: The workflow engine works on the basis of an executable process model. In the best cases, this model can be developed —or at least understood —by some- one who is not a technician. This promotes genuinely good communication between busi- ness and IT, and it can even result in process documentation that corresponds to reality.
