## **The dilemma** 

First, BPMN provides a set of symbols. Second, it implies a methodology that expresses itself as rules for combining the symbols graphically. Third, the symbol definitions and the rules for applying them is called syntax. Fourth, the meaning of the symbols and constructs that you can model with the symbols is called semantics.

Unfortunately, just knowing the BPMN symbols is not enough for you to create useful process models. Since 2007, we have used BPMN extensively and often, and you can believe that we have suffered terribly! Mainly, we suffered because we always aimed for models with correct syntax and consistent semantics - in other words, unambiguous models. Others took the easy way out by saying: *"Our process model is not really syntactically correct, and it’s not really unambiguous. But that doesn’t matter because the main thing is that the consumer understands it!"* 

This attitude backfires because:
- When you apply BPMN in a syntactically incorrect way, you lose all benefits of standardization. After all, what do you need a standard for if the models all look different in the end? Many BPMN tools won’t even enable syntactically incorrect modeling.
- Semantic inaccuracies or inconsistencies always create the risk that your model will be misinterpreted. This risk is particularly high if you create an inconsistent target state process model and then send it to IT to implement.

If you want to supply your process model directly to the workflow engine, you must make your model correct, precise, and consistent. At that point, you still have to reconcile two contradictory objectives:

1. Different consumers must understand and accept the process model. Making the model easy to comprehend helps to reach agreement.
2. Because the process model has to meet the requirements of formal modeling, there’s usually an unavoidable level of complexity to it. This makes it harder to achieve the comprehension that leads to agreement.

Failure to reconcile the objectives, to bridge the gap in understanding between business and technology, is the main reason that process models have had limited success in the past. The really bad news is that BPMN alone also will not succeed!

Just as with spoken language, you can use BPMN and either succeed or fail. As with spoken language, successful use of BPMN depends on whom you want to communicate with and about what. You speak to your colleagues about the work you all know so well differently than you speak to your three-year-old about why the cat doesn’t like to be pulled by its tail. Similarly, you will need other BPMN process models for coordinating with your co-workers than for presenting the future process to upper management. Decide for yourself if the latter scenario is akin to the toddler-and-cat situation.

On the one hand, different BPMN process models are required for specific audiences and topics so that they can be understood. On the other hand, each model must contain all the detail necessary for the topic. BPMN may be a common language for business and IT, but the phrasing will remain different nevertheless.

The following understanding is therefore imperative for your work with BPMN:

**The precision and formal correctness of the process model must vary depending on the modeling objective and the expected consumers.** 

#### The customers of a process model

Whenever we model processes, we have to work in a customer-focused way. We must always keep the consumer of our model in mind. We must put ourselves in his or her place. This sounds simple, but few process models actually support this orientation.

As we have been saying, the knowledge, skills, and interests of the people who view our process models vary a great deal. In the following list, we have compiled the types we encounter in our BPM projects. These descriptions are for the roles played in relation to the project; they are not the titles of people in any organization. What we find is that the more experience an enterprise develops with BPM, the more consistently we see these roles fulfilled. 

**We recommend that you become familiar with:**

- **Process owner:** Process owners have strategic responsibilities for their processes. They are vitally interested in optimizing performance. They often have budget authority, but before they sign off, they need to be convinced that your improvement plan will work. In most companies, process owners inhabit the first or second tier of management. They may be members of management committees or heads of major divisions.
- **Process manager:** Process managers have operational responsibility for their processes. They report directly or indirectly to the process owners. They apply for improvement projects, acting as the ordering party for external services. Process managers are often low or middle-level managers.
- **Process participant:** Process participants work with the processes and actually create value. Their relationship to the process manager varies greatly. In companies organized by functional divisions - sales, logistics, and so on - a process manager is a functional executive for the division in which the process is carried out. Process participants report directly to that functional executive. If the process is carried out across departments, which is common, especially in process matrix organizations (see figure 1.7) conflicts can arise between department executives. Process modeling alone cannot resolve such issues, which is why we do not examine them further in this book.
- **Process analyst:** The core competencies of process analysts are BPM in general and BPMN in particular. They support process managers as internal or external service providers through all stages of the BPM life cycle. A process analyst may be the contact for external service providers or may act as the process manager’s representative. Within the company, process analysts usually have either their own sphere of competence in BPM, such as the business organization, or they are part of their IT divisions. It is rare, however, for a process analyst to be responsible for technical implementation.

  The analyst may like technical work, may know BPMN from back to front, but his or her strengths are as an organizer and communicator. As the builder of bridges between busi- ness and IT, the process analyst is the center of every BPM project. About 70 percent of the people who claim or are assigned to this role, in our experience, are poorly qualified because they lack the proper analytic predisposition. The most important qualification of a process analyst is not a facility for sending out information, but a facility for receiv- ing it. Good process analysts naturally want to understand everything thoroughly. At the same time, they have plenty of empathy in relating to the other people involved, and they can tailor their communication for every group. They remember every detail, but they also sensibly shield details from those for whom the details would just be a distraction.

  Do project managers make good process analysts? No, nor should the project manager be the same person as the process analyst. Most project managers see themselves as "dynamic, action-oriented individuals" who constantly have to "get someone on board" or "pull chestnuts out of the fire." They may be extremely skilled at delegating respon- sibility although, to be honest, some are clueless windbags. It may seem ideal to have a good process analyst also manage a BPM project, but it rarely works.
- **Process engineer:** Process engineers use technology to implement the target state process modeled by process analysts. In the best cases, they do so in the workflow engine, which automates the process. You can call a programmer who programs the process logic in Java, C#, or another language a process engineer. The programmer’s major work takes place during the implementation stage of the BPM life cycle, though the process analyst may get the process engineer involved at other stages as well.

Now that we’ve outlined the potential customers of a process model, we can talk about what the models should look like to keep these customers happy.
