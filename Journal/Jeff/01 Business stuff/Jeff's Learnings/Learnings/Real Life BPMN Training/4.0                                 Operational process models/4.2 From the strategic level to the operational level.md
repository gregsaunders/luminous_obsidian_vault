We often create a strategic model of the process before we model it at the operational level. For our recruiting process example, we created the strategic process model in section 3.2 on page 101. We depicted it in figure 4.3 on the next page, and in section 3.4 on page 112, we discussed the process’ weak points. We learned that the process sequence itself is not that bad; most of the friction comes from insufficient technological support. Now the process modeling needs to extend to the operational level. First, we’ll examine the sequence solely from an organizational standpoint. Second, we’ll think through what a workflow engine can contribute to improving the process.

Chapter 3 described how strategic process models often contain semantic contradictions. These make it impossible to refine the model directly, but strategic views often differ significantly from operational views. You can assume that a strategic process model rarely changes. At the operational level, you can expect changes more often. That’s another reason for the principal structure of models at this level to be technically compatible with the even more detailed implementation models to follow.

As a consequence, while we will reference the strategic process model often, we have to develop the operational model afresh. That may sound like a problem, but in practice it usually is not: The strategic model doesn’t take that much time to create, and it achieves clarity about strategic purposes and outcomes that you shouldn’t need to revisit while developing at the operational model. Also, because the strategic level changes so infrequently, you need not worry about duplicating effort to maintain it through updates.

The recruiting process example has a semantic difficulty at the strategic level: the different cardinality of instances. It looks as though every applicant for a job gets that job, even though everyone understands that’s not the real-world expectation. Everyone assumes that the normal course of events is that several applicants submit applications, that Human Resources checks a corresponding number of applications, and that a single applicant ultimately fills the vacancy. Another difficulty is that we don’t know our applicants nor their number. These are two reasons that, when it comes to creating an operational model, we cannot represent the applicant as a lane in the same pool as the other participants.

A valid operational model also has to specify the interaction between the hiring department and Human Resources more realistically. It’s not as if HR carries out the job advertisement and application checking tasks without consulting the hiring department. The process analysis (section 3.4 on page 112) showed that the two departments communicate actively; it is the ineffectiveness of their communication that causes most of the friction and ambiguity. What makes the most sense therefore is to model the processes of these participants in separate pools. That allows an explicit examination of the organizational interfaces. It also allows us to provide each participant with information relevant to his or her role, and we can exclude irrelevant information. Irrelevant information is a huge over-complication!

Figure 4.4 on the following page shows the recruiting process after moving the lanes into separate pools and accounting for the activities that require exchanges between participants. The applicant still reacts to the signal of a job being advertised, but the three short lines at the bottom center of the applicant pool indicate that there potentially are multiple applicants. (Refer to section 2.9.5 on page 84.) The possibility of multiple applicants is why we modeled an AND split after the message application received event; it shows that HR is not waiting for a single application but will instead process any applications received. The terminate event at the end of the HR pool means that this activity will continue only until an applicant is selected and successfully employed.

Open issues remain to be settled and modeled. Not only do we have to define the to be *clarified* activities, but we have possible special cases to account for. What if:

- an applicant is rejected as unqualified?
- not even one applicant is qualified?
- not even one application is received?

Examining this entire process at the operational level easily could exceed this book’s goal of illustrating principles and methods. In the following sections, therefore, we elaborate only on the part starting with identifying the personnel requirement through advertising the job.
