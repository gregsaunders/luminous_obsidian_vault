### Purpose and benefit

It is at the operational level that process models begin to reveal operational details in the form of human and technical flows. Process participants reference operational process models (the human flows, that is) every day. Process analysts examine them to identify improvements. Also, operational process diagrams can be the starting point for technical process implementation in the form of technical flows —ideally by a workflow engine. The operational process model obviously describes more detail than does the strategic model, but this leads to a problem:

A whole process is a complex interaction between people and IT systems as they carry out tasks. The process analyst is concerned with getting to the heart of these interactions so that he or she can devise organizational or technical improvements. **The *analyst’s* question is:**

How is the work done, and how can we do it better?

The ***process participant*** only cares about the aspects of the process that concern him directly. He wants to know:

How should I do my work?

When a process requires technology to be implemented, the ***process engineer*** gets involved. He or she has to understand what the technical implementation is meant to achieve from a functional point of view. The process engineer asks him- or herself:

What does the engine have to achieve?

It isn’t easy to reconcile the three roles, and answering their questions is the challenge of the operational level. If you meet the challenge successfully, the benefits are:

- The logic of the operational process model is consistent between operations and the technical implementation. In other words, the process actually works as documented.
- The understanding gap between business and IT shrinks. The parties can discuss the same process model, and they can recognize both the technical effects of business requirements and the impact technical implementations may have on operations.
- If the process is implemented by a workflow engine, monitoring and reporting on the process can become much more substantial and immediate.

In short, **if you master the operational level, you will have found the common language of business and IT** - at least as far as process modeling is concerned.
    

### Model requirements

Just as with the strategic level, operational process diagrams must be syntactically correct. Although some semantic irregularities can be tolerated at the strategic level, we can’t allow them in operational models. The operational level describes how work is actually done, so there can be neither contradictions in content nor formal mistakes.

As you develop the operational model for any project that includes technical implementation by means of a workflow engine, another requirement arises: All the questions that the process engineer must ask to understand the desired outcomes need to be answered. After all, the technical model itself becomes executable.

Precision serves the process participants too, because they should be able to refer to the model for how to accomplish the work. At the same time, it is best not to burden participants with complexity that doesn’t serve them. After all, the participants’ core competence is the work itself, not BPM. For participants, the process model is just a means to an end, something they may reference only once in a while.

### Procedure

An operational process model has to be sufficiently precise but not overly complicated. To achieve that apparently contradictory goal, we provide a view of the process model specific to each role. Figure 4.2 on the facing page depicts what we mean. If the process participants see a view that represents only their perspective, they are satisfied. The participants know what to do and when to wait for others to complete their portions of the process without being distracted by the details of what the others do.

The core idea of the operational level is to differentiate consistently between orchestration and collaboration. As explained in section 2.9 on page 78, each participant gets his or her own pool. This presents the participant’s experience as its own, closed process. Reserve the diagram that shows the collaboration among these processes for the process analyst, who presumably can handle the complexity.

Treat the workflow engine as a participant with its own pool, and the process engineer can focus on it. Note that in this approach we are following the BPMN idea of a conductor for each pool who controls its processes. BPMN presumes a workflow engine even when a human serves in place of an actual workflow engine.

Aside from the improved views, this differentiation is important because in practice, the entire process is almost never controlled completely by a workflow engine. There are always decisions to be made and tasks to be carried out by humans. To represent the process completely in a model, we have to account for the human activities. We accomplish this when we assign a separate pool to each participant, whether human or not.

The process analyst plays a major role in achieving a differentiated model. He or she must comprehend BPMN fully and be able to model the process from different participants’ points of view. If the target state process is to be implemented in a workflow engine, he or she must develop and maintain the model in all its representations, from the strategic to the technical.

This is an example of the process analyst’s steps:

1. Review the target state process at the strategic level.(See chapter 3.)
2. Resolve the lanes in to separate pools.(See section 4.2 on the following page.)
3. Model the human flows, that is, the target-state process from each participant’s point of view.(The participants and the process manager must settle upon these details. See section 4.3 on page 122.)
4. Model what the participants do that will be supported by the work flow engine and how it will do so. This also must be settled between the manager and participants. (See section 4.4 on page 125.)
5. Model the technical flows, at least to the extent that these can be derived from the participants’ processes. The process analyst or the process engineer can do this. The operational model won’t be directly executable, but the process engineer can enhance the model for that purpose. (See section 4.4.2 on page 127.)
6. Finalize and document other requirements such as templates, data, and business rules. Group these around the process model by referencing them from their relevant symbols in the diagram (See section 4.4.3 on page 129.)

This is only one approach. If it makes sense to you, you can start from the technical flow and work bottom up, or you can work outward from an operational process model. Frequently, it is the operational process model that comes into existence first because the business and IT got together during a workshop, and they developed the human and technical flows concurrently.

After developing the model, show the views to the people affected. This takes a tool with good presentation functions. The ability to expand and collapse pools is especially valuable, since the expand/collapse function means you can avoid having a lot of different diagrams with redundantly modeled pools. For more on tool support for BPMN in general and our framework in particular, see section 7.4.2 on page 204.
