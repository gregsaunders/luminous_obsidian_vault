Many people interested in BPMN already know other process modeling notations. They wonder if switching is worthwhile and what they have to watch out for. In this section, we compare four other notation systems - the ones we encounter most often in our practice - with BPMN. The primary weakness in all of them, which leads us to prefer BPMN, is that they lack the ability to model the interactions of participants acting autonomously. As we saw earlier, simple swimlane representations are insufficient for modeling collaboration. A secondary reason to prefer BPMN is the greater precision it provides, compared to the other notation systems, for handling events.

### Extended event-driven process chain (eEPC)

The event-driven process chain (EPC) is a component of the ARIS methodology developed at Saarland University in cooperation with SAP AG. The resulting BPM software, ARIS Toolset, integrated tightly with the ERP (enterprise resource planning) solutions by SAP. Processes implemented in SAP products consequently were documented as EPCs, and that’s a major reason they’ve been implemented so widely. It also made EPC dominant as a notation until 2008. Now, however, it has become apparent that EPC will be superseded by BPMN. Many EPC process modelers are preparing to switch, although that’s not always easy because of differences in the approach. Meanwhile, ARIS offers process modeling with BPMN as well.

The EPC consists of the three basic symbols: function, event, and connector. Similar to gateways in BPMN, connectors can function as exclusive branches (XOR), and/or branches (OR), or in parallel (AND). The difference between data and event-based branches does not exist in EPC. The extended version added symbols to describe organizational units, data, and application systems. You can reference subprocesses through so-called process paths or process signposts.

Converting EPC process models into BPMN is comparatively simple, as shown in figure 2.109 on the next page, though you need to be careful when converting events. EPC interprets possible data states the same way as it interprets events —incoming messages that trigger a process, for example. You mustn’t model data-based decisions as event- based gateways, but rather as data-based gateways. Given EPC’s name, it is ironic that BPMN is superior for modeling events. EPC neither differentiates between start, end, or intermediate events nor does it recognize different types such as message or timer. EPC doesn’t let you attach events, so it is difficult or impossible to model monitoring functions, troubleshooting, or escalations. Another advantage of BPMN is in how it lets you treat an application as a data object: we could have attached our application as an input to the check application task (as in EPC), but instead, we attached it to the sequence flow between the start event and the task. You can thus see at a glance that the document was not already available in the company, but that it was sent there.

EPC still has lots of users. They have a history with EPC, they are used to working with it, and they may find it hard to internalize the new paradigm that BPMN represents. Given the shortcomings of EPC for modeling process automation, however, you should not consider it for modern BPM projects.

### UML activity diagram

The activity diagram is one of 13 diagram types defined in UML (Unified Modeling Language) version 2. Like BPMN, UML is managed by the OMG (Object Management Group), though only since 1997. No one should mistake BPMN as a successor to UML, because UML is a general language for modeling software systems. Though it was not developed for modeling business processes, UML activity diagrams have been used often for process modeling - especially for IT projects. One frequent use has been to diagram target state processes as part of developing engineering requirements for new software.

UML’s notation for activity diagrams is more comprehensive than EPC’s. It contains a couple of symbols specific to software that have no direct equivalent in BPMN, including processing objects and object parameters in individual actions. Most of the current UML symbols for modeling business processes can be converted with no problem. What does become difficult is if you work with interruptible activity regions that cross several lanes. It would be a tidy solution to transfer these into BPMN as embedded subprocesses, but we can’t do that because subprocesses in BPMN must not cross lane boundaries. The only solution is to define the subprocesses as global (and thus reusable), and to model the pool and lanes. That may be ugly, but it is the only way to make it work. (See figure 2.110 on the following page.)

Activity diagrams remain important for specifying software-related detailed sequences. Their integration in the UML framework supports this, as does the standardization by the OMG. But we think BPMN is still better for requirements engineering of process-driven applications, particularly if you also need to document process functions. Defining processes that the workflow engine executes directly is BPMN’s specialty. No other notation can match it.

### ibo sequence plan

The ibo sequence plan is implemented in Prometheus, which is BPM software from ibo Software. Like EPC, Prometheus is a proprietary notation system. We include it here because it is based on the conventional and widespread flow diagram. (ibo is a management consulting agency with more than 25 years of experience. Most of its customers are from the German-speaking financial world.) Though the ibo sequence plan is well established among process managers, ibo has discovered the advantages of BPMN. It has integrated BPMN into Prometheus.

Most of the symbols of the sequence plan transfer easily into BPMN, as we illustrate in figure 2.111 on page 93. The only problem is when you have a temporal interruption in your sequence plan. This can only be modeled as a timer event if it is caused by a process owner who deliberately does nothing for a certain period, and who then continues the process. We already examined sequences in which an interruption served as an indicator. We could continue the process after a countdown expired and because something else needed to happen. That does not work in BPMN. The only solution is to model the event that we’re waiting on as a type (a message or a condition, perhaps), and to append an annotation to show how long it usually takes for the event to occur. That gives us a clean control flow without losing the indicator for the average wait time.

### Key figures and probabilities

Can BPMN analyze and simulate processes? People who have worked with other notation systems ask this regularly, but the answer may not be a matter of methods but one of tools. What BPM software do you use? Does it let you store key figures and probabilities as well as the corresponding analysis?

To be honest, the BPMN specification - even at version 2.0 - does not provide attributes to integrate key figures in process analysis. You could regard that as a regrettable deficit in the standard. On the other hand, simulation is particularly complex, and few people or organizations are willing to spend the time and money to implement it consistently. If the BPMN specification represented all aspects of process simulation, the document would probably be 50 to 100 pages longer than it is. The shift in focus might even undermine BPMN in terms of the things it does well.

Figure 2.112 on the following page shows how the key figures lead time (LT), idle time (IT), and cycle time (CT) can be visualized in a process diagram along with probable outcomes. After an application arrives, it sits for about two hours before it is checked. The check takes 15 minutes, then the expert decides whether to reject or record it. Nine times out of ten, the application is recorded. We have modeled possible intermediate states, and we can offer the first analysis: The processing time from receipt to recording is 160 minutes. Rejects take only 140 minutes because the process bypasses the holding time on the clerk’s desk. Taking all probabilities into consideration, we know that the average running time for the process is 158 minutes. Appropriately, we note this at the end event.

This is merely one example. Different BPMN tools offer different ways to define key figures, and they provide a variety of ways to depict and to use them. The extent to which process simulation is carried out makes further demands on the process model. Further dependencies may include the occurrence probability of multiple, the capacity of resources, and so on.
