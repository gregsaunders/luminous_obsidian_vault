### The conductor and the orchestra

In section 2.5 on page 40, we described using lanes to assign responsibility for tasks or subprocesses to different task workers. Lanes always exist in a pool, and the pool boundaries represent process boundaries from start to end. To BPMN, the pool represents a higher-ranking instance compared to its lanes. The pool assumes process control - in other words, it assigns the tasks. It behaves like the conductor of an orchestra, and so this type of process is called orchestration.

In figure 2.92, the conductor arranges for Falko to process task 2 as soon as Robert completes task 1. The conductor has the highest-level control of the process, and each instrument in the orchestra plays the tune the conductor decides upon.

Do you think this is unrealistic? Many experienced process modelers have problems with this way of thinking. They would prefer to model a process sequence like that shown in figure 2.93 on the facing page on the assumption that no almighty conductor exists in their company, and that individual task workers have to coordinate and cooperate on their own.

![[Journal/Jeff/01 Business stuff/Jeff's Learnings/Learnings/Real Life BPMN Training/attachments/Pasted image 20240508130616.png]]

To coordinate cooperation with BPMN requires explicit modeling. You assign each task worker a separate pool, and the process passes from one to the next as a message flow (as shown in figure 2.94). In principle, this creates four independent conductors. These have control over their respective mini-processes, but they can’t do anything other than to send messages that trigger their successor processes.

That seems complicated - and you don’t have to choose the coordinated cooperation method for practical modeling. It reveals a basic principle, however, that you must under- stand. Even though BPMN lanes look very much like those of other process notations, they represent an entirely different way of thinking, which we attribute to BPMN’s origin in the world of process automation. In that world, the workflow engine controls all tasks in the process, even though different task workers may execute them. So the workflow engine equates to the mysterious, almighty process conductor.

Have you heard of service orchestration in connection with Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)? That’s almost exactly the task of a workflow engine, except that these services are not only fully automated web services; they also can be tasks executed by human process participants as directed by the workflow engine. What does that signify, however, for purely functional process modeling, in which you also describe processes not controlled by such a workflow engine? There’s no general answer to that question.

You can eliminate pools and work just with lanes, modeling the message exchange as normal tasks as shown in figure 2.93 on the preceding page. That’s traditional, and it’s a pragmatic solution during, say, a transitional period that allows your co-workers to adapt. In the medium and long terms, however, avoiding pools denies you a powerful device for increasing the significance of process models.

The next chapter explains the most important rules to be observed when working with pools and message flows. Meanwhile, we show the usefulness of this new thinking by example. One thing to remember is that if you strive to harmonize your functional and executable process models to achieve a better alignment of business and IT, you inevitably face this type of process modeling whether you use BPMN or not.

### Rules for application

When working with pools and message flows, you may model the following things (see figure 2.95):
- Catching message events, which message flows enter
- Throwing message flows, which message flows exit
- Tasks, which message flows enter or exit
- (Expanded) subprocesses, which message flows enter or exit

![[Journal/Jeff/01 Business stuff/Jeff's Learnings/Learnings/Real Life BPMN Training/attachments/Pasted image 20240508131108.png]]

The following constructs violate the BPMN specification and therefore must not be applied
(see figure 2.96):
- Sequence flows exceeding pool boundaries
- Message flows not exceeding pool boundaries
- Events with message flows that are not of the message type
- Events, which message flows enter and exit
- Message flows with arrows at the beginnings and the ends
- Gateways with message flows

### The art of collaboration

We examined the process represented in figure 2.97 in connection with the event-based gateway.

Now consider the broader picture, and think about how this process happens from the point of view of the pizza delivery service. Presumably, it looks like figure 2.98: As soon as we receive an order, we bake the pizza. Our delivery person takes it to the customer and collects the money, whereby the process completes successfully.

![[Journal/Jeff/01 Business stuff/Jeff's Learnings/Learnings/Real Life BPMN Training/attachments/Pasted image 20240508131501.png]]

We want to link the two processes, that is, to examine the interaction of customer and delivery service from a neutral perspective. We can try to model this interaction by means of a pool and lanes as in figure 2.99, but it doesn’t work well: There are tasks and events that reference interaction within the pool - waiting for the delivery, for instance, or collecting the money. Other tasks are carried out by roles oblivious to their partners, such as baking the pizza and eating the pizza. It is impossible to differentiate the two visually. Strictly speaking, the diagram is not semantically correct because message events always refer to messages received by the process from outside, and that’s not the case here.

If we go with pools, the whole process looks like figure 2.100. Both processes in the combined representation would look just as they did before, but now they connect through message flows. BPMN calls this form of visualization a collaboration diagram. It shows two independent processes collaborating.

![[Journal/Jeff/01 Business stuff/Jeff's Learnings/Learnings/Real Life BPMN Training/attachments/Pasted image 20240508131756.png]]

In two cases, the message flows do not end in an activity or event, but at the participants’ respective pool boundaries. The first one comes from the inquire at delivery service task; the second one connects to the collect money task. The rationale behind the first one is that our inquiry does not influence the sequence flow of the deliverer. The pizza service may provide information or speed up its order processing in anticipation of a new order, but the baking, delivering, and collecting of money doesn’t change just because an inquiry came in. As for the collect money messages, there’s a flaw in the model of the customer process: we have to pay for the pizza before we eat it, and that task is still missing. We added it to figure 2.101, and now we can connect the message flows directly to the pay for pizza task.

### Collapse pools

It often happens that we don’t know the processes of all parties in detail. We may know the processes of our own company, for example, but not those of a partner company. As long as our partner and we adhere to agreed-upon interfaces, such as receiving or sending certain messages, things can still operate smoothly. As customers of the pizza delivery service, we expect the deliverer to:

- Accept pizza orders,
- Deliver ordered pizzas and collect the money, and
- Be available for inquiries.

As customers, we have little interest in the deliverer’s internal process. Maybe he bakes and then delivers the pizza; maybe when he’s out of supplies, he gets another pizza service to bake the pizza and deliver it. That’s his problem - we simply expect to receive our pizza. In modeling such cases, we can hide the deliverer’s process and collapse the pool (see figure 2.102 on the following page).

![[Journal/Jeff/01 Business stuff/Jeff's Learnings/Learnings/Real Life BPMN Training/attachments/Pasted image 20240508132247.png]]

We could go a step further and collapse the customer’s pool too (see figure 2.103 on the next page). Now we see only the messages to be exchanged, assuming that we label the arrows to give us the general idea. The downside is that we can’t recognize interdependencies any more. We can’t see if the inquiry always goes out, or only takes place under certain conditions -the actual case. BPMN fixed this problem in version 2.0 by introducing a new type of diagram, the so-called choreography diagram that we describe in section 2.13 on page 94.

### Multiple instance pools

We showed in section 2.7.2 on page 63 and section 2.8.4 on page 73 that tasks or subprocesses can be marked as multiple, which means that these elements instantiate several times during execution. BPMN applies this principle to pools too.

Because a pool always represents a participant, we name the construct multiple participants. Figure 2.104 on the next page shows how to apply it. We defined three participants: customer, agent, and supplier. If the agent’s process is instantiated, it does so because a customer places an order. This causes the agent to execute the invite offer task repeatedly. The supplier pool now has the same marker as the task that executed repeatedly. At a glance, this shows that it is not always the same supplier, but that several suppliers are involved. After obtaining all the offers, one is selected and forwarded to the customer.

The multiple instance participant always helps us when we want to show the interaction of processes in collaboration diagrams. Some processes may instantiate only once while others instantiate several times within the scope of cooperation.
