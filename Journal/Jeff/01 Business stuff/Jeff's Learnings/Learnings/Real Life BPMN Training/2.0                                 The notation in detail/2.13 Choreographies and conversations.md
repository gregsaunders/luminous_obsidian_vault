We showed in section 2.9 on page 78 that BPMN attaches particular importance to the interaction of different participants. BPMN even describes two additional modeling methods for this. We have so far seen little value in these methods for real-life projects, but weâ€™ll explain their potential. At the bottom right of figure 2.113 on the facing page is our pizza collaboration from section 2.9 on page 78. It was merely decorated with the message objects (the envelopes), and we have positioned them on the message flows.

In the middle of the picture, notice the corresponding choreography diagram. This diagram reduces our view of the process to the exchange of messages between participants. In section 2.9.4 on page 83, the pools of both participants were collapsed. Choreography diagrams are considerably more accurate because we can still recognize the fundamental sequence. In the earlier diagram, it appeared that the customer only asked for delivery if 60 minutes elapsed since his or her order. That would be strange. In contrast, a choreography diagram models only the tasks that are relevant to the message exchange, and they do it only once for both participants. This makes the diagram much clearer. The sending participant has a white background; the receiving or reacting participant has a grey background. It does not matter if you place the participants above or below the task. Choreography diagrams can also define subprocesses to be modeled as choreographies.

The top part of the figure models the content of a matching conversation. This is the most compact way to represent the participants and their collaboration. A conversation in this regard stands for messages that are exchanged and logically connected to each other. In other words, they correlate. In most cases, a conversation should stand for one collaborative process only. To be precise, we note that conversations in BPMN are not a separate type of diagram, but a variant of a collaboration diagram.

When do such diagrams make sense? Some BPMN experts regard them as superfluous, but we disagree. A one-person business may have little need for process modeling, but the systematic examination of processes - from an organizational or a technological perspective - only becomes more important as an organization grows larger and more heterogeneous.

As the number of people collaborating in a process increases, the less you can depend on implicit understandings and coordination among them, and the more important process modeling becomes. The same applies even more clearly to process implementation beyond the limits of IT systems. Both choreography diagrams and conversations can represent useful maps for situations where you have to recognize quickly the critical points in a collaboration. If required, you can then model them in more detailed collaboration diagrams.
