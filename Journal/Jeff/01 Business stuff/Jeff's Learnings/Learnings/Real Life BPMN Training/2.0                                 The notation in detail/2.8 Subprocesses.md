#### Encapsulate complexity

The examples in this book either deal with simple processes, or they diagram complex processes superficially so that the models fit on one page. When modeling your process landscape, you don’t have this luxury. You have to rough out your processes so that you can get the general ideas in place and recognize correlations. Then you have to develop a detailed description, so that you can analyze exactly where the weak points are or how you’ll have to execute the process in practice. The possible top-down refinements or bottom-up aggregations mark the difference between true process models and banal flow charts, between sophisticated BPM software products and mere drawing programs.

BPMN provides us with the subprocess to help with the expanding/collapsing view. A subprocess describes a detailed sequence, but it takes no more space in the diagram of the parent process than does a task. Both tasks and subprocesses are part of the activities class and are therefore represented as rectangles with rounded corners. The only difference is the plus sign, indicating a stored detailed sequence for the subprocess. (See figure 2.77 on the next page.)

What good is that to us? That depends most on how your BPMN tool supports the following options for connecting subprocesses with their parent processes:
- **Representation in a separate process diagram:** The subprocess symbol links to a separate diagram. If your BPMN tool displays the process model in a web browser, for instance, clicking on the symbol would open a new page to display the detail diagram. (See figure 2.78 on the facing page.)
- **Expanding in the process diagram of the parent process:** The activity with the plus sign is called a collapsed subprocess. The plus sign suggests that you could click on it and make the subprocess expand. The BPMN specification provides for this option, though not all tool suppliers implement it. Figure 2.79 on the next page shows how the subprocess was directly expanded in the diagram of the parent process. A tool supporting this function enables you to expand and collapse the subprocess directly in the diagram, respectively, to show or hide details.

Direct expansion may seem appealing, but often it is not useful in practice. Expanding the subprocess requires that all the adjacent symbols in the diagram shift to make room. This can result in sluggish performance with a complex diagram, and it can be visually . . . nasty. The most important thing is that your tool provides for linking and that you can usefully navigate through the diagrams. In other words, it supports the first option above. Yes, it can be helpful to have your subprocess modeled and expandable directly from the parent process. That means process segments remain localized, and you can attach events too (see section 2.8.3 on page 71). This is, however, the less important option.

The sequence flow of the parent process ends in both cases at the left edge of the subprocess. The next sequence flow starts at the right edge. This means that sequence flows are not allowed to exceed the boundaries of the subprocess, which not every beginner knows, and which becomes a problem when a subprocess expands.

Visualize a token that behaves as follows:
- The parent process starts, and a token is born.
- The token runs through the task and arrives at the subprocess, which causes the parent process to create an instance of the subprocess.
- Within the subprocess, a separate token is born which runs through the subprocess from the start to the end event, but the token of the parent process waits until the subprocess completes.
- When the subprocess token arrives at the end event, it is consumed, which completes the subprocess. Now the token of the parent process moves to its own end event.

The encapsulation in subprocesses that we’re describing isn’t restricted to two levels. You could just as easily have a parent process as a subprocess, or you could model further subprocesses on the level of a defined subprocess. How many levels you use and the level of detail you apply to model them is up to you. BPMN doesn’t specify this, and there can be no cross-company or cross-scenario cookbook to define levels. Participants in our BPMN workshops don’t like this, but there’s no point in hiding the fact nor attempting to explain it away. In the following chapters, we work often with subprocesses in explaining our best practices, but the truth is the number of refinement levels and their respective levels of detail is always situational. It depends on the organization, the roles of the project participants, and the goals for the process you’re modeling.

You may remember that we explained in section 2.2 on page 27 that you can work without start and end events. Without them, you can make the parallelization shown in the top part of figure 2.80 on the facing page somewhat more compact. In this example, start and end events were used in the parent process, but not in the expanded subprocess. That’s completely legitimate, but we don’t do this ourselves for two reasons:
1. It increases the risk of confusing inexperienced consumers of the model.
2. It is easy to confuse the representation with the ad hoc subprocess to be introduced later in the book. We use that a lot.

The example shows that subprocesses in BPMN practice are used not only to refine processes in terms of content; they are also a "technical stylistic device" for creating diagrams. The following sections illustrate this.

![[Journal/Jeff/01 Business stuff/Jeff's Learnings/Learnings/Real Life BPMN Training/attachments/Pasted image 20240508121253.png]]

#### Modularization and reuse

In version 1.2, BPMN differentiated between embedded and reusable subprocesses by assigning an attribute to a subprocess. In version 2.0, BPMN maintains this differentiation in principle, but it is defined differently. A subprocess now is embedded intrinsically, and it can be reused only by defining it as a global subprocess, and then referencing it by means of a call activity. We therefore refer to embedded subprocesses and global subprocesses in the following.

An embedded subprocess can occur only within a parent process to which it belongs. An embedded subprocess cannot contain pools and lanes, but it can be placed within the pool or the lane of the parent process. Furthermore, an embedded subprocess may have only a none start event; start events such as messages or timers are not permitted. An embedded subprocess has essentially nothing more than a kind of delimited scope within the parent process, which may serve two goals:

1. To encapsulate complexity (as already described)
2. To formulate a "collective statement" on a part of the parent process by attaching events or placing markers. We deal with this option later.

On the other hand, global subprocesses may occur in completely different parent processes. There are a great many subprocesses that, in practice, are used over and over. A good example is the procurement of an item because a customer ordered it or you need to re-stock supply. Another example is invoicing because you’ve delivered or repaired an item as shown in figure 2.81. In the example, notice that call activities differ from regular activities by their considerably thicker borders.

![[Journal/Jeff/01 Business stuff/Jeff's Learnings/Learnings/Real Life BPMN Training/attachments/Pasted image 20240508122035.png]]

The connection a global subprocesses has to its parent is considerably less close, and they can have their own pools and lanes. You can think of the participant responsible for a subprocess as a service provider for various parent processes. It is a like a shared service center.

The loose connection also affects data transfer between the parent and the subprocess. BPMN assumes that embedded subprocesses can read all the data of the parent process directly, but an explicit assignment is required for global subprocesses to be able to read it. That may seem like merely a technical aspect at first, one that modelers and the consumers of their models care to know about but won’t wish to bother with. After some consideration, however, you may see the impact this difference makes on the organization. Consider this:

When your accounting department wants to issue an invoice for a repair, it always needs:
- A billing address
- The date of performance delivery
- A description of performance
- An amount to invoice
- An expected date of payment

The owners of order processing, not just the repair department, must provide this data. Accounting will want the data in a standard format, won’t it? This corresponds well to what BPMN calls required data mapping between parent processes and global subprocesses. (Do you notice how often these weird techie issues correspond to the organizational needs and expectations of a process?) BPMN simply forces us to formalize many matters that seem self-evident, or that remained unconscious or forgotten in the process design. Formalization is our best chance of keeping up in a fast-changing environment with ever more complex processes.

### Attached events

We already learned about intermediate events that can be attached to tasks. The same events can be attached to subprocesses as well, which opens up a wide range of opportunity in process modeling. As shown in figure 2.82, we can represent how a spontaneous dinner invitation leads to canceling our cooking process. In the process shown, however, we could ignore the invitation if our meal had already been prepared and we already ate it.

![[Journal/Jeff/01 Business stuff/Jeff's Learnings/Learnings/Real Life BPMN Training/attachments/Pasted image 20240508122507.png]]

Where message, timer, and conditional events are involved, the parent process always aborts the subprocess when reacting to external circumstances. With error, cancellation, and escalation events, however, the subprocess reports these events to the parent process. This isn’t as abstract as it may sound.

In the bottom right of figure 2.83 on the next page, the item procurement task can fail because the item is no longer available. Because item procurement is a global subprocess, it triggers an error event to tell the parent process that something went wrong. In business terms, this may mean that the customer who wanted to buy the item tells a salesperson that his or her order failed because the item is out of stock. A clerk then orders more of the item to replenish inventory.

![[Journal/Jeff/01 Business stuff/Jeff's Learnings/Learnings/Real Life BPMN Training/attachments/Pasted image 20240508122639.png]]

It is interesting that parent processes can handle the error message differently. While the disappointed customer must be informed within the scope of the order process, it is sufficient for the stock maintenance process to delete the item from the catalog. The respective parent processes decide what circumstances require canceling the subprocess and what happens next. That’s a principle that you can use to build flexible and modular process landscapes.

The signal event serves two functions. A parent process can react to a signal received from the outside while it executes a subprocess - this is much like a message event. But we also use the signal event to let the subprocess communicate things other than errors to the parent process. Primarily, this is because we can’t model this type of communication with message events. BPMN assumes that we always send messages to other participants who are outside of our pool boundaries; the communication between parent and subprocess doesn’t fit that mold. We don’t use signal events for directed communication, but rather to broadcast information akin to advertisements on the radio.

A better alternative is the escalation event (see figure 2.84).

![[Journal/Jeff/01 Business stuff/Jeff's Learnings/Learnings/Real Life BPMN Training/attachments/Pasted image 20240508123105.png]]

The subprocess can use an escalation event to report directly to the parent process, and the message won’t be regarded as an error message. Also, the parent process can receive and process messages from escalation events without canceling the subprocess because non-interrupting intermediate events can be attached .

### Markers

You can apply the loop, multiple instance, and compensation task markers that we described in section 2.7.2 on page 63 in a fashion similar to the way you apply subprocesses. You can use them to model even complex loops as shown in figure 2.85. The top and bottom parts of this diagram are equivalent.

![[Journal/Jeff/01 Business stuff/Jeff's Learnings/Learnings/Real Life BPMN Training/attachments/Pasted image 20240508124109.png]]

One marker available only for subprocesses is called ad hoc. Recognize it by the tilde character as shown in (figure 2.86 on the next page). Use the ad hoc subprocess to mark a segment in which the contained activities (tasks or subprocesses) can be:

- Executed in any order,
- Executed several times, or
- Skipped.

![[Journal/Jeff/01 Business stuff/Jeff's Learnings/Learnings/Real Life BPMN Training/attachments/Pasted image 20240508124314.png]]

Any party who executes this subprocess decides what to do and when to do it. You could say that the barely structured nature of what happens inside this subprocess reduces the whole idea of process modeling to an absurdity because what happens and when are the things we most want to control. On the other hand, this is the reality of many processes, and you can’t model them without representing their free-form character. Frequent examples are when a process relies largely on implicit knowledge or creativity, or when different employees carry out a process differently. You can use the ad hoc subprocess to flag what may be an undesirable actual state. Doing so could be a step on the path to a more standardized procedure.

BPMN specifies which symbols must, which may, and which are forbidden to occur within an ad hoc subprocess. They are:
- **Must:** Activities
- **May:** Data objects, sequence flows, associations, groups, message flows, gateways, and intermediate events
- **Forbidden:** Start and end events, symbols for conversations and choreographies (dis- cussed later)

By means of the specification, mixed forms - so-called weakly structured processes - can be modeled as shown in figure 2.87.

![[Journal/Jeff/01 Business stuff/Jeff's Learnings/Learnings/Real Life BPMN Training/attachments/Pasted image 20240508124737.png]]

### Transactions

Many processes work in an all-or-nothing fashion: either all steps must be carried out successfully or nothing must be done at all. The compensation event, which we discussed in section 2.6.9 on page 54, can undo tasks already completed without having to model the undoing in detail. The transaction is a special subprocess, which also helps us in such cases. We explain this in figure 2.88 using the following example:

Suppose you want to visit relatives overseas. After deciding to make the trip, you start preparing for it. First, you make a firm plan with your relatives regarding the date and length of your visit. Second, you book a discount flight, and you reserve a hotel room (to avoid being an excessive burden on your hosts, despite their protests to the contrary). Third, you schedule vacation time with your boss. If all goes well, you can start the trip.

What happens, however, if the hotel you wanted is booked and you can’t find another? What if the boss denies your vacation request? You have to cancel the travel preparation transaction. The cancel event exists for this purpose. You can only use it within transactions. If you cancel a transaction, it triggers a compensation of all tasks to which corresponding compensation tasks were assigned. You therefore sadly inform your hosts that you won’t be able to come at the agreed date, and you cancel the hotel reservation, if any. Because you booked a discount flight, the airline will not refund the ticket price. (You curse them silently.) After compensating for all the tasks already executed, you leave the transaction through the attached cancel event, and you start over with preparations for a different travel plan.

![[Journal/Jeff/01 Business stuff/Jeff's Learnings/Learnings/Real Life BPMN Training/attachments/Pasted image 20240508125102.png]]

This process is flawed. Because of the cursed airline’s poor refund policy, it would make more sense to book the flight only after the other details are confirmed. Book it at the end of, or outside of, the transaction to minimize risk. That’s the point: transactions are for critical processes in which even the smallest risk has to be taken into account. If you arrange your vacation time with the boss in advance, the risk of having your request rejected seems small, but it hasn’t been reduced to zero, has it? An important bit of work may come in, and your non-binding agreement with the boss may evaporate. Transactions provide security for scenarios like this.

### Event subprocesses

We locate an event subprocess within another process or subprocess. Recognize them by their dotted-line frames.

A single start event triggers an event subprocess, and this can only happen while the enclosing process or subprocess remains active. For event subprocesses, there can be interrupting (continuous line) and non-interrupting (dashed line) events. This is the same differentiation made as for attached intermediate events. Depending on the type of start event, the event subprocess will cancel the enclosing subprocess, or it will execute simultaneously. You can trigger non-interrupting event subprocesses as often as you wish, as long as the enclosing subprocess remains active.

Okay, that’s pretty abstract, but we can demonstrate how an event subprocess works with an example. (See figure 2.89.)

We invited a couple of friends for dinner. This starts the dinner preparation subprocess of choosing a recipe and then preparing the meal. While we are doing that, the telephone rings. Another guest invites himself to dinner. Spontaneous as we are, we just increase the amount of food or set another place at the table without interrupting the meal preparation. If an accident happens during preparation, however, the error immediately triggers the interrupting event subprocess for remedial action. We order food for delivery. When this event subprocess completes, we exit the enclosing subprocess through the regular exit and attend to eating the meal.

![[Journal/Jeff/01 Business stuff/Jeff's Learnings/Learnings/Real Life BPMN Training/attachments/Pasted image 20240508125630.png]]

You can see in figure 2.90 on the facing page how event subprocesses are represented in collapsed state: The frame is a dotted line, and we have again used the plus sign to represent collapsed subprocesses. In the top left corner, we also have the start event triggering the subprocess.

![[Journal/Jeff/01 Business stuff/Jeff's Learnings/Learnings/Real Life BPMN Training/attachments/Pasted image 20240508125736.png]]

The event types that can trigger non-interrupting event subprocesses are:
- Message
- Timer
- Escalation
- Conditional
- Signal
- Multiple
- Multiple parallel  

There are two more types for the interrupting event subprocesses:
- Error
- Compensation

Are you wondering if you could model the example without event subprocesses and instead just attach events? Yes, you could. We did it that way in figure 2.91. In terms of sequence, the process works identically to the one shown in figure 2.89 on the preceding page. There is, however, a small but important difference: In the second model, adding an additional guest and ordering the alternative meal do not take place within the dinner preparation subprocess, but within the parent process instead. This has the following consequences (which apply particularly to global subprocesses):

- If responsibility for the subprocess lies with another parent process, two different roles take care of executing the subprocess and handling the related events. If the handling takes place within the subprocess, the same role has to take care of it.
- If the subprocess is global and thus reusable, each parent process must specify how it reacts to both events. On the other hand, if handling takes places within the subprocess, it is reused as well —for good or ill.
- Global subprocesses cannot access directly the data of the top-level process (or their parent processes); some data mapping is required. Data mapping is not required with an event subprocess.
