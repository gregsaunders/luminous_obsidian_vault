## Relevance in BPMN

Tasks and gateways are two of three flow elements we’ve come to know so far: Things (tasks) have to be done under certain circumstances (gateways). What flow element is still missing? The things (events) that are supposed to happen. Events are no less important for BPMN process models than tasks or gateways. We should start with some basic principles for applying them. In section 2.2 on page 27, we saw:

- Catching events and throwing events
- Start events, intermediate events, and end events

**Catching events** are events with a defined trigger. We consider that they take place once the trigger has activated or fired. As an intellectual construct, that is relatively intricate, so we simplify by calling them catching events. The point is that these events influence the course of the process and therefore must be modeled. Catching events may result in:

- The process starting
- The process or a process path continuing
- The task currently processed or the subprocess being canceled
- Another process path being used while a task or a subprocess executes

**Throwing events** are assumed by BPMN to trigger themselves instead of reacting to a trigger. You could say that they are active compared to passive catching events. We call them throwing events for short, because the process triggers them. Throwing events can be:

- Triggered during the process
- Triggered at the end of the process

**Start events** are therefore events that always occur. The process cannot trigger an event before it has even started. The simplest application of a start event is shown in figure 2.29. When the event occurs, the process starts.

![[Journal/Jeff/01 Business stuff/Jeff's Learnings/Learnings/Real Life BPMN Training/attachments/Pasted image 20240507150206.png]]

**Note:** The question mark in the circle indicates that this event can be allocated to a certain type. So far, we have only covered none events. The possible event types are explained in the following sections.

Different events may trigger the process, which could be modeled as shown in figure 2.30. It is important that each event triggers its own process instance.

![[Journal/Jeff/01 Business stuff/Jeff's Learnings/Learnings/Real Life BPMN Training/attachments/Pasted image 20240507150331.png]]

On the other hand, suppose you want to model several events that have to take place before the process starts. A lot of people would model this situation as shown in figure 2.31 on the next page.

This is intuitive, but unfortunately it is not correct, and few BPMN beginners understand why it is not correct. The reason is that the AND merge does not support the correlation already mentioned in section 2.1.4 on page 26, so the process will not recognize the two events as being associated. We will explain this problem in greater detail in section 2.6.14 on page 58, and we will describe how BPMN provides the solution.

The process may require that a specific intermediate event occurs, as shown in figure 2.32. After task 1 completes, event 1 has to occur before task 2 can complete. With the token approach, the token waits at event 1 until it occurs. Only then does the token continue, and it starts task 2.

![[Journal/Jeff/01 Business stuff/Jeff's Learnings/Learnings/Real Life BPMN Training/attachments/Pasted image 20240507150549.png]]

![[Journal/Jeff/01 Business stuff/Jeff's Learnings/Learnings/Real Life BPMN Training/attachments/Pasted image 20240507150703.png]]

**Note**: The none event (as explained in section 2.2 on page 27) is not a catching event. It belongs to the throwing events.

How can we represent that a process has to wait for two events? What we show in figure 2.33 is flawed. After task 1 completes, the token continues and waits for event 1 to occur. If event 2 occurs while the token is waiting on event 1, the token will not notice it. Even worse, if event 1 occurs after event 2, the token continues and then waits for event 2 to occur. Since event 2 already occurred, the token will wait forever.
![[Journal/Jeff/01 Business stuff/Jeff's Learnings/Learnings/Real Life BPMN Training/attachments/Pasted image 20240507150819.png]]

The semantics of catching events is therefore not to check for a condition that already may have been fulfilled, but to treat the catching event as a transitory signal that vanishes immediately after the occurrence. The process therefore can handle the event only if it is in a ready-to-receive state at exactly the moment it occurs. This details can usually be ignored in purely functional process modeling, however, it must be adhered to in technical process modeling (section 6.4.5).

If we need to wait for two events that may occur independently, but both events must occur before the process can continue, we represent the situation as in figure 2.34 on the next page.

We can model attached intermediate events with BPMN. These do not explicitly require waiting, but they do interrupt our activities, both tasks and subprocesses (which will be discussed later). Such intermediate events are attached because we position them at the boundary of the activity we want to interrupt. A token running through the process shown in figure 2.35 would behave this way:

![[Journal/Jeff/01 Business stuff/Jeff's Learnings/Learnings/Real Life BPMN Training/attachments/Pasted image 20240507151242.png]]

- The token moves to task 1, which starts accordingly.
- If event 1 occurs while task 1 is being processed, task 1 is immediately canceled, and the token moves through the exception flow to task 3.
- On the other hand, if event 1 does not occur, task 1 will be processed, and the token moves through the regular sequence flow to task 2.
- If event 1 occurs only after task 1 completes, it ceases to matter.

![[Journal/Jeff/01 Business stuff/Jeff's Learnings/Learnings/Real Life BPMN Training/attachments/Pasted image 20240507151427.png]]

Attached intermediate events do not have to result in canceled activities because of the non-interrupting intermediate event. It sounds awkward, but it is useful. The token moves through the process section shown in figure 2.36 on the next page as follows:

- The token moves to task 1, which starts accordingly.
- If event 1 occurs while task 1 is being processed, the token is cloned. Task 1 continues to be processed while the second token moves to task 3, which is now also processed. This procedure may even take place repeatedly, that is, the event can occur many times. Each occurrence results in another cloned token.
- If event 1 does not occur, task 1 will be completed, and the token moves through the regular sequence flow to task 2.
- If event 1 occurs only after task 1 completes, it ceases to matter.

**Throwing intermediate events** are triggered by the process. That means a token occurring at such an event triggers it, then immediately moves on. Throwing events do not lead to canceled activities, which is why they can never be attached. They occur only in the sequence flow. We already know the none intermediate event, which can be used to model the entry into a defined status. This is a throwing event too.

![[Journal/Jeff/01 Business stuff/Jeff's Learnings/Learnings/Real Life BPMN Training/attachments/Pasted image 20240507151850.png]]

In the following sections, we introduce the event types to be used when working with BPMN. We also explain how you can react to different events using the event-based gateway. The event types are:

- Message
- Timer
- Error
- Conditional
- Signal
- Terminate
- Link
- Compensation
- Multiple
- Parallel
- Escalation
- Cancel

#### Message events

Sooner or later, most processes require communication, which can be represented in BPMN by means of the message event. You’ll recognize it as the small envelope. The general application of the message event is shown in figure 2.37 on the following page.

![[Journal/Jeff/01 Business stuff/Jeff's Learnings/Learnings/Real Life BPMN Training/attachments/Pasted image 20240507152036.png]]

The meaning of message in BPMN is not restricted to letters, e-mails, or calls. Any action that refers to a specific addressee and represents or contains information for the addressee is a message. In figure 2.38 on the next page for example, the pizza ordering issue has been fully modeled: We choose a pizza, and we order it. We then wait for the pizza to be delivered. After delivery, we eat. Notice that there is no order pizza task.

![[Journal/Jeff/01 Business stuff/Jeff's Learnings/Learnings/Real Life BPMN Training/attachments/Pasted image 20240507152144.png]]

What’s shown in figure 2.39 on the following page would in fact **be wrong**: The throwing intermediate event pizza ordered implies that we have ordered a pizza. If a corresponding task were added, it would result in a double definition and therefore be meaningless.

![[Journal/Jeff/01 Business stuff/Jeff's Learnings/Learnings/Real Life BPMN Training/attachments/Pasted image 20240507152238.png]]

In figure 2.40, we show a message leading to cancellation. In this scenario, we administer a web application. When a user notifies us that the website does not work, we immediately search for the error. But maybe the user is mistaken, and the website is fine. Maybe the user’s Internet connection is defective. If the user tells us about the false alarm, we cancel the search and swear at the user for wasting our time. If the error is actually found, however, we eliminate it and simultaneously figure out who caused the error. If the user caused the error, we can swear at the user for a different reason. If the user is not at fault, however, we thank him or her graciously for letting us know about the problem.

![[Journal/Jeff/01 Business stuff/Jeff's Learnings/Learnings/Real Life BPMN Training/attachments/Pasted image 20240507152722.png]]

![[Journal/Jeff/01 Business stuff/Jeff's Learnings/Learnings/Real Life BPMN Training/attachments/Pasted image 20240507152751.png]]

#### Timer events

The timer event is often used when working with BPMN because it is so flexible to apply. A clock icon represents the timer event. You can see it applied in figure 2.42. You can use timer events to start processes:

- Once, at a scheduled time
- Repeatedly at scheduled times
- At timed intervals
- Relative to other events
As an intermediate event, a timer event can stop a process until:
- A scheduled time arrives.
- A defined span of time has elapsed.
- A time relative to another event expires.
![[Journal/Jeff/01 Business stuff/Jeff's Learnings/Learnings/Real Life BPMN Training/attachments/Pasted image 20240507152914.png]]

Figure 2.43 on the next page shows a few examples of applications. Time moves on no matter what we or our processes do, so timer events can exist only as catching starts or intermediate events.

![[Journal/Jeff/01 Business stuff/Jeff's Learnings/Learnings/Real Life BPMN Training/attachments/Pasted image 20240507153127.png]]

You can model countdown times with an attached timer event. They are used this way frequently. You can specify upper time limits - the maximum time allowed for a processing task - for instance. Figure 2.44 on the following page shows a process in which a task may take a maximum of 30 minutes. If the time expires before the task completes, the choose pizza task is canceled, and we cook pasta instead. In either case, we eat the meal at the end.

![[Journal/Jeff/01 Business stuff/Jeff's Learnings/Learnings/Real Life BPMN Training/attachments/Pasted image 20240507153337.png]]

Timer events can be non-interrupting. Figure 2.45 on the preceding page shows another example of this. Before we can eat, we have to prepare the meal and set the table, but we only start setting the table 10 minutes before the meal is ready.

![[Journal/Jeff/01 Business stuff/Jeff's Learnings/Learnings/Real Life BPMN Training/attachments/Pasted image 20240507153405.png]]

#### Error events

Do your processes run completely error-free? If not, you can identify potential errors in your models as a step toward eliminating them, or as part of modeling escalation processes. In BPMN, error events are represented by a flash symbol. Apply them as shown in figure 2.46.

![[Journal/Jeff/01 Business stuff/Jeff's Learnings/Learnings/Real Life BPMN Training/attachments/Pasted image 20240507153453.png]]

The BPMN specification does not specify what an error may be. As the modeler, you have to decide that. Section 4.5.1 on page 134 has some hands-on tips.

An error is a serious event in BPMN, so it can be modeled only as an attached intermediate event. This means that an error during task execution must be handled in a specific way: As a throwing event, it can be modeled only at the end of a process path so that the participant knows the process has failed. The parent process should likewise recognize the failure. (We explain the interaction between parent and subprocesses in section 2.8 on page 66. You’ll also find an example of applying an error event there.)

#### Conditional

Sometimes we only want a process to start or to continue if a certain condition is true. Anything can be a condition, and conditions are independent of processes, which is why the condition (like the timer event) can only exist as a catching event (figure 2.47).

![[Journal/Jeff/01 Business stuff/Jeff's Learnings/Learnings/Real Life BPMN Training/attachments/Pasted image 20240507153659.png]]

We can enhance our pizza process with conditions. If we want to have frozen pizza, the process starts as shown in figure 2.48 on the next page. We take the pizza from the freezer and turn on the oven. But we only put the pizza in after the temperature in the oven reaches 180◦C, and we only take it out to eat after it is done.

![[Journal/Jeff/01 Business stuff/Jeff's Learnings/Learnings/Real Life BPMN Training/attachments/Pasted image 20240507153838.png]]

If we know how long the pizza needs to cook, we can specify this in the process model by substituting a timer event for the last conditional event. The whole thing would then look as shown in figure 2.49.

![[Journal/Jeff/01 Business stuff/Jeff's Learnings/Learnings/Real Life BPMN Training/attachments/Pasted image 20240507153933.png]]

#### Signal events

Signals are similar to messages, which is why you can model them in BPMN as events just as you can with messages (figure 2.50). The symbol for a signal is a triangle. The essential difference between a signal and a message is that that latter is always addressed to a specific recipient. (An e-mail contains the e-mail address of the recipient, a call starts with dialing the telephone number, and so on.) In contrast, a signal is more like a newspaper advertisement or a television commercial. It is relatively undirected. Anyone who receives the signal and wants to react may do so.

![[Journal/Jeff/01 Business stuff/Jeff's Learnings/Learnings/Real Life BPMN Training/attachments/Pasted image 20240507154143.png]]

We saw a new frozen pizza on TV, and we are keen to try it. Figure 2.51 illustrates this new situation.

![[Journal/Jeff/01 Business stuff/Jeff's Learnings/Learnings/Real Life BPMN Training/attachments/Pasted image 20240507154204.png]]

We buy the pizza, but we keep it in the freezer until we’re really hungry for pizza. That’s a conditional event. After trying the new pizza, we go to Pizzatest.de to rate the new product. That’s a signal. It is a signal for the general public too. (Pizzatest.de actually exists, by the way, which proves again that you can find simply everything on the Internet!)

#### Terminate events

Let’s look at the abstract example in figure 2.52. We already discussed (simple) Key Performance Indicator (KPI) analysis in section 2.3.2 on page 30, and we therefore know that this process always takes 55 minutes. After task 1, tasks 2 and 3 can be processed simultaneously. Processing task 2 takes more time than does processing task 3, which is why it determines the runtime of the process. A token that runs through the process is cloned in the AND split. The first token stays in task 2 for 45 minutes; the second token stays in task 3 for 30 minutes. The second token arrives at the none event first, where it is consumed. After 15 more minutes, the first token arrives at the upper none event, where it is consumed too. Since no more tokens are available, the process instance finishes after 55 minutes.

![[Journal/Jeff/01 Business stuff/Jeff's Learnings/Learnings/Real Life BPMN Training/attachments/Pasted image 20240507154502.png]]

So far, so good, but what happens if we already know that, after having completed task 3, task 2 has become redundant? This is a frequent situation with parallel task executions related to content. In such cases, we can apply the pattern shown in figure 2.53.

![[Journal/Jeff/01 Business stuff/Jeff's Learnings/Learnings/Real Life BPMN Training/attachments/Pasted image 20240507154606.png]]

We use the terminate event to make sure that all available tokens are consumed immediately. That leads to the termination of the process instance, consequently, you can use the terminate event as an end event only. (See figure 2.54 on the following page.)

![[Journal/Jeff/01 Business stuff/Jeff's Learnings/Learnings/Real Life BPMN Training/attachments/Pasted image 20240507154745.png]]

#### Link events

The link event is a special case. It has no significance related to content, but it facilitates the diagram-creation process. As shown in figure 2.55, you can draw two associated links as an alternative to a sequence flow. Here, associated means there is a throwing link event as the exit point, and a catching link event as the entrance point, and the two events are marked as a pair - in our example by the designation A. Sometimes we use color coding to mark the association.

![[Journal/Jeff/01 Business stuff/Jeff's Learnings/Learnings/Real Life BPMN Training/attachments/Pasted image 20240507155544.png]]

Link events can be very useful if:

- You have to distribute a process diagram across several pages. Links orient the reader from one page to the next.
- You draw comprehensive process diagrams with many sequence flows. Links help avoid what otherwise might look like a spaghetti diagram.

Link events can be used as intermediate events only (figure 2.56).
![[Journal/Jeff/01 Business stuff/Jeff's Learnings/Learnings/Real Life BPMN Training/attachments/Pasted image 20240507155643.png]]

#### Compensation events

In practice, we apply compensation icons (see figure 2.57 on the next page) only to transactions even though BPMN permits other uses. (See section 2.8.5 on page 74.) We execute tasks in our processes that sometimes have to be canceled later under certain circumstances.

![[Journal/Jeff/01 Business stuff/Jeff's Learnings/Learnings/Real Life BPMN Training/attachments/Pasted image 20240507160120.png]]

**Typical examples are**:

- Booking a train or airline ticket
- Reserving a rental car
- Charging a credit card
- Commissioning a service provider

In figure 2.58, we see this process: On Friday at 1 p.m. we agree with our partner either to go to the theater or to spend the evening with friends. In both cases, we have to do something binding, either to reserve the theater tickets or make the arrangements with our friends. When evening arrives, perhaps we no longer feel like going out at all. We then have to cancel the arrangements we made with the theater or our friends before we can collapse in front of the TV in peace.

We can represent the latter part of the model more compactly with a compensation event, as shown in figure 2.59 on the following page. If we don’t feel like going out, we have to cancel all our arrangements; we don’t have to check which ones to cancel.

There are special rules for handling compensations:

![[Journal/Jeff/01 Business stuff/Jeff's Learnings/Learnings/Real Life BPMN Training/attachments/Pasted image 20240507160442.png]]

![[Journal/Jeff/01 Business stuff/Jeff's Learnings/Learnings/Real Life BPMN Training/attachments/Pasted image 20240507160512.png]]

- Throwing compensations refer to their own processes, so the event is effective within the pool. This shows how this event type differs from a throwing message event.
- Other attached events can take effect only while the activities to which they are attached remain active. In contrast, an attached compensation takes effect only if the process triggers a compensation and the activity to which the compensation is attached successfully completes.
- Attached compensation events connect to compensation tasks through associations, and not through sequence flows, which would otherwise be common usage. BPMN thus emphasizes that compensations are beyond the regular process sequence; executing one is an exception.
- The obligatory compensation task is a special task type that we explain with other task types in section 2.7 on page 61.

![[Journal/Jeff/01 Business stuff/Jeff's Learnings/Learnings/Real Life BPMN Training/attachments/Pasted image 20240507160916.png]] ![[Journal/Jeff/01 Business stuff/Jeff's Learnings/Learnings/Real Life BPMN Training/attachments/Pasted image 20240507161121.png]]

#### Multiple events

![[Journal/Jeff/01 Business stuff/Jeff's Learnings/Learnings/Real Life BPMN Training/attachments/Pasted image 20240507161212.png]]

We can use the multiple event (figure 2.60) to summarize several events with a single symbol. The semantics are simple:

- If we model the multiple event as a catching event, only one of the summarized events has to occur to start or continue the process or to cancel the task.
- If we model a multiple event as a throwing event, it means that all of the summarized events are triggered.

Figure 2.61 applies the multiple event to our pizza scenario. In the example, we try a new pizza after having seen it on TV or after a friend recommended it. After eating it, we will rate the pizza on Pizzatest.de and in turn inform our friend if we also recommend this pizza.

![[Journal/Jeff/01 Business stuff/Jeff's Learnings/Learnings/Real Life BPMN Training/attachments/Pasted image 20240507161404.png]]

The model in figure 2.62 describes the same process, but the events are fully modeled.

![[Journal/Jeff/01 Business stuff/Jeff's Learnings/Learnings/Real Life BPMN Training/attachments/Pasted image 20240507161508.png]]

![[Journal/Jeff/01 Business stuff/Jeff's Learnings/Learnings/Real Life BPMN Training/attachments/Pasted image 20240507161556.png]]

#### Parallel events

The parallel event (see figure 2.63 on the next page) supplements the multiple event. While a catching multiple event has XOR semantics - it occurs as soon as one of its contained events occurs - the parallel event uses AND semantics. It doesn’t occur until all of its contained events occur. Because the throwing multiple event already implies AND semantics, the specification defines parallel events as catching events only.

![[Journal/Jeff/01 Business stuff/Jeff's Learnings/Learnings/Real Life BPMN Training/attachments/Pasted image 20240507161755.png]]

#### Escalation events

The escalation event (see figure 2.64) shows communication between parent and subprocesses. We discuss it in section 2.8 on page 66 with the help of an example.

![[Journal/Jeff/01 Business stuff/Jeff's Learnings/Learnings/Real Life BPMN Training/attachments/Pasted image 20240507161908.png]]

#### Cancel events

You can use the cancel event only in the context of the transactions we discuss in section 2.8.5 on page 74. That section also has examples of applying this event type.

#### Event-based gateway

We learned about the exclusive data-based (XOR) gateway option in section 2.3.1 on page 28 as a way to use different paths without regard to the data being processed. In figure 2.65 on the facing page, we had to choose a recipe (pasta, steak, or salad) first, and depending on result of the choose recipe task, the XOR gateway routed us to the cook pasta, or cook steak, or prepare salad task accordingly.

![[Journal/Jeff/01 Business stuff/Jeff's Learnings/Learnings/Real Life BPMN Training/attachments/Pasted image 20240507162057.png]]

Users of other process notations recognize this type of branching, but BPMN gives us another way to design process paths: the event-based gateway- event gateway, for short. This gateway does not route based on data, but rather by which event takes place next. To understand the benefit, consider the process shown in figure 2.66 on the next page: We order pizza and wait for it to be delivered. We can eat only after we receive the pizza, but what if the pizza doesn’t arrive after 60 minutes? We’ll make an anxious phone call, that’s what! We can model this with the event gateway (figure 2.67). Now, in contrast to the data-based XOR split, the token waits at the event gateway for one of the subsequent events to occur. Once any one event occurs, the token takes the respective path. If other events then take place, they are ignored. This is XOR semantics.

![[Journal/Jeff/01 Business stuff/Jeff's Learnings/Learnings/Real Life BPMN Training/attachments/Pasted image 20240507162305.png]]

![[Journal/Jeff/01 Business stuff/Jeff's Learnings/Learnings/Real Life BPMN Training/attachments/Pasted image 20240507162337.png]]

As you can see in figure 2.68 on the next page, not all intermediate events combine with the event gateway. You can, however, combine it with the receive task, which we discuss in section 2.7 on page 61.

![[Journal/Jeff/01 Business stuff/Jeff's Learnings/Learnings/Real Life BPMN Training/attachments/Pasted image 20240507162434.png]]

As an instantiating gateway, the event gateway can be used to start a process. You can combine them with other events to trigger a process and, as shown in figure 2.69 on the next page, they can be merged through XOR merges.

![[Journal/Jeff/01 Business stuff/Jeff's Learnings/Learnings/Real Life BPMN Training/attachments/Pasted image 20240507162533.png]]

![[Journal/Jeff/01 Business stuff/Jeff's Learnings/Learnings/Real Life BPMN Training/attachments/Pasted image 20240507162609.png]]

#### Event-based parallel gateway

There is a variation on the event gateway: the event-based parallel gateway. Use of this symbol expresses that all subsequent events have to occur before a process can be started completely. It therefore provides correlation not provided by the simple AND merge.

![[Journal/Jeff/01 Business stuff/Jeff's Learnings/Learnings/Real Life BPMN Training/attachments/Pasted image 20240507162710.png]]

The lower model shown in figure 2.70 causes the following behavior:

- If event 1 occurs, the process instance is started and a token is born.
- The new token waits at the AND merge.
- If event 2 occurs, the related process instance already started is identified. (This is cor- relation.) At event 2, another token is born.
- The second token also moves to the AND merge, where it merges with the first token. Only a single token leaves by the outgoing path.

The upper model shows that the allocation to the running process instance would not be carried out. Instead, two isolated instances start in which a token waits forever at each AND merge. This strict correlation semantics of BPMN doesn’t always further the goal of making process models easy to understand!
