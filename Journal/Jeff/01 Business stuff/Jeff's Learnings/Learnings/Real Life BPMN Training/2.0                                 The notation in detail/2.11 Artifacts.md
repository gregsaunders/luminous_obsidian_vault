### Annotations and groups

We use annotations to supplement our diagrams. Annotations can contain almost anything you find useful, and you can connect them to other elements with associations. Usually, we use annotations to provide insight on the execution of tasks (see figure 2.107). (In figure 2.7 on page 31, we used annotations to record the average processing times; in figure 2.72 on page 63, we used them to explain what condition cancels a looping task.)

In figure 2.107, we noted that the food is to be prepared in the kitchen but eaten in the dining room. Because this information refers to several elements in the diagram at the same time, we can group them. Like all artifacts, groups do not influence execution semantics, so donâ€™t confuse them with things like subprocesses. You can apply groups any way you like - even across pool boundaries. Groups can be extremely useful for marking off parts of your models to which only certain conventions apply. We will return to this possibility in subsequent chapters.

###  Custom artifacts

BPMN allows you to introduce symbols that suit your own modeling conventions and particular information needs. In figure 2.108, we expanded the process of delivering pizzas with a bicycle and a computer. These appliances help us execute tasks. Apply the same rules to custom symbols as to all artifacts: connect them with associations to any flow object; place them in any position in the diagram.
