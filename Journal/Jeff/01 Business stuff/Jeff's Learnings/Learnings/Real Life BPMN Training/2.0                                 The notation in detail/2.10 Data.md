In the description of a process, BPMN focuses on the sequence flow: the sequence of tasks, gateways, and events. All other potentially relevant aspects to the process execution are treated as less important. The same applies to information or documents used in, or generated by, the process. You can account for these aspects in your diagrams by modeling so-called data objects, which represent all kinds of information regardless of their physical nature. They can include paper documents, abstract information, or electronic data records.

Data objects are coupled to flow objects and sequence flows by means of (data) associations. In addition to their designation, they can be assigned a specific status, which is marked by square brackets in BPMN. Typical statuses for data objects are:
- Generated
- To be checked
- Checked
- To be revised
- Revised
- Rejected
- Approved

The abstract example in figure 2.105 on the following page shows the following interaction of pools 1 and 2: In task 2.1, pool 2 generates the data object 2.1 with the initial status A, which we visualize by means of the directed association from task toward data object. Task 2.3 needs this data object as input, which is why we have drawn another directed association there. Furthermore, task 2.3 consumes the output of task 2.2.

Because these tasks directly follow one another, we can omit the directed associations, and we can connect data object 2.2 directly to the sequence flow. This is just a visual shortcut of the input/output relationship. Task 2.3, in turn, transforms data object 2.1 from status A to status B, and it sends it through a message flow directly to pool 1. Pool 1 waits for this message and then forwards the received data 2.1 to task 1.3, where it is transformed from status B to status C.

You have to pay attention when using message flows and directed associations in the same diagram, because they look similar. The most important distinctive features are:

- Message flows are dashed, the beginning of the line is a small circle, and the arrow is a closed triangle.
- Directed associations are dotted, the beginning of the line is unmarked, and the arrow has an open base.

BPMN defines data as an additional category aside from flow objects and artifacts. This relevance is based primarily on the desire to execute BPMN process models directly, and this requires explicit observance of data. For collaboration diagrams, there are a couple of other interesting symbols besides the message object. We have applied them to the delivererâ€™s pizza process in figure 2.106 on the next page.

Any new pizza order that the deliverer receives serves as input for the process. Recognize this as the arrow in the top left of the diagram. The order may include one or more pizzas (as expressed by the usual symbol for multiple instances), and the bake pizza task must execute a corresponding number of times. The number of instances also corresponds to the number of items in the collection input data object. The collect money task requires the object for the delivery person to ask for the correct amount. The accountant enters the sale in a journal. This sale is the output of the process, recognizable by the black arrow. The journal is a data store that exists, unlike the data objects, regardless of the specific process instance. The journal remains available long after the process instance has ended. If the pizza company was more up to date, its accountant could use software or a database.
