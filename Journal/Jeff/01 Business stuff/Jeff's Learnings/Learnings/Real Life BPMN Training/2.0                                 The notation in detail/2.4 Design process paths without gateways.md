## Design process paths without gateways

Some people don’t like gateways. They think gateways make process diagrams too comprehensive or even inflated, and they would rather do without all those diamonds. While gateways are optional - you can instead model the logic of the XOR, AND, and OR gateways directly with the tasks - you have to be careful. It’s rare that you can eliminate gateways entirely.

Figure 2.21 on the facing page illustrates an alternative to the OR split as well as to the XOR merge. The upper and the lower process models are equivalent, but the upper model shows two flows routing directly to task 4. It also represents the OR split with conditional flow symbols: the small diamonds connected to task 1. Conditional flow symbols may connect only to tasks or subprocesses, and only as outlets. They may not be used with gateways or events.

If you read section 2.3 on page 28 carefully, you likely see the problem with this: If only one of the two conditions applies, everything is okay, but if both apply, they generate two tokens in the OR split and so trigger task 4 twice thanks to the XOR merge. This isn’t necessarily wrong, but it probably isn’t intended. And that brings us to the first problem associated with gateway abstinence:

**We cannot model synchronizations (that is, AND merges) without gateways.**

The second problem is that we can’t combine conditional checks. We can’t represent the process logic shown in figure 2.22 without gateways because of the intermediate event.

The third problem is that conditional flows follow the same semantics as the OR split. In other words, the defined conditions must not exclude each other. Because the OR split is compatible with the subsequent XOR split, this isn’t crucial, but modelers and those who use their diagrams need to be aware of this. Otherwise, in our experience, misunderstandings quickly result.

Would it be better to use gateways all the time? No, there’s no need for that either. A simple loop, for example, can be better off without XOR merges because it’s less confusing for the inexperienced. And because BPMN permits multiple flows from start events to end events, the diagrams can be nicely compact. We modeled the process in figure 2.23 on the next page with and without gateways to illustrate this. (Yes, technically speaking, the models are not identical: The upper one includes the XOR gateway syntactically, so several paths must be used. It requires that conditions 1 and 2 never occur at the same time. This is not the case in the lower model, where both conditions can apply.)
