As we showed in Chapter 2, BPMN has more than 50 symbols. That’s far too many for strategic process models, and it is why we use only a subset of symbols. Use any subset you choose for strategic process models, but our suggestions follow.

### Pools and lanes

After reading section 2.9 on page 78, you should assess figure 3.3 critically. After all, BPMN requires a conductor for each process, one who orchestrates (assigns tasks to) all the people and systems in the process. But this process isn’t controlled by a workflow engine, so there is no conductor here. When the requesting department sends its request to Human Resources, there is no forwarding of the instance, so you should model it as a message flow. Also, you should assign the requesting department to another pool.

In figure 3.4, we did assign the requesting department to another pool. It now reports its vacancy explicitly in the form of a message to HR and, if the vacancy can be filled, the requesting department is informed likewise.

![[Journal/Jeff/01 Business stuff/Jeff's Learnings/Learnings/Real Life BPMN Training/attachments/Pasted image 20240508144337.png]]

While this representation has its charm, a problem still exists: The applicants are not orchestrated by a conductor either. (A conductor for this pool would have equal control over both applicants and HR.) Figure 3.5 on the following page shows the collaboration when each party has its own pool.

The more we detail our model of the collaboration, the more questions arise, and the more we can detect inaccuracies and inconsistencies. How does an applicant learn about the vacancy? If he or she responds to a published notice, we should model this with a signal event, not a message. And the diagram still shows that we are waiting for one application instead of several, nor is it clear that we check applications immediately upon receipt or collect them all before checking. Finally, it appears that the applicant only has to submit an application to achieve employment. No interview required!

We could clarify all these issues with Robert and revise the model accordingly, but that’s not the purpose of the strategic process model. Robert grasped the meaning of figure 3.4 with little explanation. It is doubtful that he would react well to our later diagrams if he encountered them when we weren’t there to explain the symbols for the signal event or the different cardinalities of instances (one job posting, many applications). Robert wouldn’t understand the model at first glance, and he wouldn’t accept it any more. Consequently, we put figure 3.5 on the following page aside for further development at the operational level.

For strategic process models, we usually abstain from using multiple pools unless the customer is external to the organization. In such cases, a separate pool lets us model an overview of order processing, for instance, or complaint handling in the second pool. In figure 3.6, we show the customer as a collapsed pool so that we can focus on the process sequence at the time an order is received. Wouldn’t it be nice if we could model all processes this way?

![[Journal/Jeff/01 Business stuff/Jeff's Learnings/Learnings/Real Life BPMN Training/attachments/Pasted image 20240508144859.png]]

We can’t. The recruiting process example shows why we can’t. In reality, we often have external partners that cannot be assigned to their own pools without making our strategic diagram so complex that it no longer serves our needs. On the other hand, we often deal with processes involving internal customers such as the hiring department in the recruiting process.

### Tasks and subprocesses

Tasks often appear in our strategic models, but subprocesses appear only rarely. Task typing (see section 2.7.1 on page 61) is something we don’t do for strategic process models though, and we also abstain from applying markers (see section 2.7.2 on page 63) with one exception: the loop marker. That is intuitive for most people, so we use it for strategic process models.

![[Journal/Jeff/01 Business stuff/Jeff's Learnings/Learnings/Real Life BPMN Training/attachments/Pasted image 20240508145406.png]]

Subprocesses should refine processes and process models. In the recruiting process model, we could define the steps advertise job, submit application, check application, and fill vacancy as subprocesses. It’s likely that they stand for complex operations and not simple tasks. From what Robert told us, the report vacancy task, however, seems to be limited to completing and sending an Excel spreadsheet. That doesn’t sound like a complex operation, so we leave it as a task. To represent this thinking, we come up with figure 3.7.
![[Journal/Jeff/01 Business stuff/Jeff's Learnings/Learnings/Real Life BPMN Training/attachments/Pasted image 20240508145728.png]]

The question now is if we want to model collapsed subprocesses fully on the strategic level. Usually, we don’t do that because the point of the strategic level is not to show detailed operational sequences. We can’t make it correspond smoothly to the subprocesses level of detail anyway because of the semantic inconsistencies already described.

### Gateways

The recruiting process shown in figure 3.7 on the preceding page is based on the assumption that we can fill vacancies when and as we like. That’s not the reality, because sometimes we can’t find a qualified candidate. We could model this and other special cases with gateways, but not at the strategic level.

At the strategic level, we only deal with the so-called happy path, meaning that we show the process path and results that we’d like to see. Most of the time, the happy path is sufficient. But if a process has different triggers, as in a customer-driven process, for example, we do sometimes have to model multiple paths at the strategic level. This is the time for a gateway.

We recommend using gateways as follows (refer to figure 3.8 on the next page):
- Use XOR gateways for splits, that is, when no conditional flows exit directly from tasks. XOR gateways are easier to intuit than conditional flows. Target audiences understand a split when they see it.
- Merge tasks without XOR merge. In other words, let arrows flow directly into tasks. Such gateways (especially loops) only confuse inexperienced users; besides, omitting them results in more compact diagrams. Although we must use the gateways for merges in front of intermediate events and AND gateways, those should not appear at the strategic level.
- Use the AND gateway with no direct exit from the tasks to synchronize and make parallel. Parallel parts of a process need to be synchronized again later, so the AND gateway should be used in both cases to make the representation uniform and to avoid confusion.
- Do not use the OR gateway. It quickly results in meaningless constructs if you’re not careful. Theoretically, you can represent any OR gateway by combining XOR and AND gateways. Again, however, this kind of complexity should not be part of a strategic diagram.
- Do not use the complex gateway. This representation of complex splitting and merging logics does not belong at the strategic level.

### Events and event-based gateway

We recommend using start and end events at the strategic level to mark the start and the end of the process. You could do without these symbols, and the recruiting process would look like figure 3.9 on page 108. The diagram is more compact, but you can’t see the process trigger or its desired end condition. That’s a particular problem for the start-to-end presentation we’re trying to create at the strategic level.

![[Journal/Jeff/01 Business stuff/Jeff's Learnings/Learnings/Real Life BPMN Training/attachments/Pasted image 20240508151242.png]]

Compared to start and end events, intermediate events often require a little explanation. It is difficult for many people to understand at the outset that a catching event means that the process waits for that event to occur. We have to label them descriptively to make the meaning clear. With the exception of none events, catching intermediate events are too complicated for the strategic level.

We only permit some of the possible event types at the strategic level:

*None events* may be used as start, intermediate, and end events. The intermediate event can indicate process status during the execution. Process owners readily accept this kind of status as milestones they can use to monitor progress. In figure 3.10, we show two milestones defined for the recruiting process. At the strategic level, process models are sometimes so clearly laid out that you could define a milestone for every step. In such lovely cases, it is probably better to leave explicit milestone indicators out of the diagram just for simplicity’s sake.

![[Journal/Jeff/01 Business stuff/Jeff's Learnings/Learnings/Real Life BPMN Training/attachments/Pasted image 20240508151431.png]]

We permit *message* and *timer* events as start events and intermediate events at the strategic level. The symbols are virtually self-explanatory.

The *conditional* event is problematic because people don’t recognize it right away. It can be useful at the strategic level, however, because process owners want to see at a glance which conditions trigger a process or when a process has to execute. A common example is the tendering process, which, for compliance reasons, has to start as soon as an order exceeds a certain amount. This is why we include the conditional event in our strategic level toolkit. We use it often.

We try to apply a type to every process start event. In other words, we model it as a message or a timer or a conditional event. We succeed almost every time. If none of these events apply, we consider first if we have chosen the correct process start - if our pattern matches the process, or if the process actually starts earlier or later than we thought. Once in a while, we model a none type start event at the strategic level. If we fully model a subprocess, that none start event is important for correct syntax because a subprocess can only be started by its parent process.

Intermediate events can be also attached to tasks and subprocesses, but we avoid using them in this context at the strategic level because they indicate an exception. We want to record only the standard sequence for now. We also exclude the event-based gateway from strategic diagrams; reacting to events is an inappropriate level of detail for the strategic level.

### Data and artifacts

Text annotations are permitted at the strategic level. We use them often. In the recruiting process example, annotations helped us to add information to the vacancy filled end event, namely that the employment contract was signed at that point.

People easily understand the group frame, so it is permissible at the strategic level, but we find that it gets used infrequently because strategic models are clear enough without it. Inexperienced modelers often mistake the group frame for an expanded subprocess, so you may want to hide the group frame at first. You can reveal it after the modelers’ understanding has grown.

Data objects quickly result in visual overload. On the other hand, they can make two things readily apparent:
1. The essential input and out put parameters of a process or a subprocess.
2. The type of communications between process participants.

The second item technically is a message-flow domain. Because we deliberately avoid using multiple pools - and hence their message flows - at the strategic level, we resort to data objects.

When we ask the Human Resources manager, Robert, how information is transmitted in his recruiting process, he says, "We receive requirement notifications by email. We then post the job notices to our website and also on the major Internet job sites. We receive applications by postal mail and email, though the email responses have been growing as a proportion of the total."

We can model Robert’s communication by using data objects attached to the sequence flows by means of associations (see figure 3.11 on the following page). We usually attach the essential input and output data to the sequence flow between the start event and the first task or between the last task and the end event. That may not be correct in a formal sense because the output is not passed to the end event, but it is intuitive and therefore workable at the strategic level.

### Custom artifacts

As described in Chapter 2, you can add your own symbols to BPMN as long as you only use them as artifacts. You can connect artifacts only by associations to flow objects (tasks, gateways, or events) to prevent them from influencing the sequence flow. They represent references to things beyond the main sequence.

In our experience, artifacts are well suited to the strategic level for meeting the particular requirements of your process owners. One classic is to represent the software systems used for individual tasks of subprocesses. We usually use a cuboid for this. The cuboid is used for the same purpose in Unified Modeling Language (UML) use case diagrams, which is why it makes sense to us.

When we ask what IT systems the recruiting process uses, Robert says, "So far almost none. The job description is created in Excel; all the other things are done without any special software." Find the corresponding representation in figure 3.12.

![[Journal/Jeff/01 Business stuff/Jeff's Learnings/Learnings/Real Life BPMN Training/attachments/Pasted image 20240510094105.png]]

Depending on the industry and the particular needs, you can introduce custom artifacts for completely different purposes. Suppose the insurance sector faces regulatory pressure regarding minimum requirements for risk management. This makes identifying risks in the process documentation necessary; you can use a custom artifact to flag the risks associated with execution of tasks and subprocesses.

### Hide and reveal symbols

You can see the extensions added to the recruiting example for milestones, data forwarding, and IT systems in figure 3.13. This information is particularly helpful for discussing a process, but because they tend to overload a diagram and add to the potential confusion, not all users of the diagram will want to see them. It is useful to be able to hide and reveal the extra symbols as needed. This is a question we often get in our BPMN workshops; here are our notes:

- Hiding and revealing is not a feature of the notation. This feature must be provided by the BPMN tool you work with.
- Several of the BPMN tools make it easy to hide and reveal artifacts such as data, annotations, or custom symbols.
- Hiding and revealing is more complicated for none intermediate events because they attach to the sequence flow. When you hide them, you get unexplained and unsightly gaps unless your tool is intelligent enough to rearrange the diagram accordingly. (Suppose an XOR merge was applied before an event that suddenly became redundant because the arrows could enter the task after the event directly.) So in general, hiding and revealing flow objects like activities, events, and gateways is problematic, which is why most BPMN tools do not provide a hide-reveal feature, or they limit its function.
