No chain can ever be stronger than it's weakest link. ​Similarly, every system must have a **[constraint]** that limits it's output. We know this because no system has infinite output... for example, you will never find any company with infinite sales or profit!

Note that every chain will have ONE (and only one) weakest link. Strengthening the other links can never increase the overall strength of the chain, because they are not the weakest. In fact, strengthening a non-weakest link will probably DECREASE the overall strength of the chain due to the added weight:

Similarly, attempts to optimize each individual process and function tend to ignore the impact on the constraint, thereby causing a variety of unforeseen problems that reduce the overall performance and effectiveness of the organization. For example, if sales orders are the constraint, optimizing production output can result in overproduction. Such large quantities of excess finished goods inventory will in turn incur hefty carrying charges and cost of capital. A resulting cash crunch might also delay payments to vendors, thereby triggering supply problems which delay orders, tarnish the reputation with customers and reduce future sales. ​

What if we made efforts to utilize the weakest link more fully? We could exploit it more by minimizing idle time of the chain, or subordinate everything else to it by avoiding sudden jerks that add additional stress when it is fully loaded. Once we have mastered how to utilize the chain well, we might begin searching for ways of strengthening the weakest link itself. Even a small increase in the strength of the weakest link could have a rather large impact on the overall strength of the chain:

A constraint limits the output of every system, whether we acknowledge it or not. When properly identified and managed, **constraints provide the fastest route to significant improvement** and form the bedrock for continuous growth. When ignored, the constraint may lie idle, squandering system capacity. An out-of-control constraint may also wreck havoc on delivery schedules and cause unpredictable delays. It is therefore crucial for any manager to make the most of their constraint and learn to manage it well.  
TOC shifts the focus of management from optimizing separate assets, functions and resources to increasing the flow of throughput generated by the entire system. TOC's key processes are focused on removing barriers that prevent each part from working together as an integrated whole.  

## Knowledge Check

Many people overestimate their grasp of the Theory of Constraints. Take a moment to check your understanding so far.  
  
Imagine you are responsible for managing the below process flow. Each letter represents a different sub-process such as sales, design, operations stage 1, operations stage 2, customer invoicing, payment collection, etc. Take a moment to visualize a simple sequential process that you are familiar with, perhaps in manufacturing or services, or even a government process such as issuing driver's licenses.

You are given the above report detailing the overall efficiency of each sub-process.

1. Where will you FOCUS most of your attention?
2. Where will you avoid putting ANY attention?​

---

Which sub-process did you choose...?  
  
Did you have any questions or information that you felt might be missing?

---

Just after you decided where to focus your attention, you receive a report containing the maximum capacity of each sub-process:

![Picture](https://www.tocinstitute.org/uploads/1/1/0/9/110976539/flow-line-capacity_orig.png)

Substitute any measurement of capacity that suits your chosen process. For example, tons per hour. ​

1. Were you focusing in the right place? Most people focus on Process B, even though process D is actually the constraint
2. What are the necessary consequences if you focus primarily on optimizing process B?
3. The efficiency report remains equally accurate before and after receiving the capacity report. What changed?
4. What would you expect the maximum possible output from such a system to be?
