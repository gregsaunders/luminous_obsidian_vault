The **Theory of Constraints** is a process improvement methodology that emphasizes the importance of identifying the "[system constraint](https://www.tocinstitute.org/constraint-definition.html)" or bottleneck. By leveraging this constraint, organizations can achieve their financial goals while delivering on-time-in-full (OTIF) to customers, avoiding stock-outs in the supply chain, reducing lead time, etc.

​Common benefits of implementing the Theory of Constraints include better control over operations, less inventory, reduced conflicts between team member and drastically reduced firefighting. Often, additional capacity gets exposed without further capital investment or hiring additional workers.

- **The Five Focusing Steps** – the original expression of TOC which will be explained in detail in this article [[Journal/Jeff/01 Business stuff/Jeff's Learnings/Theory of Constraints (TOC)/TOC Framework/10. The Five Focusing Steps (POOGI)|10. The Five Focusing Steps (POOGI)]]
- **Throughput Accounting** – a robust method of measuring operations which removes certain problematic distortions in financial accounting practices to accurately measure progress towards the goal and facilitate better decision-making  
- **TOC Thinking Processes & Philosophy** – a set of problem solving tools and assumptions for developing breakthroughs across a wide variety of situations and environments. They help decide: 
    1. _What to change?_
    2. _What to change to?_
    3. _How to cause the change?_
- **TOC Applications** – highly evolved strategies and tactics that apply to specific industries or environments such as S-DBR for make-to-order discreet manufacturing, hospital management, rapid replenishment for distribution & retail, and Critical Chain for project environments. These methodologies, developed using the TOC thinking processes, are beyond the scope of this article but will be references with links at appropriate places so that you can learn more. 

Despite it's name, the "Theory of Constraints" is extremely practical in that it helps find simple, effective solutions to real-world problems.

## Delivering Extraordinary Performance Improvements

Implementing the Theory of Constraints has yielded remarkable results for companies around the world. An [independent study](https://www.tocinstitute.org/uploads/1/2/7/9/12796657/toc_impact_study.pdf) discovered that companies achieved the following  impact (on average):

These results were observed across various geographies and industries. In many cases, they represent a partial implementation of TOC tools, leaving us to wonder what sort of impact might have been possible using the the full set of applications.  

## Constraint Theory Works for Services Also

The overwhelming popularity of Dr. Goldratt’s bestselling business novel “The Goal” (set in a manufacturing company) has led some to believe that the Theory of Constraints applies primarily to the manufacturing environment.  
  
Although initially developed in response to specific challenges in this sector, other TOC applications have been developed for a wide variety of industries using the [TOC Thinking Processes](https://www.tocinstitute.org/toc-thinking-processes.html). These are successfully implemented in sectors like Heavy Capital Equipment, Retail, Banking, FMCG, Logistics, Job Shops, Mining, Healthcare, etc. TOC has also been applied in Not-for-Profits including primary education, organized religion, the military, the judicial system and others with equally impressive results.

## Overview of TOC Applications

Eli Goldratt developed specific applications or tools to assist in specfic industry situations: 

- **Availability in Supply & Distribution:** Reliable Rapid Replenishment
- **Availability in Finished Goods:** Simplified Drum-Buffer-Rope (S-DBR) for make-to-stock of make-to-availability
- **On-Time Production:** Simplified Drum-Buffer-Rope (S-DBR) for make-to-order
- **On-Time Assembly:** Full Kit
- **On-time Projects:** Critical-Chain Project Management
- **Turnaround of Sick Units:** Evaporating Cash Constraint
- **Increasing Customer Demand:** Un-Desirable Effect, Unrefusable "Mafia Offer"
- **Reducing Demand Risk:** Customer Segmentation
- **Causing Change:** 6 Layers of Resistance/Buy-In
- **Sound Financial Decision-Making:** Operational measurements T/I/OE
