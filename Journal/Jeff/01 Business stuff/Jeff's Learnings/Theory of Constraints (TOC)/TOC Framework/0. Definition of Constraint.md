# Constraint
noun  |  con·​straint  |  kən-ˈstrānt​  

In everyday language, the word "constraint" could refer to just about any inconvenience, limitation, setback, restriction or fluctuation in capacity. ​Sometimes it seems like constraints are lurking everywhere! ​  
  
But according to Dr. Goldratt, the word constraint means something specific:  
## A constraint is what "limits a system from achieving higher performance versus it's goal"

​The constraint is what, if we had just a little more of it, would generate higher Throughput (sometimes referred to as "contribution"). Throughput is a useful way to measure the flow of goods and services to market and to help guide sound decisions and actions to improve it over time.

Common benefits of implementing the Theory of Constraints include better control over operations, less inventory, reduced conflicts between team member and drastically reduced firefighting. Often, additional capacity gets exposed without further capital investment or hiring additional workers.

## Delivering Extraordinary Performance Improvements

Implementing the Theory of Constraints has yielded remarkable results for companies around the world. An independent study discovered that companies achieved the following  impact (on average):

These results were observed across various geographies and industries. In many cases, they represent a partial implementation of TOC tools, leaving one to wonder what sort of impact might have been possible using the the full set of applications.  

## Constraint Theory Works for Services Also

The popularity of Dr. Goldratt’s business novel “The Goal” (set in a manufacturing company) has led some to believe that the Theory of Constraints applies primarily to the manufacturing environment.  
  
TOC was initially developed to address specific challenges in this manufacturing, other TOC applications have been developed for a wide variety of industries using the [[Journal/Jeff/01 Business stuff/Jeff's Learnings/Theory of Constraints (TOC)/TOC Framework/11. TOC Thinking Process (TP Tools)|11. TOC Thinking Process (TP Tools)]]. These are successfully implemented in sectors like Heavy Capital Equipment, Retail, Banking, FMCG, Logistics, Job Shops, Mining, Healthcare, etc. TOC has also been applied in Not-for-Profits including primary education, organized religion, the military, the judicial system and others with equally impressive results.
