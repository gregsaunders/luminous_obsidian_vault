# Constraint
noun  |  con·​straint  |  kən-ˈstrānt​  

In everyday language, the word "constraint" could refer to just about any inconvenience, limitation, setback, restriction or fluctuation in capacity. ​Sometimes it seems like constraints are lurking everywhere! ​  
  
But according to Dr. Goldratt, the word constraint means something specific:  

### A constraint is what "limits a system from achieving higher performance versus it's goal"

​The constraint is what, if we had just a little more of it, would generate higher Throughput (sometimes referred to as "contribution"). Throughput is a useful way to measure the flow of goods and services to market and to help guide sound decisions and actions to improve it over time.
