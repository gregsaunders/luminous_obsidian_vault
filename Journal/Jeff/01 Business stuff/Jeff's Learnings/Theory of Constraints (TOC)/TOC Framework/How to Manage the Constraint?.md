Assuming we decide to keep the constraint in **Market Demand** – one must still monitor Capacity Constrained Resources (CCRs) as potential future “weakest links.” Fluctuations in market demand and product/service mix can cause sudden shifts in the load on CCRs, potentially creating new constraints in a short period of time.  
  
To prevent this from happening, one can calculate the current load on each CCRs and thereby estimating the "Planned Load" based on sales orders in hand. A rise in this Planned Load gives an early warning when a new constraint is emerging and can help estimate safe delivery promise dates as well.   
  
When a CCR threatens to become active, several possible actions can be taken depending upon the situation:

- Increase the lead time of order delivery dates promised to customers to manage their expectations
- Divert capacity from one product line or function to another (e.g. deploying cross-trained workers onto a different process)
- Increase pricing to temporarily reduce demand (e.g. surge pricing by taxi cab operators)
- Decline orders from lower priority customers, for example those with a reputation for not paying on time
- Outsource work at the relevant CCR(s)
- Increase capacity at the relevant CCR(s)

  
Thus, Planned Load is a critical control system that can give a warning when changes in the market might turn a critical resource into a constraint, so that appropriate corrective actions can be taken, before the new constraint emerges.

 

## Controlling Flow Through The Constraint

Time buffers (in a make-to-order environment) or stock buffers (in a make-to-availability environment) provide a simple way to control flow and focus efforts towards utilizing the current resources. Through a simple color coded system, Blacks and Reds can be expedited, Ambers can be monitored, and Greens can be left to progress without intervention.  
  
It is especially important to monitor these colors at the constraint or CCR location(s). They guide the operation to ensure that highest priority items are being completed first (Blacks first, then Red, Amber and Green in that order).  
  
​​Periodically, the reasons for buffer penetration (missing due date performance, fresh stockouts, etc.) should be analyzed to reveal improvement areas and possible new constraints. But by the time this data reveals a resource to have become a real “trouble maker,” it might be too late to take the corrective actions in time to preserve on-time delivery. ​

 

## Key Takeaways About Constraints

In summary, most “operational improvements” achieve negligible financial impact. Yet, certain improvements offer the potential to generate tremendous results!   
​  
One “Active Constraint” governs Throughput at all times. Improvements that affect performance of this constraint impact sales and hence Throughput. Other changes do NOT affect sales. You can locate this active constraint by checking availability/reliability at each link.   
  
Understanding and managing the constraint is a powerful tool for genuinely improving the performance of any organization. Ignore it at your peril. ​Manage your constraint, or it will manage you!
