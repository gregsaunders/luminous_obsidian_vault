The TOC Thinking Processes (sometimes called TP Tools) are integrated problem-solving tools based on rigorous cause-and-effect logic. They enable us to create breakthrough solutions by identifying, challenging and correcting unexamined assumptions. When we are serious about on-going improvement, they help answer fundamental questions such as:

- “What To Change?”
- “What To Change To?”
- “How To Cause The Change?”

The Thinking Processes are based on the premise that every complex problem stems from a deeply rooted issue - a core conflict. This conflict spawns harmful symptoms, which we confuse for the problem itself. In a desperate attempt to mitigate the symptoms (firefighting), we oscillate between mutually exclusive courses of action and seek unhealthy compromises. Organizations create elaborate policies, measurements, and behaviours in an attempt to mitigate the symptoms. These band-aid solutions must be carefully removed, modified, and/or replaced. And of course, unless we address the core conflict it only grows worse and worse.

## TP Work Across Diverse Situations & Circumstances  

The TOC Thinking Processes can be used in any business situation, and even as a self-improvement tool to debug and transform one's life. For example, an Olympic hopeful twice failed to qualify for the swim team and was passing her prime. Her detailed TOC cause-effect analysis covered 11 pages with boxes and arrows. In the end, it revealed her need to correct just a few basic shortfalls:  

- Ensure that I always take time to stretch
- Remember to carry my water bottle to prevent dehydration  
- Think positive thoughts before bed each night
- Build a better communicative relationship with my coach
- Stop training when my body is too broken down and tired

She eventually bagged the gold medal in the 4 x 200 free relay in Atlanta, clocking a new world record! Later she went on to become a motivational speaker and returned to the Olympics as in the Triathlon several years later.

## Classic Thinking Process Tools  

Elaborate thinking processes were traditionally applied during a two-week workshop to identify the cause-effect logic and map a detailed solution. These typically included tools such as:

- **Current Reality Tree (CRT)** - traces all "Un-Desirable Effects" (UDEs) down to the root cause and ultimately identifies the core conflict
- **Evaporating Cloud (EC)** - articulates the core conflict clearly and surfaces it's hidden assumptions so that one can be invalidated
- **Future Reality Tree (FRT)** - maps the full implications of the proposed injections to ensure that they are sufficient to solve every UDE (actions which solve the conflict)
- **Negative Branch Reservation (NBR)** - unravels the logical dependencies of the negative side effect of an injection so that it can be more easily trimmed (eliminated)
- **[Prerequisite Tree](https://www.tocinstitute.org/prerequisite-tree.html)** (PRT) - Similar to Transition Tree for more elaborate / complex undertakings
- **Transition Tree (TT)** - Sequences a complete set of actions to get from a starting point to an end objective

The intense, very thorough tools have been used to create powerful readymade solutions, known as "Applications" for various business functions, including Finance & Measurement, Production, Distribution / Supply Chain / Procurement, Project Management, Marketing, Sales, Strategy, New Technology.

## The 3-Cloud Method  

Later, Dr. Goldratt developed a streamlined "3-Cloud Method" for more rapid diagnosis and implementation. This method, combined with established TOC applications and detailed implementation templates known as "Strategy and Tactic Trees," are extremely effective for solving many business problems.
