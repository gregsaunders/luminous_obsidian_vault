When driving continuous improvement, it is tempting to try to improve everything all at once. As thrilling as this might seem, it rarely leads to sustained improvement in the overall performance of the organization over time.  
  
This is because not all improvements are created equal... a few impact the constraint while most do not. This seemingly minor distinction makes all the difference.  
  
The classic analogy is a chain which has a specific lifting capacity. Note that the strength of this chain is determined by it's weakest link (the constraint):

![Constraint as a Chain's Weakest Link](https://www.tocinstitute.org/uploads/1/1/0/9/110976539/weakest-link3_orig.png)

Note that if you "improve" a non-weakest link by adding more steel, the overall strength of the chain can never increase. The strength of the chain can **only** be increased by strengthening the weakest link.   
  
​That is why improvements that impact the constraint influence the overall system performance disproportionately. Thus, _constraints represent the leverage-point to make substantial improvements with less effort in a relatively short time_. ​
