### Old School Sales Conversations
- Start with a technical problem (disparate, manual processes)
- Find the pain (Causes lost time, increased frustration etc.)
- Pitch the "what if" future (what if I can get you more time, fewer frusterations, etc.)
### Move to business problems
- Technical problem (disparate, manual processes)
- Ask why does this matter?
- What happens to the business health because of this?
- Electronic health records don not connect to the pharmacy in a major trauma hospital
- What big stuff can go seriously wrong in this situation?
- This is where the business problem start to present itself
### Without proper discovery we can't qualify the sale!
- Is there a problem you can fix?
- Does the prospect agree they have a problem?
- Does the Prospect want to fix the problem?
- Will the Prospect go on a journey with you to fix the problem?
### MEDDIC and BANT adds ZERO value to the buyer
- You can't measure the Gap if you don't define everything
