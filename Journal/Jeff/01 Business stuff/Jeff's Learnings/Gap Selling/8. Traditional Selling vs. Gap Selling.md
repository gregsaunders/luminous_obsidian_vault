## Traditional selling approach
- Buyer knows and states their problem
- Sales person gives product knowledge to the buyer
- Buyer is in control of thir decision
- Sales person missed opportunity to help make the best possible decision
## Gap selling approach
- Through proper questioning Sales person fully understands customer problem, impact, emotions around it and the root cause.
- Sales person determines customer desired state, problems solved, desired outcomes, new emotions.
- Sales person starts to discuss the real solution the customer wants.
- Questions are about getting information, not just how awesome the questions are
- Questions should be delivered conversationally not as an interrogation!
