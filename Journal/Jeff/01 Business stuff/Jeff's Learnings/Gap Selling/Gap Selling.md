## Future State
##### 1. Where does the buyer want to go once they have their current state fully understood? Time for more questions!
- How would you like this ... to work?
- How much time do you wish it will take?
- How many more ... would yoiu like to sell?
- How many more leads would you like to generate?
- How much less time would you like your employees spending on this?
- How much more revenue would this represent?

##### 2. Quantify where your customer wants to go
##### 3. Find the literal physical future state your customer wants by:
- Asking open ended questions
##### 4. Refuse open ended answers
- Pressing for specifics on how this will impact their business
- Better efficiancy is not a specific impact
- Reducing turn around by 20% and increasing production by 50% is!
- Never be satisfied with the first answer they give
- Without digging further and asking for clarification, there will be no way you will be able to fully determine how this future state is worth the time effort and money, having great business impact.
- Solving the wrong problem may leave the customer not thinking the problem not a big enough deal.
##### 5. It's all about envisioning outcomes
- If all of your prospects problems could disappear what would be the impact?
- Help place them in that frame of mind
- What would that world look and feel like to them
- Emphasize you have the goods to make that reality
- "Reason alone can never be a motive to the action of the will" Your prospect must feel strongly about the value of the change you are proposing, they will not move closer to the sale.
	- If you don't define the outcome your customer wants you are stuck selling them your service.
	- Once you know your customers future state, you are no longer selling a service, you are selling a desired outcome
	- **You are selling change**
##### 5. Make sure your prospect can articulate the details

## Do you have enough value to?
#### Switch? EFFORT
#### Pay for what you are asking? MONEY
#### Change Process? EFFORT
#### Go through he sales process? EFFORT
#### Do whatever it is they need to do to go with your service or product?
- NO GAP NO SALE!!!
- If you don't know why they should buy, why are you offering it?
### You have commitment to the above answers you have a qualified opportunity!
## Product Recommendation Structure - Now you can talk about product or service
##### Remember, buyers buy to fix business problems. Sellers fix the root cause with their product / services
- We must demonstrate the connection of how fixing the technical root cause translates to fixing business problems and impacts.
##### After your recommendation and customer agreement, more questions. and processes to follow.
- **Decision Criteria** - What are all the steps your prospect has to follow before they can decide to buy?
- **Buying process**
	- PO
	- Budget allocation
	- Procurement
	- IT evaluation
	- Who you need to engage with to get the deal
- **Always focus on the next yes. The path to deal closed**
## Troubleshooting
This will test how accurately you assessed their current state and desired future state. "I'm Confused. You said..."
##### Price objection - The price of what is too high?
- If the cost of the solution is a small fraction of the problem it fixes, you can defend it.
- Be careful, a high cost for a small gap will rarely close!
##### Going Dark
- I'm confused statements are strong in this situation
- Keep prospect focused on their business problems and impacts.
- Buyers often lose site of problems and impacts so refocus them away from daily activities and into solving their problem.
##### Timing
- Sometimes there are timing delays and competing initiatives.
- If you solve for a massive (big gap) problem, keep them focused.
- If your buyer has a bigger problem somewhere else where it is in their best interest to fix first, manage your sales cycle and close dates appropriately.
### Have the empathy to understand what your buyer is going through so you can help them get through!
