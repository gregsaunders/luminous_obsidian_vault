# How to Get Started with Application Lifecycle Management

## 1. Create a list of all applications deployed on your system**

To start with Application Lifecycle Management you first need to have all your applications, their dependent [components](https://help.ardoq.com/en/articles/44117-how-to-create-components), and their [references](https://help.ardoq.com/en/articles/44157-what-are-references) in Ardoq.

There are several ways to bring your data into Ardoq. You can manually add your components and references by using the [Grid Editor](https://help.ardoq.com/en/articles/44145-grid-editor), or you can easily import them using any of the following integration methods:

- _Upload your application data using [Ardoq’s Excel importer](https://help.ardoq.com/en/articles/43943-excel-integration)_
    
- _Upload your application data using [Ardoq’s ServiceNow integration](https://help.ardoq.com/en/articles/44072-how-to-import-servicenow-data-into-ardoq)_
    
- _Upload your application data using [Ardoq’s REST API](https://help.ardoq.com/en/articles/44146-rest-api-tutorial)_
    

Take advantage of our Excel import templates to streamline data entry and speed up the process:

- [Application Excel Template](https://liveshareuk1.seismic.com/i/vQOZu9oXr8nYBLf96bNvAeZ3ZaPXtf___xcAjqkCeEn5YNtdwjIZP9G5UI2qCb9AbY5wX5GeCYSEI8JpZ___eD1JAXYA7DzlOz___pha16lOmUl0gEQUALSIGN)
    
- [People and Organization Excel Templates](https://eng12e.seismic.com/i/vQOZu9oXr8nYBLf96bNvAeZ3ZaPXtf___xcAjqkCeEn5bJbCnh2pAaoXFVkHnW94VbxW1ZN57bqlCFLiPzK2wPGOiDp0KCazT___ADOznz5pf08EQUALSIGN)
    

The Excel importer integration is a one-time import way to bring your data into Ardoq. That being said, you can re-upload your data whenever you need to update it. With the [ServiceNow Integration](https://help.ardoq.com/en/articles/44072-how-to-import-servicenow-data-into-ardoq), you can easily synchronize your data with Ardoq and you can use the REST-API to automate documentation.

You can use [Surveys](https://help.ardoq.com/en/articles/44109-how-to-automatically-create-a-survey) and [Broadcasts](https://help.ardoq.com/en/articles/44025-introduction-to-broadcasts-powerful-messaging-automation-platform) to canvass key stakeholders across your entire organization about unmapped applications they might be using. Surveys are a fast and easy way to gather any kind of application data, while Broadcasts enables you to reach the right people at the right time by using powerful event-driven automation.

## 2. Prioritize your portfolio

As a next step, you will want to prioritize your application portfolio so it’s easier to tackle the most important applications first and drive value as fast as possible. You could for example segment and prioritize your portfolio to sort the applications that are most critical to your business strategy by creating a filter or [perspective](https://help.ardoq.com/en/articles/44114-perspectives). This approach allows you to focus on small parts of the portfolio. Another important thing to do is to set your completeness criteria for each segment. It’s important that you have 100% data completeness for your most critical applications, but you don’t need to apply that same standard to non-critical applications.

[![ardoq critical applications](https://ardoq-d6cb2423c4b1.intercom-attachments.eu/i/o/1790272/d588ad2c9836891b44f902ba/upload_4571257591671073821)](https://ardoq-d6cb2423c4b1.intercom-attachments.eu/i/o/1790272/d588ad2c9836891b44f902ba/upload_4571257591671073821)

## 3. Gather lifecycle data**

Next is identifying the lifecycle phase of your applications. In Ardoq, [create a **_Lifecycle Phase_** list field](https://help.ardoq.com/en/articles/44115-how-to-create-fields) to define the different lifecycle phases you’ve previously outlined. We recommend creating a **_Live_** [date range field](https://help.ardoq.com/en/articles/44158-what-is-a-field#h_868913e57d) as well to document the start/end dates of your live applications, and run a light version of lifecycle management.

[![ardoq create field](https://ardoq-d6cb2423c4b1.intercom-attachments.eu/i/o/1790273/8f4559192d07b55c69bbbb22/upload_12963380614845783982)](https://ardoq-d6cb2423c4b1.intercom-attachments.eu/i/o/1790273/8f4559192d07b55c69bbbb22/upload_12963380614845783982)

To create more detail, document the start/end dates for all other phases. More insight on exact dates for each lifecycle phase helps to plan more accurately for what is to come next. A date range will enable you to have a clearer understanding of your IT landscape needs in the future, which will make it easy to implement the changes needed or mitigate any potential risk to the change. We suggest setting the end date of one phase to match the start date of another. This is to avoid having a break in continuity, but it is not a requirement as you may certainly have gaps in handovers.

Now you are ready to assign the relevant phase to your applications. It can be a challenge to know the phase each item is in and where you can refer to to get this data. Fortunately, you can also easily gather this information with Ardoq’s [Surveys](https://help.ardoq.com/en/articles/44109-how-to-automatically-create-a-survey) and [Broadcasts](https://help.ardoq.com/en/articles/44025-introduction-to-broadcasts-powerful-messaging-automation-platform). A simple survey gathers the name of the application, the application’s lifecycle phase, start and end dates. Broadcasts reaches out to key stakeholders or [application owners](https://help.ardoq.com/en/articles/44024-broadcasts-how-to-use-intelligent-audience-targeting#h_e3fac9594f).

[![ardoq application owners](https://ardoq-d6cb2423c4b1.intercom-attachments.eu/i/o/1790275/b017ec3053bac672794d0cf9/upload_2214729929410228796)](https://ardoq-d6cb2423c4b1.intercom-attachments.eu/i/o/1790275/b017ec3053bac672794d0cf9/upload_2214729929410228796)

## 4. Visualize your portfolio**

Now that you’ve brought lifecycles and time into perspective, you can visualize and analyze your architecture in the [Timeline view](https://help.ardoq.com/en/articles/44061-timeline-view). The Timeline view is perfect for planning your application lifecycles and projects. It enables you to easily communicate your application roadmap, project roll-outs, or capability maturing. Our versatile grouping lets you visualize dependencies across domains, how your projects affect your capabilities, and how much your applications rely on technology that is being phased out.

[![ardoq timeline view](https://ardoq-d6cb2423c4b1.intercom-attachments.eu/i/o/1790277/6fead655b582df3c13195500/upload_6547862012019036360)](https://ardoq-d6cb2423c4b1.intercom-attachments.eu/i/o/1790277/6fead655b582df3c13195500/upload_6547862012019036360)

Here you can see the applications that are reaching end-of-life or other important milestone dates, such as automatic license renewals, or the release of a new version that will demand upgrade work. You can filter your application portfolio by _Lifecycle Phase = Phasing out_, for example, to have a better understanding of which applications you have to come up with a migration plan for.

To gain the contextual understanding and impact of the applications that are being phased out, use the [Block Diagram](https://help.ardoq.com/en/articles/44213-block-diagram), [Component Matrix](https://help.ardoq.com/en/articles/44049-component-matrix), or the [Dependency Map](https://help.ardoq.com/en/articles/44007-dependency-map) to work out the details of the application in question.
