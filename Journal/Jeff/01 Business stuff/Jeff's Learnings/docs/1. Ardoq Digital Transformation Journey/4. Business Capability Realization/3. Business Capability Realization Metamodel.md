# Business Capability Realization Metamodel

The metamodel below builds off of what was done in the Business Capability Modeling and Application Lifecycle Management guides. Because capabilities are realized by various, different parts of the organization, **we recommend starting with applications** and mapping them to the capabilities that they enable. Next, go through this guide again and expand the scope with other type of data such as people, processes, and information. If you don't have the data shown below or want to include more, Ardoq's flexible model allows for any adaptation.
