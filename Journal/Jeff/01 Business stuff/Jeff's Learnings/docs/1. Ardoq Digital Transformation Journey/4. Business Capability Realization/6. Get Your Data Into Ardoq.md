# Get Your Data Into Ardoq
The next step in your guide to understand how IT enables your business capabilities is to get your data into Ardoq. The component data should already be in Ardoq from the Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) and Business Capability Modeling (BCM) guides. The focus here is establishing the references between the application and the capabilities. If you donâ€™t have the component data in Ardoq yet, we recommend going through the ALM and BCM guides first.
