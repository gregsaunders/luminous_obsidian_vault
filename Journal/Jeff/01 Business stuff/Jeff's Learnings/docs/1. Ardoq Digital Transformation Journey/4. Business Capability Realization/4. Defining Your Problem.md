# Problem Definition 
List any additional problems that aren't covered in the Business Capability Realization guide here. 

Ardoq's BCR metamodel and guide are based on quick, time-to-value results from a range of customers and industries. Your organization will have its own unique goals and objectives that both the metamodel and guide can be adapted to.

### Common Problems
- How are my capabilities implemented?
- Do the most important capabilities have the right investment to succeed? Are we depending on critical roles, applications, or technology that are out of date or overleveraged?
- Who in the organization is responsible for critical capabilities and who realizes these capabilities?
- How interconnected and complex are these capabilities?
- How mature is our ability to realize a critical capability, and what is the desired maturity?
- What areas of the organization need investment or improvement?

### Prioritizing and Establishing a Success Criteria
Mapping capability realization can be daunting, especially with a large application portfolio. Therefore, we recommend breaking up the portfolio into smaller pieces and map the most critical applications and the capabilities they enable first so you can realize value fast.
