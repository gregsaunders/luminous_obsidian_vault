## Market Domain
The markets domain is used to describe spaces or forums through which the organization transacts the buying and selling of goods and services, rather than interacting directly with customers or external organizations.
    - Because many such markets are now automated with their own information and technical interoperability requirements, the markets domain has been placed in the physical-automated column.
## Market Component
A market component it is a space where buyers and sellers meet to transact the exchange of products and services.
    - Traditionally markets were physical spaces where prices and terms of exchange were negotiated fact-to-face.
    - In the twenty-first century markets are increasingly virtual (i.e. accessed via a communications network) and automated (i.e. buying and selling is carried out via applications and algorithms).
