## Business Information Domain 
The business information domain classifies physical or digital information assets designed primarily to be read by people, such as documents or video.
    - This type of information may be referred to as content or unstructured information.
    - The main concept in this domain is the business artefact.
## Business Artefact Component
A business artefact component is an item of unstructured information like a document, an image or a video or audio file.
    - Traditionally these formats are easily read by humans who can understand their meaning but less easily by machines.
    - However, as machine learning improves unstructured content is increasingly used an input into or output from automated processes.
