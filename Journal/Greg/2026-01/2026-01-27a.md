## Platform Breakthroughs Since November

1. **Smarter Search That Actually Works** - The system now understands what you're asking for, not just matching keywords. It finds relevant documents even when you don't know the exact terms, and prioritizes authoritative, recent sources automatically.
    
2. **GraphRAG for Context-Aware AI** - Documents aren't just stored as text, they're connected in a knowledge graph that captures relationships. When AI answers questions, it pulls in related context (who wrote it, what project it belongs to, what it references) for more accurate, grounded responses.
    
3. **Self-Hosted AI Infrastructure** - We built integrations for self hosted AI services instead of paying per-call to external providers. This means predictable costs, data never leaves our control, and we can swap or customize models as better ones emerge.
    
4. **One Platform, Any Business Domain** - Built a "plug-in" architecture where we can add new business capabilities without rebuilding the core.
