# Proposal

**Date:** December 2025  
**Prepared for:** [Company Name]  
**Prepared by:** Mark D. Robinson

---

## Executive Summary

This proposal outlines a **strategic partnership** arrangement where I would contribute to Luminous as a partner rather than a traditional employee or contractor.

Given our established working relationship and my experience building complementary technology, I believe this structure serves both parties well—combining the agility needed in the pre-funding stage with a foundation for long-term alignment.

> **What I Bring:** 17+ years of web development experience, deep Odoo expertise, Rust backend skills, and a track record of building intuitive enterprise UIs that users actually adopt.

---

## Recent Contributions

In advance of formalizing this arrangement, I've already begun contributing to the product:

1. **Performance Optimization** — Improved test case execution speed through targeted refactoring
2. **Architecture Review** — Scrutinized system architecture to ensure scalability under enterprise load
3. **Strategic Advisory** — Advised on embedding generation strategy for transactional data using narrative-based approaches

This early engagement reflects my commitment to the company's success and provides a preview of how this partnership would function.

## Proposed Role

I propose contributing across three core areas, ordered by immediate impact on fundraising readiness:

### 1. Detailed Project Scoping

Breaking large epics into actionable stories with clear acceptance criteria. Scoping deliverables within specific timeframes. Identifying dependencies early.

This complements high-level roadmap planning by ensuring the team has well-defined, executable tasks that lead to predictable delivery. Most importantly, this discipline ensures we can **identify and deliver the required functionality for MVP demos to potential investors**—demonstrating not just vision, but execution capability.

### 2. Backend Implementation

Performance-focused development drawing on recent Rust experience and a track record of optimization in Odoo implementations. Contributing to core backend systems and ensuring the application scales efficiently as the product grows.

### 3. UX & Product Design

Bringing polish and refinement to the user experience. Informed by my background in web design and ERP implementations where I consistently built interfaces that users adopted with minimal friction.

## Compensation Structure

I propose a hybrid model that reflects shared commitment while meeting practical requirements. Based on a market rate of **$150/hour**:

### Pre-Funding

| Component            | Rate       | Monthly (30 hrs/wk) |
| -------------------- | ---------- | ------------------- |
| Market Rate          | $150/hr    | $19,500             |
| Cash Component       | $60/hr     | $7,800              |
| **Equity Component** | **$90/hr** | **$11,700**         |

### Post-Funding

|Component|Rate|Monthly (30 hrs/wk)|
|---|---|---|
|Market Rate|$150/hr|$19,500|
|Cash Component|$90/hr|$11,700|
|**Equity Component**|**$60/hr**|**$7,800**|

_Monthly figures based on 30 hrs/week (~130 hrs/month). The lower cash rate pre-funding acknowledges the company's limited runway, while the higher equity component rewards taking on early-stage risk. Post-funding, the balance shifts as risk decreases._

## Time Commitment

| Item                       | Details                                       |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Minimum Hours              | 30 hours/week                                 |
| Monthly Cash (pre-funding) | ~$7,800                                       |
| Monthly Equity Value       | ~$11,700                                      |
| Flexibility                | Enables continued support of existing clients |

---

## Equity Terms

Proposed equity structure (specific percentages to be discussed based on valuation):

1. **Vesting Schedule** — 4 years with 1-year cliff (standard)
2. **Equity Percentage** — [To be discussed based on pre-funding valuation]
3. **Equity Class** — [To be discussed—expecting common shares]
4. **Valuation Basis** — [Pre-funding valuation or discount to upcoming round]

---

## Strategic Involvement

Beyond operational contributions, I'm interested in being a genuine partner with visibility into strategic decisions. After reflection, I don't believe I need a board seat or voting equity at this stage. Instead, I propose:

- **Information Rights** — Access to key company metrics and financial information
- **Strategic Meetings** — Standing invitation to board meetings or key strategic discussions as an advisor
- **Future Consideration** — Open discussion about formal board membership as the company evolves

This gives me the visibility and involvement I'm looking for without adding complexity to governance or the cap table.

---

## What I Bring to the Table

**Technical Experience**

- 17+ years web development, 11+ years software development
- Deep Odoo ERP expertise with recent Rust experience

**Complementary Skills**

- UX design & intuitive interfaces
- Detailed project scoping & client communication

**Recent R&D (Relevant to This Domain)**

- Implemented HNSW and IVF vector search algorithms in Rust, achieving working implementations with comprehensive test coverage
- Explored SIMD optimization (AVX2, NEON) for similarity computations—learned that modern enterprise deployments can target AVX2 directly, simplifying architecture significantly
- Designed document-level security architecture with pre-computed permissions at index time, avoiding expensive runtime permission checks

---

## Next Steps

I see this proposal as a starting point for discussion. Key items to align on:

1. Equity percentage based on current/pre-funding valuation
2. Time commitments
3. Confirmation of equity class and any voting rights
4. Pre-funding cash rate (proposal suggests $60/hr, open to discussion)
5. Start date and initial project focus
6. Termination terms and notice period

I'm flexible on the specifics and welcome your thoughts on what structure works best for the company at this stage.

Looking forward to continuing this conversation.
