**Key Discussion Topics:**

**1. Commercial Pilot Timeline and Objectives**
- Luminous aims to establish commercial pilots (not academic pilots) that transition into ongoing commercial contracts
- Target timeline: Launch when tailings ponds melt (approximately May) to capture full testing season
- Need contracts and agreements in principle before spring melt
- CDL program gate at end of January (January 28th) requires demonstrating progress on IP/licensing agreement

**2. Licensing and Relationship Agreement**
- AU working on draft licensing agreement and relationship agreement
- Decision pending on equity vs. royalty-based approach (discussion scheduled for next week)
- AU acknowledges January 28th deadline is not feasible for complete agreement but commits to letter of intent in early January

- Relationship agreement may be separated from licensing agreement to show progress

**3. Press Release and Communications**
- Both parties interested in joint press release about spin-off creation
- This would be AU's first Kereen spin-off company
- AU communications office recently had departure; tracking down new contact
- Target timing: late January to early February
- Co-branding and crediting AU on Luminous materials discussed

**4. Business School Engagement**
- Request to involve MBA students as potential support/case study
- Dr. Renzis noted limited success historically due to students having pre-existing projects and industry commitments
- Terry Beckman identified as contact; will follow up with introduction
- Acknowledged as lowest priority item

**5. Technology and Operations Details**
- Technology readiness level (TRL) approximately 8 - commercially viable
- Mass spectrometry will remain gold standard for water release, but biosensor provides high-frequency screening between bookend mass spec tests
- Sean has high correlation data between biosensor and mass spec from Curl Wetland pilot
- Paper in progress demonstrating quantitative value of biosensor (draft targeted by end of year)
- Pricing model: moving away from per-test pricing to value-based service model
- Service includes biosensor testing, technicians, and Greg's relational context engine data platform

**6. Physical Location and Lab Setup**
- No final decision on lab location
- Considerations: proximity to oil sands operations, access to talent
- Team distributed: Jeff (Lacombe/Calgary), Greg (Calgary), Sean (Squamish)
- Sean's lab at University of Calgary with Tyson Bookout as lab manager
- May initially operate from U of C, then establish new facility as scaling occurs
- Technician-level staff sufficient for biosensor testing (vs. graduate-level for mass spec)
- AU mentioned relationships with regional innovation network in Webuffalo and town/county of Athabasca

**7. Future Research and Product Roadmap**
- Sean continuing research at AU while commercial entity develops
- Next research phase: bioaugmentation (currently TRL 2-3)
- Vision: integrate bioaugmentation with engineered/controlled wetlands
- Sean discussing academic funding with CNRL for next research stage
- Agreement to share product roadmap with AU for alignment

**8. AU Internal Support**
- Dr. Renzis requested presentation from Luminous team to help sell concept internally at AU
- Presentation should cover: roadmap, industry engagement, market gap being filled
