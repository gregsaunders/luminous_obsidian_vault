### Core Structure Decision Questions

**Q1: Why consider two companies vs one company?**

**Protection Aspects:**
- **IP Protection**
  - Two Companies: IP is ring-fenced in Lewenza Labs, protected from operational risks
  - One Company: Simpler structure but IP exposed to business risks
- **Liability Management**
  - Two Companies: Operational risks contained in Luminous Bio Solutions
  - One Company: Single liability umbrella, but can be managed with insurance/contracts

**Operational Aspects:**
- **Administrative Overhead**
  - Two Companies: Higher costs, more complex administration
  - One Company: Streamlined operations, lower overhead
- **Strategic Flexibility**
  - Two Companies: More options for partial sale/investment
  - One Company: Simpler but less flexible for future transactions

### Control & Ownership Structure

**Q2: How should control be structured?**

**Voting Options:**
1. **Equal Voting Rights (33.3% each)**
   - Pros: Equal say in decisions
   - Cons: Potential deadlocks in 2-vs-1 situations
   
2. **Shawn Maintains Control**
   - Through voting shares while others get non-voting shares
   - Through board control with certain unanimous approval requirements
   
3. **Hybrid Structure**
   - Shawn gets voting control
   - All get equal economic rights
   - Certain decisions require unanimous approval

### Financial Structure

**Q3: How should equity and economics be handled?**

**One Company Scenario:**
- Equal equity splits (33.3% each)
- Different classes of shares (voting/non-voting)
- Vesting schedules for founders

**Two Company Scenario:**
- Lewenza Labs: Shawn's majority ownership
- Luminous Bio Solutions: Equal splits or proportional ownership
- Cross-company licensing agreements with royalties

### Implementation Questions

**Q4: What's the optimal timing for structure setup?**

**Options:**
1. **Immediate Full Setup**
   - Pros: Clear structure from start
   - Cons: Higher initial costs
   
2. **Phased Approach**
   - Start with one company
   - Split into two companies later if needed
   - Cons: More complex to separate later

### Key Agreements Needed

**Q5: What critical agreements are required?**

**For One Company:**
- Comprehensive shareholder agreement
- IP assignment agreements
- Employment/service agreements
- Non-compete/confidentiality agreements

**For Two Companies:**
- All above plus:
- Inter-company licensing agreement
- Service agreements between companies
- IP transfer agreements

### Future Considerations

**Q6: How does the structure impact future scenarios?**

**Growth Scenarios:**
- Investment rounds
- New partner addition
- International expansion
- Potential acquisition

**Exit Scenarios:**
- Buy-sell provisions
- Drag-along/tag-along rights
- Valuation mechanisms
- IP transfer rights

### Cost Implications

**Q7: What are the cost considerations?**

**Initial Costs:**
- One Company: ~$950 plus registry fees
- Two Companies: Double the incorporation costs
- Legal fees ($625/hour for lawyer review)

**Ongoing Costs:**
- Administrative overhead
- Legal/accounting compliance
