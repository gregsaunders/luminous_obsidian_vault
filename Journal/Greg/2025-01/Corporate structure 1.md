Below is a Q&A-style outline of the **key questions** the three partners—Shawn Lewenza (patent inventor), Greg Saunders (business operations & technology), and Jeff Violo (sales & marketing)—will need to answer as they decide between creating **one company** or **two companies** (Lewenza Labs for IP ownership, and Luminous Bio Solutions for commercialization). We’ll also look at what each question means, and the _possible answers_—including the pros and cons of each scenario.

  

**1. One Company vs. Two Companies**

  

**Q1: Why consider two companies (Lewenza Labs + Luminous Bio Solutions) instead of just one?**

  

**Meaning:** The partners want to understand whether they should keep intellectual property (IP) in a separate entity (Lewenza Labs) while using another entity (Luminous Bio Solutions) for operations and commercialization.

  

**Possible Answers & Rationale:**

1. **Separate IP Protection**

• **Yes (Two Companies):** Keeping patent/IP in Lewenza Labs helps ringfence and protect the IP, simplifying licensing or potential future transactions.

• **No (One Company):** A single entity holding both IP and operations is simpler in terms of administration and reduces overhead costs.

2. **Liability and Risk Management**

• **Yes (Two Companies):** If the operational entity (Luminous Bio Solutions) faces lawsuits or financial difficulties, the IP is sheltered in Lewenza Labs.

• **No (One Company):** One company can still manage risk through insurance, indemnities, and well-drafted contracts, though separation can offer an extra layer of protection.

3. **Strategic Flexibility**

• **Yes (Two Companies):** Easier to sell or license IP alone if a buyer is only interested in the technology, or to bring in investors specifically for the IP.

• **No (One Company):** You avoid complexity and potential friction between two entities. You can still license the IP externally if desired.

  

**2. Ownership and Control**

  

**Q2: How will voting control be allocated among Shawn (the inventor), Greg, and Jeff?**

  

**Meaning:** This determines who ultimately makes decisions, especially major ones (e.g., selling the company, setting strategic direction).

  

**Possible Answers & Rationale:**

1. **All Equal Voting Rights**

• **Pros:** Everyone has an equal say; fosters collaboration.

• **Cons:** Can cause deadlocks if 2 vs. 1 disputes arise; inventor’s IP might not be adequately protected.

2. **Shawn Retains Voting Majority**

• **Pros:** Protects Shawn’s IP interests; ensures a consistent vision.

• **Cons:** Greg and Jeff could feel they have less influence, which might affect motivation or alignment.

3. **Hybrid (Voting & Non-Voting Shares)**

• **Pros:** Allows Shawn to have the deciding vote while still giving Greg & Jeff economic (equity) ownership.

• **Cons:** More complexity in share classes, requires careful planning for future investments or expansions.

  

**3. Equity Splits and Share Classes**

  

**Q3: How should equity be split among the three partners if there is one company? Or how should shares be allocated across two companies?**

  

**Meaning:** Determines both economic benefit (profits, dividends, eventual sale proceeds) and degree of control each partner holds.

  

**Possible Answers & Rationale:**

1. **One Company, Equal Shares (e.g., 33.3% each)**

• **Pros:** Simple, intuitive, no confusion about responsibilities.

• **Cons:** May not reflect the IP inventor’s greater contribution or the ongoing management roles.

2. **Two Companies, Different Allocations**

• **Lewenza Labs (IP):** Shawn holds majority or sole ownership (plus the option for Greg/Jeff to purchase shares later).

• **Luminous Bio Solutions (Operations):** 33.3% each, or voting control for Shawn plus equal non-voting shares.

• **Pros:** IP is protected under Shawn’s control. Greg/Jeff can still share in operational upside.

• **Cons:** Extra legal/administrative work. Must define a licensing agreement between the two entities.

  

**4. Licensing and IP Agreements**

  

**Q4: If they go with two companies, what does the licensing agreement look like between Lewenza Labs (IP owner) and Luminous Bio Solutions (commercial operator)?**

  

**Meaning:** Clarifies the terms under which Luminous can use, develop, or sub-license the patented technology that resides in Lewenza Labs.

  

**Possible Answers & Rationale:**

1. **Exclusive License**

• **Pros:** Luminous Bio Solutions has exclusive rights to commercialize, which can be attractive to investors and clients.

• **Cons:** Requires clear terms on royalty rates, termination clauses, and responsibilities for improvements or updates to the IP.

2. **Non-Exclusive License**

• **Pros:** Lewenza Labs can license the IP to multiple entities if desired, potentially increasing revenue.

• **Cons:** Dilutes Luminous Bio Solutions’ unique advantage in the market.

3. **Hybrid License (Field-Specific)**

• **Pros:** Luminous might have exclusivity in certain industries or territories, while Lewenza Labs remains free to license to others outside that scope.

• **Cons:** Creates more contractual complexity and requires ongoing clarity about “fields of use.”

  

**5. Funding and Capital Contributions**

  

**Q5: How will the initial (and future) funding be handled?**

  

**Meaning:** Determines how each partner contributes cash, resources, or “sweat equity” and how that affects ownership in one or both companies.

  

**Possible Answers & Rationale:**

1. **All Partners Contribute Equally in Cash**

• **Pros:** Straightforward; fosters a sense of equality and shared risk.

• **Cons:** May not account for varying resources or the value of the patent already brought by Shawn.

2. **Shawn Contributes IP, Others Contribute Cash**

• **Pros:** Reflects real value of the patent.

• **Cons:** Hard to assign a precise monetary value to IP, leading to negotiations or external valuations.

3. **Phased Investment**

• **Pros:** Allows each partner to invest more or less over time as the company evolves; IP can be “vested” in exchange for equity.

• **Cons:** Introduces complexity around valuations at different stages.

  

**6. Roles and Responsibilities**

  

**Q6: What are the distinct roles of Shawn, Greg, and Jeff in managing the company/companies?**

  

**Meaning:** Clearly defining roles ensures everyone understands who does what (e.g., R&D, product dev, business operations, marketing, etc.).

  

**Possible Answers & Rationale:**

1. **Formal Titles and Departments**

• **Pros:** Easy to present to investors and clients; clarity for day-to-day decision-making.

• **Cons:** Might feel rigid or bureaucratic for a startup if roles overlap.

2. **Flexible, Collaborative Approach**

• **Pros:** Encourages cross-functional collaboration and agility.

• **Cons:** Potential for confusion or duplication of efforts if not well managed.

  

**7. Decision-Making Processes**

  

**Q7: How do we handle disagreements or high-stakes decisions?**

  

**Meaning:** A well-defined process for decision-making can prevent deadlock and conflict down the road.

  

**Possible Answers & Rationale:**

1. **Board of Directors Vote**

• **Pros:** Formal structure, especially if external advisors or investors are added.

• **Cons:** Can be slow; board seats and voting power must be carefully allocated.

2. **Majority/Minority Rights**

• **Pros:** Specific thresholds for key decisions (e.g., 2/3 majority needed for big moves like selling the company).

• **Cons:** Complex to draft if there are multiple classes of shares.

3. **Founder Veto Rights**

• **Pros:** Protects Shawn’s IP interests or other critical founder concerns.

• **Cons:** Potential to stall decisions if the veto is used too often.

  

**8. Shareholder Agreement (SHA) Essentials**

  

**Q8: What must the Shareholder Agreement cover?**

  

**Meaning:** The SHA governs the relationship among the shareholders and details on how ownership and control work.

  

**Possible Answers (Core Provisions) & Rationale:**

1. **Equity Splits & Classes of Shares**

• **Why It Matters:** Clarity on who owns what and how voting vs. non-voting shares function.

2. **Founder Roles & Responsibilities**

• **Why It Matters:** Minimizes overlap and confusion.

3. **IP Ownership & Licensing Terms**

• **Why It Matters:** If two companies are used, the SHA should reference licensing agreements.

4. **Decision-Making & Voting Thresholds**

• **Why It Matters:** Prevents deadlocks; outlines major vs. minor decision authority.

5. **Dispute Resolution Mechanisms**

• **Why It Matters:** Sets out how to handle disagreements (mediation, arbitration, buy-sell clauses).

6. **Exit Strategies & Buy-Sell Provisions**

• **Why It Matters:** Clarifies what happens if a founder wants out, or if the company is sold.

7. **Confidentiality & Non-Compete**

• **Why It Matters:** Protects the company’s competitive advantage and IP.

  

**9. Exit Strategies**

  

**Q9: What happens if one of the partners leaves or if there’s an acquisition?**

  

**Meaning:** Plans for different scenarios ensure stability and fairness, and can reassure investors/partners.

  

**Possible Answers & Rationale:**

1. **Buy-Sell (Shotgun) Clause**

• **Pros:** Provides a mechanism for partners to buy out a leaving partner.

• **Cons:** Can be stressful and requires financial resources to buy out shares.

2. **Vesting Schedules**

• **Pros:** Equity is “earned” over time, preventing a partner who leaves early from owning a large stake.

• **Cons:** Adds complexity; needs clear triggers and timelines.

3. **Drag-Along and Tag-Along Rights**

• **Pros:** Simplifies sale processes, ensures minority holders aren’t left behind.

• **Cons:** Minority owners must align with majority decisions (drag-along).

  

**10. Timing and Implementation**

  

**Q10: When and how should they formalize the structure (one vs. two entities) and finalize the Shareholder Agreement?**

  

**Meaning:** The partners need a timeline and next steps to ensure momentum and clarity.

  

**Possible Answers & Rationale:**

1. **Immediately, Before Taking Any Clients or Investments**

• **Pros:** Reduces risk of disputes later, clarifies positions from day one.

• **Cons:** Takes time and legal fees; might feel premature if the concept isn’t fully validated.

2. **Incrementally, Starting with One Company, Then Spinning Out the Second**

• **Pros:** Simpler to start; you only add complexity when the business has traction.

• **Cons:** Requires re-negotiation or “transfer” of IP in the future, which can be costly or lead to disputes.

  

**Final Thoughts**

  

**Deciding on one vs. two companies** boils down to **risk management**, **IP protection**, **administrative complexity**, and each partner’s **appetite for control and flexibility**. A well-drafted **Shareholder Agreement** can handle most of these concerns—whether there’s one legal entity or two.

  

By answering these **Q&A items**, Shawn, Greg, and Jeff can create a structure that fits their **long-term vision**, **protects the IP**, and sets them up for a successful working relationship. The more clarity they have in writing about each of these topics, the smoother their partnership—and potential future growth—will be.
