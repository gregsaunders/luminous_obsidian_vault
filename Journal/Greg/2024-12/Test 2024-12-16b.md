### Line breaks 

By default in Obsidian, pressing `Enter` once will create a new line in your note, but this is treated as a _continuation_ of the same paragraph in the rendered output, following typical Markdown behavior. To insert a line break _within_ a paragraph without starting a new paragraph, you can either:

- Add **two spaces** at the end of a line before pressing `Enter`, or
- Use the shortcut `Shift + Enter` to directly insert a line break.
