## Potential Missing Items in the Next 4 Weeks

1. [ ] **Internal Alignment and Kickoff** #docket #greg 
   - A project kickoff meeting or internal review sessions to ensure everyone understands their new roles, responsibilities, and the legal/structural decisions that will be finalized by mid-December.
   - Regular check-ins or updates on the incorporation process and IP finalization, ensuring the team knows the status and next steps.

2. [ ] **Preliminary Operational Setup** #docket #greg 
   - While there are tasks for identifying suppliers and finalizing legal structures, there’s no explicit mention of starting supplier outreach or negotiations in December. Even if just informational calls or preliminary quotations, early engagement might expedite the supply chain setup once the structure is finalized.
   - Some foundational operational tasks, such as initial internal communication protocol trials (Slack/Teams) or preliminary quality assurance documentation drafts, could be initiated earlier.

3. [ ] **Marketing and Branding Pre-Work** #docket #greg 
   - Although there are marketing tasks scheduled for early next year, it might be beneficial to start compiling basic marketing materials, gather preliminary brand ideas, or at least confirm naming conventions in December to avoid delays once the brand identity is finalized in January.
   - No immediate steps to begin outlining pitch decks or refining key messaging before the year-end. Early drafts could help move quicker once investor outreach ramps up in January.

4. [ ] **Risk Assessment and Mitigation Planning** #docket
   - A brief task to review potential regulatory or operational risks before year-end would help ensure that compliance strategies and permit applications in early 2025 are more efficient.
   - Preliminary identification of potential bottlenecks in the pilot execution or manufacturing scale-up plans could prevent surprises down the line.

5. [x] **Document Management and Version Control Setup** #docket ✅ 2024-12-23
   - Given all the documentation tasks (IP, legal, financial, operational), setting up a secure, organized document management system (e.g., SharePoint, a secure drive structure) before January might streamline future collaboration and compliance checks.
