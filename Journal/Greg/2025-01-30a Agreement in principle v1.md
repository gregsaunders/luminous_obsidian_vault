Below is a **sample Agreement in Principle** incorporating the key points from the summary. This document is **not** intended as a final, binding contract. Rather, it serves as an outline of the parties’ mutual intentions and a framework for drafting definitive agreements (such as a Founders’ Agreement, IP License, Shareholders’ Agreement, and Lab Services Agreement). The parties should seek **independent legal advice** to finalize any binding arrangements.

**AGREEMENT IN PRINCIPLE**

  

**Date:** [●], 2025

  

**1. Parties**

1. **Shawn Lewenza** (hereinafter “**Shawn**”)

2. **Greg [Last Name]** (hereinafter “**Greg**”)

3. **Jeff [Last Name]** (hereinafter “**Jeff**”)

4. **Luminous Bio Solutions Inc.** (to be incorporated or already incorporated) (hereinafter “**Luminous**”)

5. **Lewenza Labs Inc.** (a future entity to be formed) (hereinafter “**Lewenza Labs**”)

  

_(Collectively, the “Parties.”)_

**2. Background & Purpose**

1. **Athabasca University (AU) Ownership of IP**

• Shawn, as a professor at AU, is named inventor on a pending patent related to water testing and remediation technologies (the “**Technology**”).

• AU currently holds or controls all patent rights and/or pending patent application rights (the “**IP**”).

2. **Planned Commercialization**

• The Parties intend to **commercialize** the Technology through Luminous, which will initially license the IP from AU.

• In the future, the Parties anticipate that **Lewenza Labs** (once formed) will acquire the IP rights from AU, and subsequently **license** the IP to Luminous on an exclusive basis.

3. **Lab Services at the University of Calgary (U of C)**

• Shawn maintains a research laboratory at the University of Calgary Foothills Medical Campus, under an arrangement with U of C and AU.

• It is anticipated that certain testing and R&D services for Luminous will be performed in this lab under a **Lab Services Agreement** with U of C (and potentially AU).

4. **Objective of This Agreement**

• The purpose of this Agreement in Principle is to set forth the **initial understanding** regarding:

1. **Short-term** license from AU to Luminous

2. **Future** transfer of IP to Lewenza Labs and subsequent license to Luminous

3. **Proposed ownership and voting** structures of both Luminous and Lewenza Labs

4. **Lab services** arrangement with U of C

5. Timelines and **phased approach** for implementation

**3. Short-Term: Luminous + AU License**

1. **License from AU to Luminous**

• Luminous will negotiate and secure an **exclusive (or suitably protective) license** from AU for the Technology.

• The license shall permit Luminous to **conduct commercial activities**, including marketing, customer testing services, and product development.

2. **R&D Continuation at Shawn’s Lab**

• Shawn’s existing academic lab, physically located at U of C, will continue R&D efforts related to the Technology.

• Luminous may **contract** with the U of C lab (via a Lab Services Agreement) to provide testing and other services necessary for commercialization.

3. **Initial Capital Contributions**

• The Parties anticipate **modest** initial cash contributions (e.g., an equal or otherwise agreed amount by each Party) to fund Luminous’s startup operations.

• No significant personal R&D contributions from Greg or Jeff are expected in the near term, as Shawn’s academic lab will cover the early research phase.

**4. Future: Lewenza Labs as IP Holder**

1. **Timing of IP Transfer**

• Once the patent application is near grant or upon a mutually agreed event (the “**Trigger Event**”), **Lewenza Labs** shall be formed (or activated if pre-formed).

• **AU transfers or assigns** the patent/IP to Lewenza Labs, subject to any negotiation of fees, royalties, or other compensation to AU.

2. **License to Luminous**

• Upon transfer, Lewenza Labs shall grant an **exclusive license** to Luminous under terms consistent with facilitating commercial use and revenue generation.

• Luminous will pay **royalties** or license fees (if any) to Lewenza Labs, to be determined in a definitive license agreement.

3. **Ownership & Voting Structure of Lewenza Labs**

• **Shawn** will own **100%** of the **voting shares** (or at least maintain majority voting control).

• **Greg** and **Jeff** may receive **non-voting** shares or **stock options** in Lewenza Labs, enabling them to share in potential economic upside without affecting Shawn’s voting control.

• The parties acknowledge they may **revisit** the equity percentages based on contributions, performance, or additional agreements.

**5. Corporate Structure & Governance**

  

**5.1 Luminous (Commercial Entity)**

1. **Voting Control**

• **Shawn** will hold **voting shares** (either 100% or majority, as agreed) in Luminous.

2. **Economic Participation**

• **Greg** and **Jeff** will hold **non-voting common shares** in Luminous, granting them an **equal share** in dividends, retained earnings, and share appreciation.

• **Shawn** will also hold non-voting shares in proportion to the agreed split, ensuring overall **equal economic sharing** or a phased approach to equalization, subject to further negotiations.

3. **Governance & Decision-Making**

• Day-to-day operations: Greg and Jeff will lead business development, operations, and sales/marketing.

• Major decisions (e.g., capital raises, debt financing, major licensing terms) require Shawn’s approval, given his voting control.

• A **dispute resolution** mechanism (mediation or arbitration) will be included in definitive agreements to manage potential conflicts.

4. **Phased Equity Adjustments**

• The Parties acknowledge **Shawn** is considering a **phase-in** for Greg and Jeff’s equity, with the intent to reach an agreed upon share split within approximately **12 months**.

• The final equity and governance details shall be documented in a comprehensive **Shareholders’ Agreement** or **Founders’ Agreement**.

  

**5.2 Lewenza Labs (Future IP Entity)**

1. **Initial Ownership**

• Upon formation, **Shawn** will hold **100%** (or majority) of **voting shares** in Lewenza Labs.

2. **Non-Voting Shares/Options**

• **Greg** and **Jeff** may be granted **options** or non-voting shares at a defined strike price or formula, enabling them to participate economically in Lewenza Labs if they so choose.

• The details of such options (including vesting schedules, exercise price, triggers, etc.) will be set forth in a **Shareholders’ Agreement**.

3. **Primary Role**

• Lewenza Labs will exist as the **IP holding entity**, licensing the patent to Luminous and potentially other commercial partners or projects in the future.

• The Parties understand that Lewenza Labs may also seek funding or partnerships to facilitate IP development, subject to Shawn’s controlling vote.

**6. Lab Services Agreement (U of C / AU)**

1. **Scope of Services**

• Luminous will enter into a **Lab Services Agreement** (or similar contract) with U of C (and/or AU) to cover:

• Use of lab space and equipment at Shawn’s U of C lab;

• Ongoing R&D for process optimization;

• Testing of client or field water samples.

2. **Fees & Logistics**

• The Parties expect the lab services to be provided at **cost** or on a **cost-plus** basis, subject to negotiation with U of C’s administration and/or any relevant AU requirements.

• Shawn currently funds the technician performing water testing; Luminous may reimburse or cost-share if usage scales up.

3. **Future Relocation**

• If Luminous or Lewenza Labs establishes its **own facility**, or if AU prefers relocating to an AU-managed lab, the Parties shall work cooperatively to **transition** services from the U of C lab to the new facility.

**7. Phased Implementation & Next Steps**

1. **Phase 1: Immediate**

• **Incorporate or finalize Luminous** (if not yet done).

• Finalize **license agreement** with AU, allowing Luminous to commence commercial operations.

• Negotiate an **initial Lab Services Agreement** with U of C (and if necessary, AU).

• Prepare a **short-term Founders’ Agreement** or Shareholders’ Agreement for Luminous that reflects Shawn’s voting control and Greg/Jeff’s non-voting equity.

2. **Phase 2: Trigger Event**

• Upon **near-grant** or issuance of the patent, form (or activate) **Lewenza Labs**.

• **Transfer IP** from AU to Lewenza Labs under negotiated terms (with AU).

• Execute a **definitive license** from Lewenza Labs to Luminous, superseding the AU license.

3. **Phase 3: Further Expansion**

• Consider establishing a **standalone lab** (under Luminous or Lewenza Labs) if volumes or revenues justify it.

• Adjust equity stakes in **Luminous** (and potentially Lewenza Labs) according to the **phase-in** plan or as the Parties otherwise agree.

• Formalize any **options** for Greg and Jeff in Lewenza Labs once that entity is actively holding the IP.

**8. General Provisions**
