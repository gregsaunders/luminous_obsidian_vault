## Squarehead Updates Executive Summary

This knowledge graph pipeline transforms unstructured documents into a validated, queryable knowledge base using a **formal domain ontology** as its semantic foundation. The system enforces a configurable taxonomy of entity types organized into domain-specific categories, along with a comprehensive relationship grammar that defines valid semantic connections between entity classes. To ensure data quality at scale, the pipeline employs a **three-layer validation framework**—schema validation at extraction, domain-specific naming and structural rules at the semantic layer, and constraint logic at the database layer—that treats the ontology as enforceable law rather than advisory guidance. For ambiguous cases where automated validation is insufficient, the system uses **MAKER k-voting**, a consensus mechanism that makes k parallel LLM calls and requires majority agreement before accepting entity resolutions or relationship classifications. This architecture guarantees that all extracted knowledge conforms to the governing ontology while maintaining full provenance and bitemporal versioning for audit and rollback capabilities.
