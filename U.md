**Description:**

Hi everyone,

We're scheduling our kickoff meeting to align on objectives and establish our working rhythm for the next 12 weeks.

**Meeting Objectives:**

1. Finalize Sprint 2 objectives (review consensus, address questions)
2. Establish working rhythm (check-in cadence, communication preferences)
3. Map mentor expertise to objectives (how we can best leverage your experience)
4. **Identify relevant relationships we can leverage (oil sands operators, engineering firms, regulatory contacts, funding sources)**
5. Prioritize first 4 weeks (what needs to happen now to set up success)
6. AER engagement strategy (initial game plan per Patrick's guidance)

**Format:** 60-90 minutes (in-person at Haskayne or virtual - we'll confirm based on preferences)

We'll follow up with confirmed details and a brief pre-read document.
