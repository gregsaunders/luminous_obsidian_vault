## Draft Response (Tight, Real, Appreciative, Not Kiss-Ass)

**Subject:** Re: Luminous Sprint 2 Objectives - Adjusted

Jocelyn, Doug, Terence, team,

Thanks for the feedback - several good catches here. Adjustments below.

---

**OBJECTIVE 1 (Pilot Program):** Secure one paid pilot agreement signed (CNRL, Suncor, or Imperial) for Q2 2026 deployment, AND advance discussions with 2 additional operators to build pipeline.

**Rationale:** Agreed on crawl-walk-run. First deployment will teach us what operators actually need. Goal is they like it so much it never leaves - if the pilot ends and they don't want to keep it, we've failed to prove value. Building multi-operator pipeline gives us better learning and de-risks single-customer dependency.

---

**OBJECTIVE 2 (Fundraising Readiness):** Finalize 24-month pro-forma budget with mentor validation (Weeks 1-4 priority), and secure ~$250K in non-dilutive matching funds to support ~$1.5M pre-seed round.

**Rationale:** You're right that stating $1.5M without finalized budget was premature. Budget work happens Weeks 1-4, THEN we'll know if $1.5M is correct or we need to adjust. This is now a top priority alongside pilot advancement - can't raise without credible budget + pilot traction.

---

**OBJECTIVE 3 (Deployment Playbook):** Develop operational deployment playbook validated by mentors, covering integration workflows (SCADA/LIMS/GIS), field support protocols, data systems architecture, and pilot success metrics.

 

**Rationale:** Agreed that post-pilot messaging refinement is premature. This shifts focus to HOW we execute pilots successfully - repeatable process for Pilot 1, 2, 3. We'll learn what operators value during deployment, but we need execution framework to deliver well.

---

**Doug's MTA offer:** Agreed - will engage when we reach agreement stage with CNRL (likely Weeks 5-8). I've negotiated O&G agreements before, but your experience with predatory IP terms would be valuable.

 

**Slack transition:** Agreed. Propose single **#luminous-sprint2** channel for all discussions unless you prefer separate channels by objective. What's CDL standard?

---

These adjusted objectives work for Nov 21 Slack post? Happy to iterate further, but most details can wait for Nov 27 kickoff (9:30 AM).
