**Subject:** CDL Rockies update + partnership opportunity

 

Hey Yves,

 

Apologies for the radio silence since our call—I've been heads-down getting our customer-facing materials properly aligned. But a lot has happened on our end, and I wanted to reconnect.

 

**Big news: We were accepted into Creative Destruction Lab's energy cohort.** Cohort work starts next week. I noticed Monique Simair is one of the CDL mentors—given Maven's recent partnership with Integrated Sustainability, I'm hoping we get a chance to connect with her during the program.

 

**Quick context on what's changed since we last spoke:**

 

**1. Field Validation Complete**  
Head-to-head biosensor vs. HRMS trials at Imperial's Kearl wetland pilot showed strong correlation in real operational conditions. Peer-reviewed papers publishing by year-end.

 

**2. OSMWSC Regulatory Alignment**  
September 2025 OSMWSC recommendations explicitly call for operational monitoring on treatment pilots and technology transparency with Indigenous communities—basically describing exactly what we've built.

 

**3. Release Timeline Creates Urgency**  
Alberta's 12-18 month commitment to establish tailings water release standards means operators need monitoring capabilities in place before those standards finalize.

 

**4. Confluent Platform**  
We've moved beyond just sensors to an integrated intelligence platform—AI-native data system that transforms monitoring into operational insights and multi-stakeholder transparency dashboards.

 

**Why this fits Integrated Sustainability:** You're already embedded in operators' treatment programs and water management projects. We're not competing with engineering services—we're the monitoring intelligence layer that makes those programs auditable, optimizable, and transparent to regulators and communities.

 

Our Confluent platform integrates with existing SCADA systems, LIMS, and historical data (including all those PDF reports), turning fragmented information into queryable operational intelligence.

 

**I've cleaned up our documentation** if you want context for internal discussions:

- [Executive Brief](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQKcM7m2oXzqYAOfUiVIZaihj8ZijegyimQm1sUEahPaau0byNRbq7dd8tGC1pFKs9Ca-dKNAXKlIqE/pub) - Business case and market timing (5 pages, good for decision-makers)
- [Solution Overview](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vRcnv4qlwnOsNHeqExymxMLInlmVhpRSHI1e9pCMDbfNzpJE0EEciIoxfT9QDg_vj-5KFSYXNgnFvvj/pub) - Technical approach and three-tier strategy (4 pages, good for technical teams)

**No rush—week after next works better anyway.** But if you see a fit with Integrated Sustainability's treatment and water management portfolio, I'd appreciate the opportunity to reconnect when timing makes sense.

 

Thanks for being a sounding board on this.

 

Cheers,  
Jeff
