## 👋 Welcome & Introduction (15 Minutes)

The goal here is to establish a **friendly, collaborative tone** and acknowledge Max's unique value.

- **Icebreaker (5 min):** Start with casual small talk (e.g., "How's the MBA program going?", "How was the CDL selection process?"). Ask Jeff to share a **brief, personal highlight** from his background (e.g., the competitive nature of being a former athlete).
    
- **Max’s Story & Kearl Connection (10 min):** Ask Max to share his journey and what he learned during his time at the **Kearl site (2013-2014)**.
    
    - _Prompt:_ "We know you were at Kearl. That site is where we validated our biosensor. We'd love to hear your perspective on the **operational context**—what were the big challenges with tailings and water back then?"
        
    - _Goal:_ Confirm his operational knowledge and make him feel valued for his specific site experience, which directly feeds **Project 1 (Economics)**.

## 💡 Luminous Story & Strategy Alignment (15 Minutes)

The goal is to provide Max with the **aligned strategic context** and introduce the **Trojan Horse** strategy (without the buzzwords).

- **Our Pivot (5 min):** Jeff, share the Luminous story briefly. Emphasize that you've moved past selling a sensor to selling **Readiness Infrastructure**.
    
    - _Key Message:_ "We validated **$260K of operational savings** at Kearl (the 'Wedge'). Now, we're building the strategic asset that uses that ROI to justify securing a **12-month head start on 2027 regulatory compliance** (the 'Driver')."
        
- **The Big Questions (10 min):** Introduce the three core unknowns that Max is here to solve, linking them back to his skills.
    
    - _Economics (G4):_ "We know the operational value is $260K, but Max, your data background is needed to tell us if that's **meaningful** or **trivial** in the context of a VP of Operations' $500M budget."
        
    - _Regulation (G8):_ "Your policy background is critical here. **Patrick Elliott** (our mentor) needs to know who at the **AER** we should be talking to right now."
        
    - _Authority (G3):_ "We need your help figuring out where the budget for **'Readiness Infrastructure'** resides. Is it OPEX or CAPEX, and who signs off?"

## 🎯 Project Alignment & Next Steps (30 Minutes)

The final section shifts to business, confirming Max understands the deliverables and setting him up for Week 1 success.

- **Review Project Brief (10 min):** Briefly walk through the **Executive Summary** and **Expected Deliverables** in the `mba-student-project-brief.md` file. Ask Max: "Based on your background, which of these three projects (**G4 Economics, G3 Authority, G8 AER Strategy**) are you most excited to start on?"
    
    - _Note:_ Confirm Max has read the brief and the key files (Sprint 2/4).
        
- **Week 1 Deliverables (15 min):** Define the immediate, non-intimidating tasks for Max:
    
    - **Phase 1: Research Sources:** Identify key public filing data (SEDAR) and reports for Project 1 (G4).
        
    - **Phase 2: Discovery Prep:** Draft an initial list of **discovery questions** for the CNRL contacts (G3) to validate the budget authority hypothesis.
        
    - **Schedule:** Confirm a **1-hour check-in** for the following week.
        
- **Q&A and Mentor Leverage (5 min):** Open the floor for any questions Max has. Offer immediate access to the **CDL mentor network** for context validation (e.g., offer to facilitate an email introduction to **Jocelyn McMinn** for initial G3 insights).
