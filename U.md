Dear Ms. Ostwald,

I am writing in response to the application from Hasna Shireen, on behalf of Ms. Jolie, dated November 4, 2025.

I strongly refute the inflammatory and baseless allegations of "fraudulent non-disclosure" and "perjury." These claims are factually incorrect and are contradicted by the attachments Ms. Shireen herself has provided, as well as by your own Final Award.

This application is an attempt to re-litigate matters that were fully disclosed, considered, and **finally adjudicated** by you in 2021.

 1. **The Allegation of 2020 Income Misrepresentation is False** - The central claim that I misrepresented my 2020 income is false. This information was fully disclosed and was a key point of discussion during the arbitration.

	- Your Award of May 14, 2021, **explicitly addresses this**. In **Paragraph 70**, you wrote: "I accept Jeff's evidence that his estimated 2020 income was $96,000.00. I further accept that Jeff has no employment income on an ongoing basis at this time and ongoing EI/CERB payments are uncertain and unreliable."
    
	- The 2020 Notice of Reassessment for $125,461, which counsel presents as new evidence, is not. It reflects my employment income from early 2020 (a fact disclosed at the time) and subsequent EI/CERB payments. Your ruling in Paragraph 70 confirms you were aware of this and made a final determination on it.
    
	- The BC court transcript (Attachment E) does not prove perjury; it proves my consistency. In it, I state: "I made $125,000 in 2020. But that's because I had some employment, but I was unemployed at the end of 2020...". This is a truthful statement of the exact facts that were before you.
    
	There is no "new and material evidence" here. There is only a new lawyer re-arguing old facts that were already decided.

2. **The Allegation of Corporate Concealment is False.**

	The claim of a "concealed" personal income of "$200,000 - $300,000" is a complete fabrication, which counsel herself admits is "anticipated" and "estimated."

	- My work as an independent contractor through my corporation, JiVE Solutions Inc., is a standard, legal business practice and was fully disclosed.
    
	- Your awareness of United Petroleum Sales is a matter of record, as seen in **Paragraph 15 of the Child Support Order** (cited in your Award), which dealt specifically with income from one of my companies.
    
	- JiVE was formed for a new contracts I needed to bill the companies for.  The other entities are non-revenue-generating startups, as my public LinkedIn profile clearly indicates.
    
	- Ms. Jolie has previously received my personal tax returns and the financial statements for JiVE Solutions, which fully disclose all corporate revenue and my personal income.
    
3. **Ms. Shireen's Letter Confirms My Child Support Obligation Has Ended.**

	I wish to draw your attention to a critical admission in Ms. Shireen's letter which resolves any question about current child support.

	**Counsel states:**

> 	"Dominic has now graduated from his undergraduate degree... Beckham graduated in June and is still determining his post-secondary path."

This is a formal admission that neither adult child is currently enrolled in full-time post-secondary education.

As per **Paragraph 5 of the Child Support Order** (which your Award upholds), the condition for paying Section 3 child support to Ms. Jolie is that the child is "enrolled as a full-time student and in good standing".

By counsel's own admission, this condition is not met for either Dominic or Beckham. Therefore, my child support obligation to Ms. Jolie has legally concluded. The support I paid from June to November 2025 for Beckham was an overpayment, made in good faith while awaiting proof of enrolment that never came.

**Conclusion and Request**

This application is the latest in a series of vexatious actions, including attempts to circumvent our binding agreement in the BC and Alberta courts. This constitutes administrative abuse.

The request to reopen a final Award based on old, adjudicated facts is frivolous. The request for me to bear all costs, while Ms. Jolie pays nothing, is improper.

I respectfully request that this application be **dismissed immediately**.

I am not providing further financial disclosure at this time, as I am not required to respond to a baseless application. However, should you determine that this application has merit and you require a formal review, I am fully prepared to provide complete financial disclosure.

At that point, I will be retaining legal counsel and will require that Ms. Jolie post a substantial retainer to cover your fees and my anticipated legal costs. If this frivolous application is allowed to proceed, I will be seeking full solicitor-client costs against Ms. Jolie.

I trust this response clarifies the facts and demonstrates that these serious allegations are without merit.

Respectfully,

Jeff Violo
