Often, they use Material Transfer Agreements, an even more general operational document with some crafty terms in them.

HI all

MTA = Master Terms Agreement lol. I've not heard that one before (more familiar with MSA). Good point by Mr. Beach

**For Objective 1** - IMO lets walk before we run, I also think its more valuable to get pilots with multiple operators than a subscription with one. Your first deployment will also be full of pitfalls and "unknown unknowns"

**Objective 2** - your messaging will change as you go through these pilots, you will learn what benefits the operators value in your solution. Too early to do this. I'd rather see Objective 2 relate to the deployment plan/playbook. Thoughts all?

**Objective 3** - looks good but how do you know you need 1.5mm if you havent actually done the budget? or is it done and you just need to finalize it

I am happy to have you guys reply on slack as email chains suck.

thx

One or more of the MTAs from one or more of the companies mentioned used to have terms that I considered rather predatory. In those versions it provided them rights of use of the technologies for themselves, and access to information that could undermine defenses of IP. The MTA authors were unwilling to edit the MTA. I helped at least one company develop workarounds that enabled the MTA providing company to confirm the working of the tech while still shielding the IP.

If you would like me to review and comment on documents like this, let me know. I'm not a lawyer, but I've read and negotiated a lot of documents. This is a key reason I raised my hand.

Hi Jeff,

For Objective 1, would "with a goal to convert to an annual monitoring contract." be measurable?

For Objective 2, it seems like you are looking to develop use cases with quantified benefits to better articulate your value proposition. Would a measurable outcome be a Go to Market plan?

**Subject:** Luminous Sprint 2 Objectives - Request for Feedback by Nov 21

Hi Jocelyn (and team),

Thank you all for the great feedback during Session 1, the guidance helped us refocus how we're thinking about the next 12 weeks.

We've refined our Sprint 2 objectives based on your insights and would love to get your consensus before we post them to the CDL Slack channel on November 21.

### Proposed Sprint 2 Objectives:

**OBJECTIVE 1 (Pilot):** Secure one paid pilot with a major oil sands operator (CNRL, Suncor, or Imperial) for deployment in Q2 2026, with a goal to convert to an annual monitoring contract.

**OBJECTIVE 2 (Messaging):** Develop an operational execution strategy and "playbook" that reframes our solution as an "Operational Intelligence Platform," proving it can save significant operational costs in near-real-time.

**OBJECTIVE 3 (Capital):** Finalize a 24-month pro-forma budget and technical-commercial roadmap to support a ~$1.5M pre-seed round, and secure ~$250K in non-dilutive matching funds.

### MBA Student Pairing:

We're excited to be paired with Max Zhang (Haskayne MBA) - https://www.linkedin.com/in/maxzhang1706/, who has Kearl oil sands project experience and energy/environmental law background. We'll include him in all mentor calls.

### Questions for the team:

- Does this capture the right focus for Sprint 2?
- Any red flags or missing elements we should address?
- Are these objectives measurable enough for Session 2 evaluation?
- How can we best leverage each mentor's expertise across these objectives?

We'd appreciate any feedback by Thursday, November 21 so we can finalize and post to the CDL channel on schedule.

I'm also working on a Doodle poll for our full mentor team kickoff meeting (likely targeting early late November or December to respect everyone's schedules).

Thanks again for your support!

Jeff

## Key Feedback Summary

### Objective 1 (Pilot)

- **Jocelyn:** Focus on multiple pilot operators rather than converting one to subscription. First deployment will have many unknowns.
- **Terence:** Questions whether "with a goal to convert to an annual monitoring contract" is measurable.

### Objective 2 (Messaging)

- **Jocelyn:** Too early - messaging will change during pilots as you learn what operators actually value. Should focus on deployment plan/playbook instead.
- **Terence:** Suggests measurable outcome should be a Go to Market plan.

### Objective 3 (Capital)

- **Jocelyn:** Looks good, but questions how you know $1.5M is needed if budget isn't finalized yet.

### Other Notes

- **Douglas Beach:** Offers to review MTAs/agreements - has experience identifying predatory terms that could undermine IP protection.
- **Jocelyn:** Prefers Slack over email chains for future communications.
