**Subject:** CDL Rockies intro - Luminous BioSolutions (NA monitoring + AI platform)

 

Hi Monique,

 

I'm Jeff Violo, co-founder of Luminous BioSolutions. We were accepted into CDL Rockies' energy cohort starting next week, and I saw you're one of the mentors which has me pretty excited given your expertise in water treatment for mining and your work with Maven (and now Integrated Sustainability).

 

**Quick context on Luminous:**  
We've developed an integrated NA monitoring platform for oil sands tailings management, 24-hour biosensor screening results plus an AI-native data intelligence platform (Confluent) that transforms monitoring data into operational insights and multi-stakeholder transparency.

 

**Why I think this might interest you:**

- Our Kearl field validation just wrapped (head-to-head biosensor vs. HRMS, strong correlation)
- OSMWSC September recommendations align perfectly with what we've built (operational monitoring + stakeholder transparency)
- We're addressing both the technical bottleneck (HRMS delays) and the trust gap (communities demanding verifiable data)
- Confluent's approach to integrating structured + unstructured data (PDFs, spreadsheets, historical reports) into queryable intelligence might align with Integrated Sustainability's treatment strategy work

**Would you have any interest meeting us nets week at the event?** I'd value your perspective on water treatment integration and how monitoring intelligence fits into operators' treatment programs.

 

I'm happy to connect beforehand if you'd like more context. I can share our Executive Brief and Solution Overview.

 

Thanks for considering this, Monique.

 

Best regards,  
Jeff Violo
