1. Confirm that the biosensors have strong IP protection.  

2. Highlight unique features (e.g., high sensitivity, cost-efficiency, specificity of NA detection) that distinguish the product from competitors.

3. Future work is using the NA biosensor to identify bacterial isolates from tailings ponds that are capable of degrading NA. This can be used to identify and simple bacterial community of bacteria that can be grown and prepared like 'probiotics', for use during constructed wetland treatment, in a 'bioaugmentation' approach.
