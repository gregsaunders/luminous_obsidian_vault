## ANNOUNCING UP TO $65 MILLION FOR 2025 INDUSTRIAL TRANSFORMATION CHALLENGE TO INCREASE ALBERTA’S GLOBAL COMPETITIVENESS
Alberta’s emissions-intensive, trade-exposed industries face challenges to reducing emissions while improving operational efficiencies and increasing global competitiveness amidst geopolitical changes. ERA’s Industrial Transformation Challenge is an annual funding competition designed to improve the economic competitiveness and environmental sustainability of Alberta’s industrial and natural resource sectors. 

The 2025 Industrial Transformation Challenge provides up to $65 million towards technology scale-up, pilot demonstration, and first-of-kind projects that present transformative solutions for Alberta’s industrial landscape.

New for this year, projects and technologies with environmental benefits beyond emissions reduction are invited to apply, including improved water management, soil remediation, reduced land use or disturbance, and the reduction of air pollutants.

Successful applicants are eligible for up to $10 million per project; exceptionally strong projects with a high funding leverage ratio may be eligible up to $15 million on a limited basis. The minimum request is $500,000. The maximum ERA contribution to a single project will be no more than 50 per cent of the project’s eligible expenses.
#### WHO SHOULD APPLY
Innovators, technology developers, industrial facility owners and operators, industrial associations, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), research and development organizations, universities, not-for-profit organizations, government research labs, and individuals are invited to apply. While technology solutions can originate from anywhere globally, they should be piloted, demonstrated, or deployed in Alberta or show direct economic benefit to the province.
#### PARTNERSHIPS
Partnerships are encouraged. Consortiums help attract and retain highly skilled workers, increase Alberta’s innovation capacity, engage local communities, and leverage complementary resources. Applicants are encouraged to partner with Alberta’s post-secondary and research institutions, Indigenous communities, co-operative organizations, and municipalities where they can.

#### ELIGIBLE TECHNOLOGIES
The Industrial Transformation Challenge is not limited to any particular focus area or technology; however, ERA is seeking high-quality projects in areas of high strategic interest or where known technology gaps exist.
#### Eligible Technology category we play in:

- Environmental remediation and sustainability
    - Novel solutions for soil remediation and land reclamation
    - Novel solutions for water treatment and/or reduced water withdrawals
    - Novel solutions for mitigating or eliminating air pollutants (incl. NOx, SOx, Ozone, Volatile Organic Compounds, etc.)

#### PROJECT DEVELOPMENT STAGE

Expressions of Interest (EOIs) are invited for projects that will advance technology to the stages of field pilot, demonstration, or first-of-kind commercial implementation by project completion, as described below:

- _**Field Test/Pilot:**_ At this stage, the solution is ready to be field tested in an operational environment. Projects in this category include the scale-up of prototypes to representative pilot scale and subsequent in-field testing of pilot units.
- **_Demonstration_:** At this stage of development, technology or innovation is approaching the final commercial product, and representative systems have been built. Projects in this category include demonstration of near- or full-commercial-scale systems in an operational environment.
- _**First-of-Kind Implementation:**_ At this stage, the technology is ready for first-of-kind commercial deployment. Projects in this category involve design, construction, and operation of the technology in its final commercial form, with the intent to operate the technology for its full commercial life.

#### APPROVAL PROCESS
Submissions will be selected through ERA’s competitive review process. A team of experts in science, engineering, business development, commercialization, financing, and GHG quantification will conduct an independent, rigorous, transparent review overseen by a Fairness Monitor. Projects will be approved by [ERA’s Board of Directors](https://www.eralberta.ca/about-era/the-board/)

#### ABOUT EMISSIONS REDUCTION ALBERTA (ERA): 
For 16 years, ERA has invested revenues from the carbon price paid by large emitters to accelerate the development and adoption of innovative clean technology solutions. Since its establishment in 2009, ERA has committed $970 million toward 306 projects valued at over $7.3 billion, which are helping to reduce emissions, create competitive industries, and lead to new business opportunities in Alberta. These projects are estimated to deliver cumulative reductions of 34 million tonnes of CO₂e by 2030 and 95 million tonnes of CO₂e by 2050. 
#### ABOUT TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION AND EMISSIONS REDUCTION REGULATION
The [Technology Innovation and Emissions Reduction (TIER) Regulation](https://www.alberta.ca/technology-innovation-and-emissions-reduction-regulation) is at the core of emissions management in Alberta. The TIER system implements Alberta’s industrial carbon pricing and emissions trading system. TIER helps industrial facilities find innovative ways to reduce emissions and invest in clean technology to stay competitive and save money.
