## ANNOUNCING UP TO $65 MILLION FOR 2025 INDUSTRIAL TRANSFORMATION CHALLENGE TO INCREASE ALBERTA’S GLOBAL COMPETITIVENESS
Alberta’s emissions-intensive, trade-exposed industries face challenges to reducing emissions while improving operational efficiencies and increasing global competitiveness amidst geopolitical changes. ERA’s Industrial Transformation Challenge is an annual funding competition designed to improve the economic competitiveness and environmental sustainability of Alberta’s industrial and natural resource sectors. 

The 2025 Industrial Transformation Challenge provides up to $65 million towards technology scale-up, pilot demonstration, and first-of-kind projects that present transformative solutions for Alberta’s industrial landscape.

New for this year, projects and technologies with environmental benefits beyond emissions reduction are invited to apply, including improved water management, soil remediation, reduced land use or disturbance, and the reduction of air pollutants.

Successful applicants are eligible for up to $10 million per project; exceptionally strong projects with a high funding leverage ratio may be eligible up to $15 million on a limited basis. The minimum request is $500,000. The maximum ERA contribution to a single project will be no more than 50 per cent of the project’s eligible expenses.

The application deadline is **Thursday, June 12, 5 p.m. MDT (UTC-6h)**. Late submissions will not be accepted. An hour-long online webinar was held on Tuesday, April 29, at 11 a.m. MDT (UTC-6h).

Successful applicants are eligible for up to $10 million per project; exceptionally strong projects with a high funding leverage ratio may be eligible up to $15 million on a limited basis. The minimum request is $500,000. The maximum ERA contribution to a single project will be no more than 50 per cent of the project’s eligible expenses. 
#### Eligible Technology category we play in :

- Environmental remediation and sustainability
    - Novel solutions for soil remediation and land reclamation
    - Novel solutions for water treatment and/or reduced water withdrawals
    - Novel solutions for mitigating or eliminating air pollutants (incl. NOx, SOx, Ozone, Volatile Organic Compounds, etc.)
#### PROJECT DEVELOPMENT STAGE

Expressions of Interest (EOIs) are invited for projects that will advance technology to the stages of field pilot, demonstration, or first-of-kind commercial implementation by project completion, as described below:

- _**Field Test/Pilot:**_ At this stage, the solution is ready to be field tested in an operational environment. Projects in this category include the scale-up of prototypes to representative pilot scale and subsequent in-field testing of pilot units.
- **_Demonstration_:** At this stage of development, technology or innovation is approaching the final commercial product, and representative systems have been built. Projects in this category include demonstration of near- or full-commercial-scale systems in an operational environment.
- _**First-of-Kind Implementation:**_ At this stage, the technology is ready for first-of-kind commercial deployment. Projects in this category involve design, construction, and operation of the technology in its final commercial form, with the intent to operate the technology for its full commercial life.
#### APPROVAL PROCESS

Submissions will be selected through ERA’s competitive review process. A team of experts in science, engineering, business development, commercialization, financing, and GHG quantification will conduct an independent, rigorous, transparent review overseen by a Fairness Monitor. Projects will be approved by [ERA’s Board of Directors](https://www.eralberta.ca/about-era/the-board/)
