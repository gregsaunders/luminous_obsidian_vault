### 1. Technology Opportunity
- Provide a description of the proposed solution (e.g. technology, practice, etc.) to be demonstrated in the project and how it works, using diagrams and photographs as appropriate.

- Provide a clear process flow diagram to demonstrate the full scope of how the solution functions and what inputs it requires, including mass and energy balances and product/material specifications as necessary.

- Describe what problem the technology solves and how it addresses a market need. Clearly justify how the proposed solution represents a potentially transformative improvement compared with current practice.

- Identify competitors or alternatives to the proposed solution and compare them to the chosen approach.

- Discuss the aspects of the solution that make it novel and innovative and how they will contribute to a sustainable competitive advantage.

- Describe the current status of the innovation (i.e. stage of development/commercialization) and how it will be advanced through the proposed project. Clearly outline how ERA investment in the project will accelerate the solution toward commercialization (i.e.: what risks and challenges will be resolved and how?).


### 2. Implementation Plan

- Provide a description of the overall objectives, work scope, and deliverables for the proposed project.

- Clearly describe the nature of the prototype, pilot, demonstration, or first-of-kind deployment proposed, including the size/scale and the relevance to the anticipated fully commercial system (e.g. 1:10 commercial scale).

- List the specific location(s) of project activities.

- **Provide an overview of the project work plan, indicating major project milestones and anticipated timeline for completion of each milestone. Please fill in and follow the Milestone Summary Table template at the end of this document. This table does not form part of the 10-page limit and may be attached separately.**

- Provide a summary budget for the proposed project according to the milestones in the work plan. Clearly identify the total budget for the project.

- List the organization(s) involved in the project consortium, their roles, status (confirmed, in discussion, etc.) and the overall project execution structure.

- Identify the core team members who will carry out and/or support the project and outline their relevant expertise and experience, including those within the applicant organization and partnering organizations.

- Using the table below, identify all confirmed and anticipated financial contributors to the project, including the funding amount and the current status for each source. Add or subtract rows as necessary.

- Describe the overall plan for financing the project and the estimated timelines for securing funds. Please ensure that this description aligns with the sources of funding listed in the Grant Manager

- Summarize the line of sight from the current status to the beginning of major project activities, including any required internal approvals, budgeting, site selection, agreements, permitting, studies, and similar factors.

- Provide a brief overview of the key risks that could result in delay or failure of the project, and the plan for risk mitigation.

- Explain why ERA funding is being requested. Describe what risks and/or barriers ERA funding mitigates and justify the funding amount requested from ERA.

### 3. **1.**  GHG Benefits**

- Describe how the proposed solution results in direct or indirect greenhouse gas (GHG) benefits, including GHG reductions, displacement of higher-GHG products, GHG removals, carbon sequestration, or carbon sink enhancement. Please also describe how the proposed solution may contribute to any enabled GHG reductions.

- Provide a quantitative estimate of the annual GHG reductions in Alberta that would result directly from the proposed project (i.e. not after subsequent market adoption or further commercialization activities) on an annual and cumulative basis.

- Estimate the annual GHG reduction potential that could be achieved by market implementation of the solution by 2030 and 2050, and indicate any assumptions made for market penetration rate. Indicate what portion of market GHG benefits are expected within Alberta.

·  Discuss how the solution may contribute to achieving net-zero GHG emissions in the sector(s) to which it applies. In particular, highlight the planned or expected role of the solution in corporate net-zero plans/commitments.
