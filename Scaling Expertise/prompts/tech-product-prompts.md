--- tags: [prompts, tech, engineering, product] created: 2025-10-19 --- # Tech &amp Product Prompts These prompts help technical professionals scale their expertise by removing documentation bottlenecks. ## Senior Software Engineer - RFC Document **Use case:** Technical design documents for both engineers and product leadership. ```markdown I'm a principal engineer writing an RFC. Audience is engineering team and product leadership. Problem Statement: [What's broken or limiting us now] Current System: [How things work today and why it's a problem] Proposed Solution: [Your technical approach] Tradeoffs: [What we gain, what we sacrifice, alternatives considered] Implementation Plan: [Migration approach, timeline, risks] Write this with technical depth but make the executive summary accessible to non-engineers. Tone: technical but clear, balanced on tradeoffs. Structure: problem, current state, proposal, tradeoffs, implementation, success metrics. Constraints: Do not over-specify. Include detail mentioned here but do not infer additional technical detail not represented. ``` **What you own:** Architecture choices, tradeoff analysis, technical judgment, system design **What AI handles:** Structuring argument, translating for mixed audiences, document format --- ## Vibe Coder - Technical Spec **Use case:** Fast-moving projects needing quick specs without heavy process. ```markdown I'm a developer writing a technical spec for a feature or project. This is for the engineering team and needs to balance speed with clarity. Project/Feature: [What you're building] The Vibe: [The overall approach/philosophy - quick MVP, experimental, production-ready, etc.] Technical Approach: [Stack, key libraries, architecture decisions, why this approach] What We're NOT Doing: [Scope boundaries, what's out of scope for now] Key Decisions &amp Tradeoffs: [Important choices you made and why, what you're optimizing for] Open Questions: [What you're still figuring out or need input on] Write this conversationally but with enough technical detail that someone can implement it. Focus on the &quotwhy&quot behind decisions. Tone: casual but technical, pragmatic, collaborative. Structure: context, approach, key decisions, open questions, next steps. ``` **What you own:** Technical decisions, tradeoff reasoning, implementation approach **What AI handles:** Organizing thoughts, consistent format, readable structure --- ## Product Manager - PRD **Use case:** Product requirements that align engineering, design, and leadership. ```markdown I'm a product manager writing a PRD for a new feature or product. Audience is engineering, design, and leadership. Problem Statement: [What user problem are we solving, why does it matter] Success Metrics: [How we'll measure if this worked] User Stories: [Key use cases and user flows] Requirements: [Must-haves, should-haves, nice-to-haves] Technical Considerations: [Known constraints, dependencies, integrations] Open Questions: [What we still need to figure out] Timeline &amp Scope: [Launch target, phasing if applicable] Write this to align the team around the &quotwhy&quot and &quotwhat&quot while leaving room for engineering to solve the &quothow.&quot Tone: clear, user-focused, collaborative. Structure: problem, success metrics, requirements, considerations, timeline. ``` **What you own:** Product strategy, user insights, success criteria, prioritization **What AI handles:** Document structure, requirement formatting, stakeholder alignment --- ## Engineer - Technical Design Doc **Use case:** Detailed technical planning for significant projects. ```markdown I'm a software engineer writing a design doc for a significant technical project. Audience is the engineering team and tech leads. Problem: [What we're solving, why current approach doesn't work] Proposed Solution: [Your technical design at a high level] Architecture: [System components, data flow, key technologies] Alternatives Considered: [Other approaches and why you didn't choose them] Migration/Implementation Plan: [How we roll this out, phases, risk mitigation] Testing Strategy: [How we validate this works] Success Criteria: [How we know this solved the problem] Write with enough technical depth for engineers to evaluate the approach. Be clear about tradeoffs. Tone: technical, thorough, balanced on tradeoffs. Structure: problem, solution, architecture, alternatives, implementation, testing, success criteria. ``` **What you own:** Technical design, architecture decisions, risk assessment **What AI handles:** Document organization, clear technical writing, consistent structure --- ## CTO - Engineering Strategy Memo **Use case:** Strategic engineering decisions needing executive buy-in. ```markdown I'm a CTO writing a strategic memo. Audience is engineering leadership and executive team. Context: [Current state - what's working, what's not, where we are as an org] Strategic Goal: [What we need to accomplish and why it matters for the business] Technical Vision: [Where we're taking the architecture/platform/stack] Organizational Changes: [Team structure, hiring plan, process improvements] Investment Required: [Time, headcount, tools, tradeoffs with feature work] Timeline &amp Milestones: [Key checkpoints, how we'll measure progress] Risks: [What could go wrong, mitigation strategies] Connect technical decisions to business outcomes. Make the case for why this investment matters. Tone: strategic, business-aware, decisive. Structure: context, goal, vision, org plan, investment, timeline, risks. ``` **What you own:** Technical strategy, business alignment, organizational decisions **What AI handles:** Executive communication, business case structure, stakeholder framing
