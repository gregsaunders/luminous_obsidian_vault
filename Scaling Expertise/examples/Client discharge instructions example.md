# **OFFICE VISIT SUMMARY**

**Date:** 09-17-2025

**Client Name:** Nicole Searth         

**Patient Name:** Stripe

## **REASON FOR VISIT / DIAGNOSIS**

Sedated Ear Examination and Treatment

## **SUMMARY OF DIAGNOSTICS / TREATMENT RECOMMENDATIONS**

Stripe did well for her procedure today.  She was administered a general anesthetic with intubation.   
Next, the left ear was examined and found to be normal.  A microscopic exam of the ear discharge was all normal (no yeast or bacteria).  
Her right ear was then examined with the video otoscope.  The ear flap and opening of the canal was found to be severely scarred and thickened thus narrowing the opening of the ear. Multiple cysts were present at the opening of the canal as well. The canal was relatively clear however the ear drum was diseased and ruptured from chronic infection. The bulla (middle ear), which is normally air-filled, was plugged with thick waxy discharge. The bulla was then flushed extensively and gently with warmed saline to get as much of the discharge out as possible.  Cytology of the bulla discharge showed low numbers of bacteria with some yeast present.  The bulla was then again flushed/suctioned multiple times with warmed saline until it was clear and an antibiotic/steroid solution was deposited directly into the bulla.  The cysts that were blocking the ear canal opening were surgically removed to open up the ear canal as much as possible.  
DIAGNOSIS:   Ceruminous Cystomatosis and chronic otitis media (middle ear infection)  
As previously discussed at Stripe's consult, middle ear disease can be very frustrating and difficult to treat. Unlike dogs, the cat's bulla is divided into 2 parts by a septum making it possible to only flush out one compartment. Treatment of the other compartment relies on oral medications. She will need oral antibiotics for 4-6 weeks and topical medications for an extended period.  Ceruminous cystomatosis also can be frustrating to deal with and is likely the cause of the middle ear infection. There is no cure for this condition and treatment is surgically removing the cysts when they occur. We don't really know what causes this.  The cysts block the ear canal, disabling normal wax clearance, resulting in infection and narrowing of the canal.  Steroids (Prednisolone) are extremely valuable in reducing recurrence of these cysts but they may come back.  We will need to recheck the ears every 2 weeks until the otitis media has resolved and/or until the tympanic membrane heals.  Rechecks are critical if we are to have success in resolving this issue.   The degree of scarring, infection, and ear drum disease is concerning and we are unsure at this time if Stripe's ear drum will grow back. If we are not successful at keeping the ear infection-free and comfortable with this procedure then a more intensive surgery will be required (Ventral Bulla Osteotomy).  
Please monitor for heat tilt, Horner Syndrome, deafness as these are all possible after deep ear flushes. Call the hospital if you notice any of these signs.  
We are sending the cysts away to the lab for identification and should have the results back by the 2 week recheck.  
  
Please book the 2 week recheck and feel free to call if you have any questions or concerns.  Thanks for allowing us to be involved in Stripe's care today!
