Dear Dr Bardock,  
  
Below is the in hospital summary for Stripe Searth seen on 09-17-2025.  
  
Stripe initially presented to Cedarwood Veterinary Hospital August 14/25 for a dermatological exam due to a history of chronic ear disease. Stripe was found to have unilateral (R) ear disease including multiple masses in the ostia, scarring/calcification of pinnal base, otitis externa and potentially otitis media. A plan was made for a full ear assessment using video otoscopy under general anesthetic. The owner declined advanced imaging. A discussion was had with owner re the risks of deep ear cleaning in cats, the requirement for lengthy treatment course (6-8wks) of both topical and systemic medications, and the need for rechecks every 2wks until the ear heals. The owner agreed to book in for the procedure.  
  
September 17/25 Stripe was admitted for GA and full ear assessment with video otoscopy. Multiple ceruminous cysts were present in the ostia, the tympanic membrane was ruptured, and the bulla was filled with thick discharge. Stripe was diagnosed with **Ceruminous Cystomatosis with secondary otitis externa and chronic otitis media (OM) (Malassezia and bacteria)**. Treatment involved surgical removal of the cysts then addressing the OM by flushing/suctioning out the bulla. The masses were submitted for histopathology. Stripe did very well through the procedure and was discharged with oral Prednisolone and Clavamox, as well as topical treatment for both yeast and bacteria.  A two week follow up was scheduled.  
  
Owners were counseled on ceruminous cystomatosis and the difficulty in treating OM. Cysts will likely continue to form over time and surgical removal may be required again in the future. OM treatment requires 6-8wks of oral/topical medications and some form of life long  preventative treatment will likely be necessary (often oral prednisolone). If we are unable to keep Stripe comfortable and her ear infection-free a TECA BO salvage procedure may ultimately be required.   
  
  
Thank you very much for referring Stripe to Cedarwood Veterinary & Animal Emergency Hospital. She is a sweet cat and we hope we can make her comfortable again!  Please do not hesitate to contact me with any questions or concerns regarding Stripe's care, or if you would like to discuss any other case.  
Sincerely,
