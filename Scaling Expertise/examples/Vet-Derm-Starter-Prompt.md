# Veterinary Dermatology Medical Record - Starter Prompt Template

**Status:** DRAFT - Customize after reviewing Tara's sample records

**Purpose:** Generate dermatology case medical records for EzyVet in Tara's style

## PROMPT TEMPLATE (Customize After Getting Samples)

```markdown
I'm a board-certified veterinary dermatologist in Alberta, Canada, documenting a dermatology case for the medical record.

**Audience:** Other veterinarians (referring vets, future care providers)

**Goal:** Create a concise, professional medical record that documents my findings, diagnosis, treatment plan, and follow-up. Other vets need to understand what I did and why.

**Tone:** Professional, clinical, technically accurate. Use veterinary terminology appropriately.

**Format:** [TO BE DETERMINED - will match Tara's EzyVet format after reviewing samples]
Options could be:
- SOAP format (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan)
- Problem-oriented format
- Chronological narrative
- Custom clinic format

## EXAMPLE OUTPUT (Will be replaced with Tara's actual style)

**[PLACEHOLDER - Will use one of Tara's actual records as the example once received]**

Example format (generic veterinary SOAP):

**Subjective:**
Max, 5-year-old M/N Golden Retriever, presented for chronic pruritus and recurrent skin infections. Owner reports year-round itching affecting face, paws, and ventral abdomen. Previously treated with antibiotics with temporary improvement. Currently on flea prevention.

**Objective:**
Dermatologic exam reveals erythema and lichenification of ventral abdomen, axillae, and interdigital spaces. Bilateral otitis externa with erythematous canal. Cytology: cocci and neutrophils consistent with bacterial infection. No ectoparasites on skin scraping.

**Assessment:**
1. Atopic dermatitis (primary)
2. Secondary bacterial pyoderma
3. Secondary bacterial otitis externa

**Plan:**
1. Cephalexin 30 mg/kg PO BID x 3-4 weeks for pyoderma
2. Apoquel 0.4 mg/kg PO BID x 14 days, then SID for itch control
3. Douxo S3 Calm shampoo 2x weekly
4. Posatex otic 4 drops each ear BID x 14 days
5. Discuss allergy testing vs. empirical immunotherapy
6. Recheck in 3-4 weeks to assess response
7. Long-term management will likely require ongoing allergy control

**Prognosis:** Good with consistent management. Atopic dermatitis is a chronic condition requiring lifelong therapy.

- [ ] Option B: Fill out input fields above as bullets
- [ ] Option C: Dictate directly into template fields

**Step 2: Generate draft**
- Paste input into AI (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)
- Run with customized prompt above
- Wait 30-60 seconds for output

**Step 3: Review and edit**
- Check clinical accuracy (diagnosis, treatment)
- Verify dosages for this specific patient's weight
- Add patient-specific nuances
- Fix any errors or omissions
- Target review time: 5-10 minutes

**Step 4: Copy into EzyVet**
- Copy final version
- Paste into appropriate EzyVet field
- Sign record

**Total time: ~10-15 minutes vs. 30-45 minutes writing from scratch**

## NEXT STEPS

1. **Get samples from Tara** (5-10 EzyVet records)
2. **Analyze her style** (structure, tone, length, required elements)
3. **Customize this template** based on analysis
4. **Test with 3 real cases** (not from samples)
5. **Refine based on her edits**
6. **Deploy for all cases**

**Goal:** 80-90% accurate output that she can review/edit in 5-10 minutes instead of writing from scratch in 30-45 minutes.

**Success metric:** She uses it for every case after Week 2.
