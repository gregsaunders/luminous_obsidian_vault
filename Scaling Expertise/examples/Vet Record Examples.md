**Dr. Tara Dixon**  
## **Dermatological Consult**:

_History_:  
History of allergic disease  
Silver lab - acquired from a breeder  
Masses present on right cheek area and right ear flap  
Right ear flap mass seems to be growing quickly over the past 2 weeks  
Losing hair on body and is itchy

_Ears_:  
**AD** 1.5cm diameter inflamed crusted rounded raised mass on distal medial pinna, _Impression Smear: inflammatory cells only, rbcs_. Ostia and canal are clear of discharge, mild erythema, _Cytology: cocci 2-3+_  
**AS** Distal pinna is thickened. Ostia and canal with excess ceruminous discharge, moderate erythema. _Cytology: cocci 3+, rods 3+_

_Integument/Haircoat_: Overall hair is dry and coarse feeling. Partial alopecia over entire trunk, worse on ventrum. Multiple hypopigmentation spots bilateral flanks. _Cytology: cocci 3+_. 1.5cm diameter rasied firm nodular mass on lateral right cheek area.

_Pruritic Score_: Moderate pruritus

_Diet_: Canadian naturals Senior - Whitefish and beef

_DDX_:  
1) +/- Color Dilution Alopecia  
2) Allergic disease (FA? CAD?) with secondary:

- Bilateral OE
- Superficial Pyoderma/Folliculitis
    
    _Plan_:  
    Discussed concern for breed-related follicular disorder contributing to alopecia issue. We know George has moderate allergic disease; discussed FA vs CAD. Told O we need to determine how much of George's skin issues are due to allergic disease vs follicular dysplasia. This is done by working up allergies and resolving secondary infections, then monitoring response. Told O that this is a process to work through and that allergic dz cannot be cured but can only be managed. To diagnosis follicular dysplasias, skin biopsies are required and this can be considered once the secondary infections are treated. Told O that we could not ID the right ear mass as it is so inflamed. Plan to treat with antibiotics then recheck mass. Told O that if mass is growing quickly we may need to remove it sooner rather than later.  
    Treatment Plan:  
    1) Novel protein diet trial x 2 months (Can Nat. Pork?)  
    2) Otic Prep 1ml BID x 16ds AU  
    3) Apoquel 16mg Chewable 1.5 tabs SID x 21ds PO (dose range from 1.5 - 2 tabs SID)  
    4) Douxo Pyo Shampoo 1-2x/wk UDF  
    5) Cephalexin 500mg 2.5 tabs BID x 15ds PO  
    6) Recheck 3 weeks

#### Dermatology Consult

**History**:
4 week recheck post ear flush/mass removals
O says she is doing very well, seems comfortable again
Giving all medications OK now, was struggling at the beginning

**AS**   PInna, ostia and canal (vert/horiz) WNL, minimal ceruminous discharge present. TM translucent; normal
*Cytology(canal):  no orgs

**AD**  Lower half of pinna and ostia are thickened and scarred. No erythema or discharge, cyst removal sites have healed well with no new cysts present. The canal opening is mildly stenotic from scarring but more open than at previous exam; can get otoscope cone into canal. The horizontal canal is clear however TM cannot be visualized as canal is scarred and cannot be straightened enough without sedation.
  *Cytology(canal):*  no orgs, occasional cocci*

**Diagnosis**:   Ceruminous Cystomatosis with secondary OM (AD) with external canal scarring/stenosis

**Plan**:
Told O Stripe's ear has healed very well post sx. There is still lots of scarring/fibrosis and the canal is mildly stenotic but these changes are permanent and cannot be reversed. Our hope is that the canal ostia is now open enough to allow some normal self-cleaning by the ear and facilitate maintenance treatments long term. Can trial Dexamethasone tabs in place of Prednisolone to reduce frequency of tx. Trial Cortavance for long term control of inflammation in right ear
1)  Recheck appt in 3 weeks with rDVM
2)  Medications:
   -  Dexamethasone 4mg  1/4 tab EOD x 3weeks. If ear inflammation well controlled can trial 1/4 tab q3ds long term; recommend recheck 3weeks after decreasing frequency.
   -  Cortavance Solution   0.25ml AD 3x/wk long term (administer with syringe)
   
#### Next note for recheck:

**Reason For Visit**  recheck ears
**Is your pet currently on any medications?**  gabapentin, prednisone, clavamox, and 2 ear meds
**Does your pet have any known allergies we need to be aware of?**  no 
**Are there any additional problems or concerns you would like addressed?**  no
**In the event your pet is kept in hospital with us, what is the best number you can be reached at?**  403-845-8779

##**Dermatological Consult**: Other body systems not examined.

   *History*:  
Recurring ear infections/chronic ear infections ongoing 1/2-1yr. 
Also has scabs on skin; this has improved since O stopped feeding yogurt in the morning, also quit using medicated shampoo 
O reports since eliminating yogurt from diet, Karma's skin, haircoat and odor have significantly improved 
Signs are continuous but better while on medications; O states ear cleaners and ear preventatives helped some  (Avena Sativa cleaner, Mometamax tx, BSHC preventatives), but the medicated shampoo made signs worse (Douxo Seborrhea) 
O typically bathes 1-2x q2months 
Is overweight; O states she is always ready to eat and won't stop unless food is taken from her 
Often has D+/loose stools 
Has excessive amt of ocular discharge 
*O requesting we update vaccines today; due for DHP* 

   *Ears*:  Medial pinnae and ostias lichenified and greasy-feeling,  canals filled with ceruminous discharge bilaterally, chronic pebbling/ceruminous hyperplasia. Hair present in canals bilaterally.
*Cytology(AD): Yeast 2+*
*Cytology(AS): Yeast 3-4+, Cocci 2+, Rods 1+*

   *Integument/Haircoat*:  Overall haircoat a bit thin, dry, brittle. Skin is pigmented so hard to appreciate erythema. Ventrum lichenified and greasy feeling, keratinous discharge and seborrhea. Minimal scale on dorsum but suspect mild comedone syndrome.
*Cytology(belly, legs, skin): yeast 3+, melanin granules TNTC* 
*Cytology(back): keratinocytes TNTC, Cocci 2-3+* 


   *Pruritic Score*:  6-7/10 (aural pruritus, nonpruritic otherwise) 


   *Diet*: Purina Lamb and rice Kibble (2-3yrs) 
Suspect adverse rxtn to dairy
Previously fed venison, beef, lamb proteins. Hasn't had much/if any pork or fish. Never had chicken protein d/t other dog having sensitivity to it. 


   *Diagnosis*:    Chronic allergic disease with secondary:
     -  


   *Plan*: Discussed chronic/recurring ear infections and explained how there is always an underlying cause. Explained the importance of treating infection and then using long term preventative topical medications. Discussed allergies and common causes (Over exposure to things in environment/diet). Explained that there is no test for FA, and FA is diagnosed by novel protein diet trial x 2 months then challenging with previous diet or individual ingredients.  Recommended vet prescription diet, Canadian Naturals OTC, or homecooked diet with Pork or Fish protein. - O uninterested in food trial at this time. May reconsider at a later date. Discussed antipruritic options (Apoquel, Cytopoint, Atopica, Zenrelia) and steroids, discussed the short and long term side effects of steroids. Discussed allergy testing + immunotherapy.  Recommended BW to ensure there is no other underlying cause of skin issues (endocrine dz or allergic dz most likely culprits).

1) DHP (SQ:LH)
2) Strongid-T PO
3) Prep profile/T4 prior to starting Ketoconazole and to assess thyroid function - O agrees
4) Ketoconazole 200mg  3/4 tab SID x 21ds PO
5) DC4 Shampoo  Bathe 2x/wk UDF
6) Otic Prep  0.6ml SID AU in am UDF
7) Miconazole/Dex/Triz  0.6ml SID AU in pm UDF
8) Recommended starting diet trial with novel protein limited ingredient diet (Offered home cooked, veterinary diet, OTC diet). O chooses Canadian Naturals Pork diet but declines starting now as he still has a whole bag of lamb diet at home and will wait til it's done. 
9) Recheck in 3wks
