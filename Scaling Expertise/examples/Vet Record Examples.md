**Dr. Tara Dixon**  
## **Dermatological Consult**:

_History_:  
History of allergic disease  
Silver lab - acquired from a breeder  
Masses present on right cheek area and right ear flap  
Right ear flap mass seems to be growing quickly over the past 2 weeks  
Losing hair on body and is itchy

_Ears_:  
**AD** 1.5cm diameter inflamed crusted rounded raised mass on distal medial pinna, _Impression Smear: inflammatory cells only, rbcs_. Ostia and canal are clear of discharge, mild erythema, _Cytology: cocci 2-3+_  
**AS** Distal pinna is thickened. Ostia and canal with excess ceruminous discharge, moderate erythema. _Cytology: cocci 3+, rods 3+_

_Integument/Haircoat_: Overall hair is dry and coarse feeling. Partial alopecia over entire trunk, worse on ventrum. Multiple hypopigmentation spots bilateral flanks. _Cytology: cocci 3+_. 1.5cm diameter rasied firm nodular mass on lateral right cheek area.

_Pruritic Score_: Moderate pruritus

_Diet_: Canadian naturals Senior - Whitefish and beef

_DDX_:  
1) +/- Color Dilution Alopecia  
2) Allergic disease (FA? CAD?) with secondary:

- Bilateral OE
- Superficial Pyoderma/Folliculitis
    
    _Plan_:  
    Discussed concern for breed-related follicular disorder contributing to alopecia issue. We know George has moderate allergic disease; discussed FA vs CAD. Told O we need to determine how much of George's skin issues are due to allergic disease vs follicular dysplasia. This is done by working up allergies and resolving secondary infections, then monitoring response. Told O that this is a process to work through and that allergic dz cannot be cured but can only be managed. To diagnosis follicular dysplasias, skin biopsies are required and this can be considered once the secondary infections are treated. Told O that we could not ID the right ear mass as it is so inflamed. Plan to treat with antibiotics then recheck mass. Told O that if mass is growing quickly we may need to remove it sooner rather than later.  
    Treatment Plan:  
    1) Novel protein diet trial x 2 months (Can Nat. Pork?)  
    2) Otic Prep 1ml BID x 16ds AU  
    3) Apoquel 16mg Chewable 1.5 tabs SID x 21ds PO (dose range from 1.5 - 2 tabs SID)  
    4) Douxo Pyo Shampoo 1-2x/wk UDF  
    5) Cephalexin 500mg 2.5 tabs BID x 15ds PO  
    6) Recheck 3 weeks

**History**:
4 week recheck post ear flush/mass removals
O says she is doing very well, seems comfortable again
Giving all medications OK now, was struggling at the beginning

**AS**   PInna, ostia and canal (vert/horiz) WNL, minimal ceruminous discharge present. TM translucent; normal
*Cytology(canal):  no orgs

**AD**  Lower half of pinna and ostia are thickened and scarred. No erythema or discharge, cyst removal sites have healed well with no new cysts present. The canal opening is mildly stenotic from scarring but more open than at previous exam; can get otoscope cone into canal. The horizontal canal is clear however TM cannot be visualized as canal is scarred and cannot be straightened enough without sedation.
  *Cytology(canal):*  no orgs, occasional cocci*

**Diagnosis**:   Ceruminous Cystomatosis with secondary OM (AD) with external canal scarring/stenosis

**Plan**:
Told O Stripe's ear has healed very well post sx. There is still lots of scarring/fibrosis and the canal is mildly stenotic but these changes are permanent and cannot be reversed. Our hope is that the canal ostia is now open enough to allow some normal self-cleaning by the ear and facilitate maintenance treatments long term. Can trial Dexamethasone tabs in place of Prednisolone to reduce frequency of tx. Trial Cortavance for long term control of inflammation in right ear
1)  Recheck appt in 3 weeks with rDVM
2)  Medications:
   -  Dexamethasone 4mg  1/4 tab EOD x 3weeks. If ear inflammation well controlled can trial 1/4 tab q3ds long term; recommend recheck 3weeks after decreasing frequency.
   -  Cortavance Solution   0.25ml AD 3x/wk long term (administer with syringe)
