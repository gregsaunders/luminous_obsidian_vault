_Hydration_: MM moist, normal skin tent, assessed hydration - euhydrated

_Eyes_: Corneal and conjunctival examination is normal. Pupils are isocoric and pupillary light responses are normal. **mild enophthalmos OD relative to OS. Corneas/sclera/conjunctiva appear normal. IOP OU normal (13, 14)**

_Ears_: AS normal, no discharge, swelling or erythema externally noted. **AD canal with excess ceruminous discharge throughout. _Cytology: occasional cocci/yeast_** .The patient behaviourally seems to hear normally.

_Nose_: The nostrils and nasal planum are normal and air passage is normal bilaterally.

_Oral cavity_: Teeth are in good health, no lacerations or foreign material noted in the oral cavity. All teeth probed and found to be normal. Pharyngeal exam unremarkable. **trismus present - jaw cannot be opening > 10cm**

_Integument_: Haircoat is healthy, no masses noted on exam or reported by owner, skin appears healthy

#### Assessment

**Problem List with DDX**:

3)  Trismus

**DDX**:   Masticatory myositis, polyneuropathy, traumatic injury, retrobulbar abscess

**Working Diagnosis**:   Masticatory Myositis

#### Plan

**Owner Discussion**:
- Discussed the need for sedation to perform a thorough oral examination and potential dental radiographs.
- Explained the possibility of trauma-related issues such as a jaw fracture or foreign object especially in light of Sisko being kicked by a deer recently.

**Diagnostics**:
- Oral examination with sedation - Approved  -  unremarkable
- Skull radiographs - Approved  -  unremarkable

Based on PE with sedation, recommended CT scan with contrast to help rule out traumatic injury/TMJ disease - O agrees

**Plan**:
Due to high suspicion of MMM, plan to start immunosuppressive tx while waiting for CT report.
Prednisone 50mg  1 BID PO UDF
Sent home h/o on MMM with owner, discussed side effects of prednisone and prognosis for this disease
Plan to call O tomorrow to see how Sisko is doing

#### Prescription
**Prescribed By:** Dr. Tara Dixon

Sisko was positioned in sternal recumbency and a CT Scan was performed on the skull.

Contrast was given at 2 mls-kg IV and Sisko was placed on 2x maintenance fluids for 4 hours after procedure.

Specifics

**Dermatological Recheck and Mass Removal**:

Gunner was administered "Fab Four" IV (see anesthetic record for details)

**Ears**:   Both ears were examined with hand held otoscope. The canals were relatively open with minimal ceruminous discharge present. TMs could not be visualized. Medial pinnae and ostias appear normal.

Initially looked like dandruff, that progressed into excessive pruritus and hotspots over ~3 months.
Right ear irritation, with noted bumps on the ear 
Roxy's skin seems to flare during heat cycles and in the summertime 
Many various foods have been trialed with variety of proteins (chicken, beef, salmon)
Gets bathed q2months - Roxy is indoors/outdoors 50/50 in the summer and 80/20 in the winter 
Severely pruritic with general hair loss but no alopecic patches
Legs, axillae, chest, tail and sides of body, ears seems the main pruritic areas
They would like to avoid any systemic medications due to pending breeding
Seems pruritic year-round; hasn't paid close attention to her in the winter months to see how signs are then 



   *Ears*:   Left ear -  appears normal.  Right ear - medial pinna and ostia mildly erythematous, few crusts present. Lower canal is clear.
*Cytology(Right ear):  cocci 3+, waxy debris* 


   *Integument/Haircoat*: Haircoat appears full, no alopecic areas but is a bit dry and dull.  No scale present.
*Cytology(skin): Cocci 2-3+, no yeast* 

   *Pruritic Score*:   8/10  Roxy is scratching excessively in exam room


   *Diet*: Inukshuk kibble with Fortiflora and cod liver oil -- been on this diet for ~5 months; didn't notice any changes in signs with dietary changes 
Gets beef bones q4-6wks 


   *Diagnosis*:  Canine atopic disease  (exacerbated by hormonal changes)


   *Plan*:   Discussed CAD and how signs can worsen during estrus periods/pregnancy. Went over various options for pruritic control including Apoquel, Cytopoint, steroids, antihistamines and the lack of studies investigating safety during breeding, pregnancy, lactation. Options include treating with systemic medications and discontinuing them 1-2wks before breeding or trialing topical tx only.  Os opt for topical tx only. Discussed other options for itch control including atopic diets, topical oil application, etc but safety of these during pregnancy/breeding unknown.

#### Physical Exam

##**Dermatological Recheck: **

   *History*:   
O noticed mass on chest
Allergic dz seems well controlled at this time 
Socks has been doing well, O has no other concerns today 


*Current Medications*: Atopica 50mg 1 SID, DC4 shampoo 1x weekly 


   *Ears*: WNL


   *Integument/Haircoat*: Overall haircoat is healthy, groin appears very mildly erythematous with mild lichenification. Skin is soft, no odor. Hyperpigmentation present in groin. ~6cm slightly raised soft SQ mass, slightly moveable on the right side of sternum, non-painful. 
*Cytology(skin): 2+ Cocci, keratinocytes, occ pollens* 
*FNA: no cellular material on slide except for few lipocytes* Dx: Lipoma 


   *Diet*: OTC kibble and pork 
At this time do not believe Socks has an allergy to food - likely environmental, +/- Staph HS

   *Diagnosis*: 
1)  Allergic dz (likely CAD) - well controlled on Atopica
Cannot r/o Staph HS or resistant bacterial infection but O has achieved good infection control with topical therapy
2)  Anxiety
3)  SQ sternal mass  -  Lipoma

 
   *Plan*: 
Called O to discuss examination and diagnosis of mass (Lipoma; not cancerous). O is happy to hear it is just a fat lump, Socks has been doing very well at home. O states that he bathes with medicated shampoo once weekly and gives Atopica 50mg daily. Socks is showing no signs of GI upset and allergic dz is well controlled at this time. O has no other questions or concerns regarding Socks. Recheck as needed if concerns arise. O is interested in tapering Atopica to 50mg EOD, I let O know I would discuss with TD and call him back if there are concerns/hesitations on pursuing this.
