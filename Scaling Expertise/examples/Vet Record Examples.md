- Discussed the need for sedation to perform a thorough oral examination and potential dental radiographs.
- Explained the possibility of trauma-related issues such as a jaw fracture or foreign object especially in light of Sisko being kicked by a deer recently.

**Diagnostics**:
- Oral examination with sedation - Approved  -  unremarkable
- Skull radiographs - Approved  -  unremarkable

Based on PE with sedation, recommended CT scan with contrast to help rule out traumatic injury/TMJ disease - O agrees

Roxy's skin seems to flare during heat cycles and in the summertime 
Many various foods have been trialed with variety of proteins (chicken, beef, salmon)
Gets bathed q2months - Roxy is indoors/outdoors 50/50 in the summer and 80/20 in the winter 
Severely pruritic with general hair loss but no alopecic patches
Legs, axillae, chest, tail and sides of body, ears seems the main pruritic areas
They would like to avoid any systemic medications due to pending breeding
Seems pruritic year-round; hasn't paid close attention to her in the winter months to see how signs are then 



   *Ears*:   Left ear -  appears normal.  Right ear - medial pinna and ostia mildly erythematous, few crusts present. Lower canal is clear.
*Cytology(Right ear):  cocci 3+, waxy debris*

*Cytology(skin): Cocci 2-3+, no yeast* 

   *Pruritic Score*:   8/10  Roxy is scratching excessively in exam room


   *Diet*: Inukshuk kibble with Fortiflora and cod liver oil -- been on this diet for ~5 months; didn't notice any changes in signs with dietary changes 
Gets beef bones q4-6wks 


   *Diagnosis*:  Canine atopic disease  (exacerbated by hormonal changes)


   *Plan*:   Discussed CAD and how signs can worsen during estrus periods/pregnancy. Went over various options for pruritic control including Apoquel, Cytopoint, steroids, antihistamines and the lack of studies investigating safety during breeding, pregnancy, lactation. Options include treating with systemic medications and discontinuing them 1-2wks before breeding or trialing topical tx only.  Os opt for topical tx only. Discussed other options for itch control including atopic diets, topical oil application, etc but safety of these during pregnancy/breeding unknown.
Treatment protocol:
1) Douxo Calm shampoo  (for anti itch)   bathe 1-2x/week (alternating with Douxo Pyo Shampoo)  Allow 5-10 minutes contact time before rinsing in luke warm/cool water

   *Plan*: 
Called O to discuss examination and diagnosis of mass (Lipoma; not cancerous). O is happy to hear it is just a fat lump, Socks has been doing very well at home. O states that he bathes with medicated shampoo once weekly and gives Atopica 50mg daily. Socks is showing no signs of GI upset and allergic dz is well controlled at this time. O has no other questions or concerns regarding Socks. Recheck as needed if concerns arise. O is interested in tapering Atopica to 50mg EOD, I let O know I would discuss with TD and call him back if there are concerns/hesitations on pursuing this.

#### Procedure 

Invoiced 880449
Stripe was administered a general anesthetic and intubated (see anesthetic record for details) and placed in sternal recumbancy. Both ears were examined with the video otoscope. 

**AS**   PInna, ostia and canal (vert/horiz) WNL, minimal ceruminous discharge present. TM translucent; normal
*Cytology(canal):  no orgs

**AD**  Lower half of pinna and ostia are thickened and scarred. There are multiple bluish-colored small cysts present on ostia. The canal opening is stenotic. The horizontal canal was relatively clear however there was one small ceruminous cyst present which was not raised and was not blocking canal.   The TM was ruptured and the dorsolateral chamber of the bulla was full of ceruminous amorphous discharge, confirming OM.
  *Cytology(canal):*  cocci 1+, yeast 2+*
The ceruminous cysts on the ostia were excised with iris scissors and cauterized with silver nitrate. This helped open up the canal so the scope could be passed into the canal. The ostia is still more stenotic than normal but improved.
The right ear canal was flushed copiously with saline until clear, using the video otoscope and tom cat catheter.  Large ceruminoliths were flushed from the dorsolateral chamber of the bulla. The bulla was suctioned and medication was instilled into the bulla:
   -  SA Baytril Solution  0.1ml
   -  Dexamethasone 5mg/ml  0.1ml
Stripe was reversed and woke up uneventfully with no neurologic deficits

**Plan**:
1)  Recheck appt in 2 weeks
2)  Sending cysts for histopathology to Antech
3)  Medications:
   -  Prednisolone 10mg/ml 0.5ml SID PO until recheck appt
   -  Clavamox Drops  1ml BID x 14ds PO
   -  Otic Prep (Baytril/Dexamethasone/TrizEDTA) Solution  0.25ml AD SID in am until recheck appt in 2 weeks
   -  Ketoconazole/Dex/TrizEDTA Solution  0.25ml AD SID in pm until recheck appt in 2 weeks
   -  Buprenorphine syringes BID x 2ds PO
 

#### Client Communication

TTO to ensure things were going well since switching from liquid Clav to tablet form. O states she is taking the tablets much better than the liquid, O hides it in food and Stripe just gobbles it right up without noticing. O states Stripe is doing very well, starting to act more and more like herself over the weekend and even today O is noticing improvement. O also reports ear doesn't appear as pink/irritated. O has no q/c at this time but will call back if anything changes. DH

#### Proceedure

Specifics
**Surgical Aural Hematoma Repair (AS)**:

Indy was administered a general anesthetic (see anesthetic record for details).  She was positioned in right lateral and the medial pinna was clipped and aseptically prepped.  A thin strip of skin approx. 4cm long x 0.6mm was removed from the medial pinna and the hematoma was drained.  It was then extensively flushed with saline to remove fibrin clots and blood.  Multiple vertical simple interrupted sutures (2-0 Ethilon) were placed on the entire medial pinna to close the hematoma space. The sutures were not full thickness through pinna but only included medial side and cartilage.
Indy was stable through the procedure and had an uneventful recovery.
