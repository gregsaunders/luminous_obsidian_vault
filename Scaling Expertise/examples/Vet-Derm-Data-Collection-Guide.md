# How to Get This Information from a Busy Vet (Without Making Them Hate You)

**Reality check:** Vets are slammed. They won't fill out a 10-page form. Here's how to actually get this information.

---

## STRATEGY 1: The "Shadow & Observe" Method (Best Option)

**What you do:** Spend 3-4 hours shadowing the vet during a clinic day.

**When to do it:**
- Pick a typical day with dermatology appointments
- Ask to observe 3-4 patient exams
- Stay through post-appointment documentation time

**What to watch for:**
1. **During the exam (15-20 min):**
   - How fast does she reach diagnosis?
   - What does she tell the client verbally?
   - What notes does she jot down?

2. **After the exam (45-60 min):**
   - When does she start writing?
   - What does she reference? (Notes, memory, previous records?)
   - What does she type first? Last?
   - How many times does she delete and rewrite?
   - What makes her pause or slow down?

3. **Ask in the moment:**
   - "What information is already in your head right now?"
   - "What's the hardest part about writing this?"
   - "If you could just say what you want and have it magically written, what would you say?"

**Fill out Parts 1, 2, and 6 of the data collection form based on observation.**

**Time required:** 3-4 hours (one clinic session)

## STRATEGY 2: The "Screen Share Recording" Method (If You Can't Shadow)

**What the vet does:** Screen record herself writing 2-3 medical records with voice-over narration.

**Setup:**
- Use Loom, Zoom recording, or built-in screen recording
- 20-30 minutes total recording time
- She talks through what she's doing: "Okay, I know the diagnosis is atopic dermatitis, now I need to explain this to the owner in simple terms..."

**What you get:**
- Real-time view of her workflow
- Verbalized thought process
- Actual time spent on each section
- What she struggles with

**Fill out Parts 1, 2, and 6 based on the recordings.**

**Time required (vet):** 30 minutes to record, you analyze later

## STRATEGY 3: The "Structured Interview" Method (30-Minute Phone Call)

**If the vet won't fill out the form herself, YOU fill it out during a call.**

**Script:**

"I need 30 minutes to understand your workflow so I can build AI that actually saves you time. I'll ask questions, you give short answers, I'll fill out the form. Deal?"

**Questions to ask (in order):**

**First 5 minutes - Document Inventory:**
1. "What are the top 3 types of documents you write every week?"
2. "How long does each take you?"
3. "Which one do you hate the most?"

**Next 10 minutes - Workflow for #1 hated document:**
1. "Walk me through the last time you wrote one of these. When did you sit down to write it?"
2. "At that moment, what information did you already know vs. what did you have to look up?"
3. "What part takes the longest? Formatting? Finding words? Typing?"
4. "If I could magically give you back 30 minutes per document, would that matter?"

**Next 10 minutes - Sample review:**
1. "Can you send me 3-5 examples of [that document type] with patient names removed?"
2. "When you write these, is there a template you follow, or do you create from scratch each time?"
3. "What parts stay the same every time vs. what's custom per patient?"

**Last 5 minutes - Success criteria:**
1. "If AI drafts this for you, what are the 1-2 things you'll ALWAYS need to fix manually?"
2. "What would make you not trust it?"
3. "What would make you actually use it?"

**Fill out Parts 1, 2, 5, and 7 during the call.**

**Time required (vet):** 30 minutes, one-time

## STRATEGY 4: The "You Build It First, She Refines" Method (Fastest)

**What you do:** Make educated guesses, build a draft prompt, test it, iterate.

**Step 1: Get samples (5 min from vet)**
- "Send me 5 examples of [document type] with names removed"

**Step 2: You analyze (1 hour, your time)**
- Read the samples
- Identify patterns (what's always included, tone, structure)
- Note what varies (patient-specific info)
- Draft initial prompt based on samples

**Step 3: Test with vet (15 min from vet)**
- "I built a first version. Give me the details for one of your recent cases, I'll generate a draft, you tell me what's wrong."
- She gives you diagnosis, treatment, etc.
- You run it through AI
- She edits the output

**Step 4: Refine (your time)**
- Track what she changed
- Update prompt to address those issues
- Repeat 2-3 times

**Fill out form based on samples + iteration learnings.**

**Time required (vet):** 5 min (samples) + 15 min (testing) = 20 minutes total

---

## STRATEGY 5: The "Existing Records Analysis" Method (You Do the Work)

**What the vet does:** Export 20-30 recent medical records from EzyVet (anonymized)

**What you do:**
1. **Analyze document types:**
   - Categorize records by type
   - Count frequency of each type
   - Estimate length/complexity

2. **Analyze structure:**
   - What sections appear in every record?
   - What language is consistent?
   - What varies patient-to-patient?

3. **Build initial domain expertise map:**
   - What conditions appear most often?
   - What medications are prescribed frequently?
   - What's the typical treatment pattern?

4. **Create first draft prompt from patterns**

**Then ask vet:** "I built this based on 30 of your records. Test it once and tell me what's wrong."

**Time required (vet):** 10 minutes (export records) + 15 minutes (test) = 25 minutes total

## GETTING THE DOMAIN EXPERTISE (Part 4) - Special Approach

**This is the hardest part. Here's the shortcut:**

### Option A: Record Existing Client Consultations (5 min each)

"Next time you explain atopic dermatitis to a client, record yourself (with client permission). I'll transcribe it and use that as the 'standard explanation' for AI."

**You get:**
- Her exact language and phrasing
- How she explains complex concepts
- What she emphasizes
- Her natural tone

**Do this for top 5 conditions.**

**Time required (vet):** Already doing it, just hit record

### Option B: "Brain Dump" Voice Memos (15 min total)

"For each of your top 5 conditions, record a 2-3 minute voice memo:
- What it is
- How you diagnose it
- How you treat it
- What you tell clients to expect"

You transcribe and structure it.

**Time required (vet):** 15 minutes, she can do while driving

### Option C: Pull from Existing Treatment Plans (You analyze)

If you have sample documents, extract the patterns:
- What does she say about atopic dermatitis every time?
- What medications appear together?
- What's the prognosis language?

Build domain expertise map from samples.

**Time required (vet):** 0 minutes

## RECOMMENDED HYBRID APPROACH (90 minutes total from vet)

Combine strategies to minimize vet time:

**Week 1:**
- Vet exports 20-30 recent records from EzyVet (10 min)
- Vet sends 5 examples of top 3 document types (5 min)
- **Total vet time: 15 minutes**

**Week 2:**
- YOU analyze samples and build first draft prompt (your time: 2-3 hours)
- Vet does 30-min phone interview to fill gaps in workflow understanding (30 min)
- **Total vet time: 30 minutes**

**Week 3:**
- Vet tests first draft prompt with 3 real cases (15 min each = 45 min)
- Vet records voice notes explaining top 5 conditions while commuting (15 min)
- **Total vet time: 60 minutes**

**Week 4:**
- You refine based on her edits
- Vet does final test on refined version (15 min)
- **Total vet time: 15 minutes**

**GRAND TOTAL VET TIME: 2 hours over 4 weeks**

For someone spending 2-4 hours/week on medical records, this is a 1-2 week payback period.

## RED FLAGS (When to Stop and Reassess)

**Stop if:**
- Vet says "I don't have time for this" → Use Strategy 4 or 5 (you do the work)
- Vet won't provide sample records → Can't build accurate prompts, will fail
- Vet wants perfection on first try → Manage expectations: iteration is required
- Vet doesn't see the time burden → Validate the problem exists first

**Success requires:**
- ✅ Vet acknowledges the time burden
- ✅ Vet is willing to test 3-5 times to refine
- ✅ Vet provides real samples or access to records
- ✅ Vet commits to 1-2 hours total over 2-4 weeks

## FINAL TIP: Frame It as "Building Your Clone"

**Instead of:** "Fill out this form so I can build AI prompts"

**Say:** "I'm building a system that writes like you, so you can spend 15 minutes reviewing instead of 60 minutes writing from scratch. I need examples of your best work and 30 minutes of your time to understand how you think."

People protect their time. But they'll invest time to get MASSIVE time back.

**The 2-hour investment to save 2-4 hours per week = 100-200 hours per year.**

That's the pitch.
