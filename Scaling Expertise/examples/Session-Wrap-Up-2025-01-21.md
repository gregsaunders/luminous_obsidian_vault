# Session Wrap-Up: Veterinary Dermatology AI Automation
**Date:** January 21, 2025
**Project:** Scaling Tara's Veterinary Dermatology Expertise

---

## Today's Work Completed:

### 1. Received & Analyzed Sample Records
- **12 EzyVet medical records** covering:
  - Dermatology rechecks (most frequent)
  - New dermatology cases (longest to write)
  - Surgical procedures (ear flushes, mass removals)
  - General wellness/emergency cases

- **3 Additional document types:**
  - Clinical Summary / Referral Update Letter (to referring vets)
  - Client Discharge Instructions (treatment plans for pet owners)
  - Referral Form (incoming - what she receives)

### 2. Key Findings from Analysis:

**Tara's Writing Style:**
- Clinical, concise, technical language
- Consistent structure: History → Physical Exam → Assessment → Plan → Prescriptions
- Uses veterinary abbreviations freely (WNL, NSF, BID, SID, AU, DDx, etc.)
- Writing for other vets (not clients) in EzyVet records

**Common Medications Identified:**
- Apoquel, Cytopoint (atopic dermatitis/allergies)
- Prednisone/Prednisolone (immunosuppression)
- Clavaseptin/Clavamox (antibiotics)
- Ketoconazole (antifungal)
- Douxo S3 shampoos (topical therapy)
- Mometamax, Otic Prep (ear medications)

**Common Diagnoses:**
- Canine atopic dermatitis (CAD)
- Otitis externa/media (ear infections)
- Allergic disease (food vs environmental)
- Pyoderma (bacterial skin infection)

### 3. Identified 5 Document Types to Automate:

**Priority 1:** Client Discharge Instructions / Treatment Plans
- Time burden: 30-45 min → Target: 10 min
- Impact: HIGH - She "never has time to do these well"
- Client education = better compliance = better outcomes

**Priority 2:** Clinical Summary / Referral Update Letters
- Time burden: 25 min → Target: 8 min
- Impact: HIGH - Professional communication to referring vets
- Clear narrative structure, easy to automate

**Priority 3:** New Dermatology Case Records (EzyVet)
- Time burden: 40 min → Target: 12 min
- Impact: MEDIUM - Longest record, but less frequent

**Priority 4:** Surgical Procedure Records (EzyVet)
- Time burden: 25 min → Target: 10 min
- Impact: MEDIUM - Detailed procedure notes

**Priority 5:** Dermatology Recheck Records (EzyVet)
- Time burden: 12 min → Target: 5 min
- Impact: LOWER - Shortest time, but highest frequency

**Total Potential Savings:** 3.4-5.5 hours per week

### 4. Files Created/Updated:

**Created:**
- [Veterinary-Dermatology-Data-Collection.md](Veterinary-Dermatology-Data-Collection.md) - Simple 5-question form (replaced over-engineered version)
- [Vet-Derm-Data-Collection-Guide.md](Vet-Derm-Data-Collection-Guide.md) - Jeff's guide for gathering info (simplified)
- [Vet-Derm-Starter-Prompt.md](Vet-Derm-Starter-Prompt.md) - Template to customize with Tara's style

**Received:**
- [Vet Record Examples.md](Vet Record Examples.md) - 12 sample medical records
- [Clinical Summary - Referral Update For Stripe example.md](Clinical Summary - Referral Update For Stripe   example.md)
- [Referral Form Example.md](Referral Form Example.md)
- [Client discharge instructions example.md](Client discharge instructions example.md)

**Deleted:**
- Over-engineered compliance file (not relevant for Alberta, Canada vet)

---

## Master Context Updates Needed:

### Add to Scaling Expertise Framework:
1. **Veterinary Dermatology Case Study** - Real-world example of framework application
2. **Canadian veterinary practice context** - Less regulatory burden than US
3. **Specialist vs. general practice** - Pattern recognition in complex cases

### Document in Healthcare Prompts Section:
1. **Multi-document automation strategy** - Not just medical records, but client communication and referral letters
2. **Audience-specific outputs** - Same case, different documents for vets vs. clients
3. **Time savings calculation methodology** - How to prioritize which documents to automate first

---

## Next Immediate Action:

**Jeff needs to decide:**

**Option A:** Build ALL 5 prompts at once (2-3 hours work, comprehensive solution)
- Pro: Complete system ready to test
- Con: More upfront work before testing

**Option B:** Build Priority 1 & 2 first (Client discharge + Referral letters)
- Pro: Highest impact items, fastest to valuable outcome
- Con: Still need to build EzyVet record prompts later

**Option C:** Build ONLY Priority 1 (Client discharge instructions)
- Pro: Single highest-impact item, she "never has time to do well"
- Con: Leaves other bottlenecks unaddressed

**Recommendation:** Option B (Priorities 1 & 2)
- Addresses the client-facing documentation gap (Priority 1)
- Addresses professional communication (Priority 2)
- Can test both within 1 week
- Shows immediate value (50-160 min/week saved)
- Build remaining 3 prompts after validating approach

---

## What Claude Needs from Jeff:

1. **Decision on which prompts to build** (A, B, or C above)
2. **Then Claude will:**
   - Build the working prompt(s) based on Tara's samples
   - Include her medications, structure, tone, format
   - Provide testing instructions
   - Include refinement checklists

**Estimated time to first working prompt:** 30-60 minutes

---

## Key Success Metrics to Track:

Once deployed:
1. **Time per document** (before vs. after AI)
2. **Adoption rate** (Does Tara use it every time?)
3. **Edit time** (How long does she spend refining AI output?)
4. **Quality feedback** (Client comprehension, referring vet satisfaction)
5. **Weekly time savings** (Does she get her day off back?)

**Target:** 2-5 hours per week saved = No more unpaid day-off work

---

## Session Status: ✅ Analysis Complete, Ready to Build

**Waiting on:** Jeff's decision (Option A, B, or C)

**Next session:** Build selected prompts with Tara's style, medications, and format embedded

# CONTINUATION - Session Wrap-Up Part 2
**Same Date:** January 21, 2025 (afternoon session)

---

## Additional Work Completed After Initial Wrap-Up:

### 5. Enhanced Context File with Design Principles

**Created:** [Vet-Dermatology-Context-File.md](Vet-Dermatology-Context-File.md)

**Added Critical Section: Design Principles**
1. **Keep It Simple** (Anti-Over-Engineering)
   - Simple = Adopted. Complex = Abandoned.
   - 3-step workflow: Input → Generate → Refine
   - Copy-paste is fine if it saves 70% of time

2. **Mirror the Professional's Existing Process**
   - Don't redesign workflow, slot AI into existing gaps
   - Tara's current: See patient → [Gap] → Write record
   - AI-enhanced: See patient → Quick capture → AI drafts → Review → Paste

3. **Match the Professional's Expertise**
   - AI must sound like Tara, not Wikipedia
   - Context file exists to make AI generate HER voice

4. **Absolutely Simple to Use**
   - If more than 3 steps, won't get used
   - No apps, integrations, complexity

5. **Transferable Framework**
   - Universal pattern for any expertise-based professional
   - 7-step replication process documented

**This context file is now the template for scaling ANY profession's expertise.**

---

### 6. Built Replication Template for Other Professions

**Created:** [Replication-Template.md](Replication-Template.md)

**Purpose:** Universal process to replicate this system for attorneys, consultants, contractors, accountants, etc.

**Sections included:**
- Universal problem pattern (expertise time << documentation time)
- 5 design principles (same for every profession)
- 7-step replication process
- Sample analysis patterns
- Success metrics
- Common failure modes
- **Continuous Improvement section (Phase 2+ only)**

**Key addition: Continuous Improvement Framework**
- WARNING: Don't add until Month 2+ (after adoption proven)
- Simple mechanisms only:
  - Edit log (track patterns)
  - Domain knowledge snippets (new protocols)
  - Prompt version control (track improvements)
  - Quarterly refinement sessions
- What NOT to add (over-engineering red flags)
- Checklist before adding any improvement mechanism

**This makes the entire framework transferable and repeatable.**

---

### 7. Decision Made: Build Medical Records FIRST (Not Discharge Instructions)

**Tara's input:** Medical records are her #1 perceived time burden

**Decision:** Build medical record prompts first, then consider client-facing documents

**Identified 3 types of medical records:**
1. New Dermatology Case (30-45 min → target 10-12 min)
2. General Physical Exam (20-30 min → target 8-10 min)
3. Surgical Procedures (will build later if needed)

**Jeff requested:** Start with Type 2 (New Derm Case) + add General PE prompt

---

### 8. Built Two Working Prompts (Ready to Test)

#### PROMPT 1: New Dermatology Case Medical Record
**File:** [TARA-Prompt-1-New-Dermatology-Case.md](../prompts/TARA-Prompt-1-New-Dermatology-Case.md)

**Features:**
- Complete dermatology-focused exam structure
- Tara's medications with typical dosing (Apoquel, Cytopoint, Douxo, etc.)
- Cytology reporting format
- Owner education themes
- Based on Record 4 (Roxy - atopic dermatitis) as example
- Verification checklist (what Tara must review)
- Dosage reminder (AI suggests protocol, Tara confirms for weight)

**Time target:** 30-45 min → 10-12 min (70-75% time savings)

**Structure matches Tara's EzyVet format:**
- History Record
- Physical Exam (Dermatological Exam)
- Assessment
- Plan
- Prescription

#### PROMPT 2: General Physical Exam Medical Record
**File:** [TARA-Prompt-2-General-Physical-Exam.md](../prompts/TARA-Prompt-2-General-Physical-Exam.md)

**Features:**
- Complete system-by-system exam structure (all body systems)
- "WNL" shorthand for efficient input (Tara types "WNL", AI expands to full professional language)
- Tara's standard language for each system
- Based on Records 1, 8, 12 (general cases, pre-surgical, wellness)
- Use case: Wellness exams, pre-surgical, general medicine (non-derm)
- Verification checklist

**Time target:** 20-30 min → 8-10 min (60-70% time savings)

**Input efficiency feature:**
- Tara only provides detailed input for ABNORMAL findings
- Types "Eyes: WNL" → AI expands to full clinical description
- Saves input time while maintaining complete documentation

**Both prompts use Option A approach:** Full input from Tara for accuracy (no pre-filled "WNL" defaults that might miss nuances)

---

### 9. Created Comprehensive Testing Instructions

**File:** [TARA-Testing-Instructions.md](../prompts/TARA-Testing-Instructions.md)

**Includes:**
- 4-phase testing workflow (Initial test → Generate & review → Refine → Second round)
- Sample test case format (what Tara provides)
- Success metrics (accuracy, time savings, usability)
- Refinement tracking template
- Communication scripts for Tara
- 4-week deployment timeline
- Red flags (when to stop and reassess)

**Testing workflow:**
1. **Week 1:** Get 2 test cases (1 derm, 1 general), run through prompts, Tara reviews, refine
2. **Week 2:** Expanded testing with 2-3 cases each, measure time savings
3. **Week 3:** Real-world deployment (Tara uses for ALL applicable cases)
4. **Week 4:** Optimization, build next document type

**Success criteria:**
- 80%+ accuracy (Tara edits <20% of content)
- Faster than writing from scratch
- Tara says "yes, I'd use this in real workflow"
