# Session Wrap-Up: Veterinary Dermatology AI Automation
**Date:** January 21, 2025
**Project:** Scaling Tara's Veterinary Dermatology Expertise

---

## Today's Work Completed:

### 1. Received & Analyzed Sample Records
- **12 EzyVet medical records** covering:
  - Dermatology rechecks (most frequent)
  - New dermatology cases (longest to write)
  - Surgical procedures (ear flushes, mass removals)
  - General wellness/emergency cases

- **3 Additional document types:**
  - Clinical Summary / Referral Update Letter (to referring vets)
  - Client Discharge Instructions (treatment plans for pet owners)
  - Referral Form (incoming - what she receives)

### 2. Key Findings from Analysis:

**Tara's Writing Style:**
- Clinical, concise, technical language
- Consistent structure: History → Physical Exam → Assessment → Plan → Prescriptions
- Uses veterinary abbreviations freely (WNL, NSF, BID, SID, AU, DDx, etc.)
- Writing for other vets (not clients) in EzyVet records

**Common Medications Identified:**
- Apoquel, Cytopoint (atopic dermatitis/allergies)
- Prednisone/Prednisolone (immunosuppression)
- Clavaseptin/Clavamox (antibiotics)
- Ketoconazole (antifungal)
- Douxo S3 shampoos (topical therapy)
- Mometamax, Otic Prep (ear medications)

**Common Diagnoses:**
- Canine atopic dermatitis (CAD)
- Otitis externa/media (ear infections)
- Allergic disease (food vs environmental)
- Pyoderma (bacterial skin infection)

### 3. Identified 5 Document Types to Automate:

**Priority 1:** Client Discharge Instructions / Treatment Plans
- Time burden: 30-45 min → Target: 10 min
- Impact: HIGH - She "never has time to do these well"
- Client education = better compliance = better outcomes

**Priority 2:** Clinical Summary / Referral Update Letters
- Time burden: 25 min → Target: 8 min
- Impact: HIGH - Professional communication to referring vets
- Clear narrative structure, easy to automate

**Priority 3:** New Dermatology Case Records (EzyVet)
- Time burden: 40 min → Target: 12 min
- Impact: MEDIUM - Longest record, but less frequent

**Priority 4:** Surgical Procedure Records (EzyVet)
- Time burden: 25 min → Target: 10 min
- Impact: MEDIUM - Detailed procedure notes

**Priority 5:** Dermatology Recheck Records (EzyVet)
- Time burden: 12 min → Target: 5 min
- Impact: LOWER - Shortest time, but highest frequency

**Total Potential Savings:** 3.4-5.5 hours per week

### 4. Files Created/Updated:

**Created:**
- [Veterinary-Dermatology-Data-Collection.md](Veterinary-Dermatology-Data-Collection.md) - Simple 5-question form (replaced over-engineered version)
- [Vet-Derm-Data-Collection-Guide.md](Vet-Derm-Data-Collection-Guide.md) - Jeff's guide for gathering info (simplified)
- [Vet-Derm-Starter-Prompt.md](Vet-Derm-Starter-Prompt.md) - Template to customize with Tara's style

**Received:**
- [Vet Record Examples.md](Vet Record Examples.md) - 12 sample medical records
- [Clinical Summary - Referral Update For Stripe example.md](Clinical Summary - Referral Update For Stripe   example.md)
- [Referral Form Example.md](Referral Form Example.md)
- [Client discharge instructions example.md](Client discharge instructions example.md)

**Deleted:**
- Over-engineered compliance file (not relevant for Alberta, Canada vet)

## Master Context Updates Needed:

### Add to Scaling Expertise Framework:
1. **Veterinary Dermatology Case Study** - Real-world example of framework application
2. **Canadian veterinary practice context** - Less regulatory burden than US
3. **Specialist vs. general practice** - Pattern recognition in complex cases

### Document in Healthcare Prompts Section:
1. **Multi-document automation strategy** - Not just medical records, but client communication and referral letters
2. **Audience-specific outputs** - Same case, different documents for vets vs. clients
3. **Time savings calculation methodology** - How to prioritize which documents to automate first

---

## Next Immediate Action:

**Jeff needs to decide:**

**Option A:** Build ALL 5 prompts at once (2-3 hours work, comprehensive solution)
- Pro: Complete system ready to test
- Con: More upfront work before testing

**Option B:** Build Priority 1 & 2 first (Client discharge + Referral letters)
- Pro: Highest impact items, fastest to valuable outcome
- Con: Still need to build EzyVet record prompts later

**Option C:** Build ONLY Priority 1 (Client discharge instructions)
- Pro: Single highest-impact item, she "never has time to do well"
- Con: Leaves other bottlenecks unaddressed

**Recommendation:** Option B (Priorities 1 & 2)
- Addresses the client-facing documentation gap (Priority 1)
- Addresses professional communication (Priority 2)
- Can test both within 1 week
- Shows immediate value (50-160 min/week saved)
- Build remaining 3 prompts after validating approach

## What Claude Needs from Jeff:

1. **Decision on which prompts to build** (A, B, or C above)
2. **Then Claude will:**
   - Build the working prompt(s) based on Tara's samples
   - Include her medications, structure, tone, format
   - Provide testing instructions
   - Include refinement checklists

**Estimated time to first working prompt:** 30-60 minutes

---

## Key Success Metrics to Track:

Once deployed:
1. **Time per document** (before vs. after AI)
2. **Adoption rate** (Does Tara use it every time?)
3. **Edit time** (How long does she spend refining AI output?)
4. **Quality feedback** (Client comprehension, referring vet satisfaction)
5. **Weekly time savings** (Does she get her day off back?)

**Target:** 2-5 hours per week saved = No more unpaid day-off work

## Session Status: ✅ Analysis Complete, Ready to Build

**Waiting on:** Jeff's decision (Option A, B, or C)

**Next session:** Build selected prompts with Tara's style, medications, and format embedded
