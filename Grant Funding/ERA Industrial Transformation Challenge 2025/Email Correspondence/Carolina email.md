Hi Carolina,

Thank you for your response, we appreciate your openness to discuss our technology. 

I'd first like to clarify that our approach is complementary to BE-SPME rather than competitive.  We focus on NA monitoring using our NA biosensors, and have combined a bioaugmentation technology. 

When considering your success of reducing NAs through bacterial and plant remediation at Imperial's constructed wetland initiative, we believe adding large volume cultures of known NA degraders (native to OSPW, non-GMO) to the constructed wetland will further improve and accelerate your NA remediation results.

This Emissions Reduction Alberta (ERA) funding opportunity is a perfect opportunity to help us scale the bioaugmentation solution for pilot deployments. 

Our submission targets: 
 
- Developing optimized NA-degrading bacterial communities (native to OSPW, non-GMO) 
- Creating the bioreactor infrastructure for industrial-scale cultivation 
- Field testing integration with existing treatment systems like constructed wetlands, pit lakes, etc. 

We have received enthusiastic response from another Oil Sands Operator, as well as Tyler Veness from COSIA/Pathways and are currently working on getting further conversations with others in COSIA. We would appreciate an e-introduction to anyone you think is important for this solution and ERA funding proposal.

I apologize on the urgency of this request, but the submission date for submissions is June 12. 

The submission is an "expression of interest" where the ERA is reviewing novel solutions for industrial transformation. The submission is not binding in and way, they are just looking for innovative ideas. They intend to short list projects in the summer, and from feedback we have had so far, our solution is "ticking all of the boxes"

Could we schedule a short teams meeting with you this week to hear your thoughts and get feedback?

Please let me know your availability,

Best Regards,

Jeff
