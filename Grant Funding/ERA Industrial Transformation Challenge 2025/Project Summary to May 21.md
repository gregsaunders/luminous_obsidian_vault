# Current Status and Progress

### Partnership Development

- **Industry Partners**: Initiated contact with:
    - Imperial Oil (Carolina Berdugo) - Previous connection through Shawn's wetlands project
    - Canadian Natural Resources (Christine Brown, Jason Brannick) - Previous research supporter
    - COSIA/Pathways Alliance (Ty Veness) - Had positive initial meetings
    - Reached out to Chris Godwaldt (COSIA Water Advisor)
- **Academic Partners**:
    - Athabasca University - Strong connection through Shawn Lewenza
    - University of Calgary - Established relationship
- **Research Collaborators**:
    - Dani, Doug, and Christine - Exploring mesocosm testing partnership
    - Genome Alberta - Initial discussions underway
    - Ralph Hindle (analytical MS services) - Potential partner
    - Carla DavidsonEndeavour Scientific

### Technical Development

- Biosensor technology: Laboratory validated, ready for field testing
- Bacterial strains: Identified promising NA-degrading bacteria
- Data platform: Conceptual architecture developed

### Funding Opportunity Analysis

- Analyzed ERA guidelines, eligibility requirements, and evaluation criteria
- Identified perfect alignment with "Environmental remediation and sustainability" category
- Confirmed technology fits within preferred TRL range (5-7)
- Developing budget framework for 3-year implementation timeline

### Strategic Positioning

- Developed comprehensive win themes aligned with ERA priorities
- Analyzed alignment with Alberta government environmental mandates
- Created preliminary project presentation materials
- Drafted partnership request emails for key stakeholders

### Remaining Tasks

- Secure formal letters of interest/support from industry partners
- Finalize consortium structure and partner roles
- Complete detailed project budget and milestone plan
- Address GHG emissions quantification methodology
- Finalize implementation timeline and work breakdown

## Assessment and Recommendations

### Additional Considerations

1. **Indigenous Engagement**: While mentioned, we need a more specific plan for meaningful Indigenous partnership and engagement, including identifying specific communities to approach.
    
2. **Regulatory Pathway**: Develop a clearer roadmap for how this technology helps operators meet specific regulatory requirements and standards for water release.
    
3. **Technical Risk Assessment**: A more detailed analysis of potential technical challenges, failure modes, and mitigation strategies would strengthen the proposal.
    
4. **Competitive Analysis**: A thorough comparison with alternative NA treatment approaches (physical, chemical) would reinforce your value proposition.
    
5. **Specific Site Selection**: Identifying at least one specific tailings pond location for the field implementation would add credibility.
    
6. **GHG Quantification Methodology**: Develop a more robust approach to quantify both direct and indirect GHG benefits from the technology.
    
7. **Economic Impact Analysis**: More detailed projections on job creation, economic benefits, and potential market size would strengthen the economic case.
    
8. **Knowledge Sharing Plan**: A more specific plan for dissemination of results and technology transfer would align with ERA's objectives.
    

### Readiness Assessment

You have made substantial progress toward a competitive submission, with strong alignment to ERA priorities and initial outreach to key partners. The core technology value proposition is compelling, and you've developed effective messaging around the win themes.

However, I recommend focusing efforts on:

1. Securing at least 1-2 formal industry partner commitments before submission
2. Developing a more detailed budget and implementation plan with specific milestones
3. Strengthening the GHG emissions reduction case with more quantitative estimates
4. Finalizing the consortium structure with clear roles for each partner

With these elements addressed, you would be well-positioned for a competitive submission by the June 12 deadline.

## Timeline Recommendations

Given the June 12 deadline, I recommend:

- Week of May 20-26: Secure initial partner commitments (letters of interest)
- Week of May 27-June 2: Finalize project structure, budget, and implementation plan
- Week of June 3-9: Draft EOI document and collect final partner inputs
- June 10-12: Review, finalize and submit EOI

Would you like me to focus on developing any of these specific areas in more detail to strengthen your submission?
