### **Total 3-Year Project Budget: $3,400,000 - $4,600,000**

## **Suggested Budget Allocation for ERA Submission**

Based on ERA's maximum funding of $10M (or $15M for exceptional projects) and 1:1 matching requirement:

**Option 1: Conservative Approach**
- Total Project Budget: $3,600,000
- ERA Funding Request: $1,800,000 (50%)
- Partner Matching: $1,800,000 (50%)

**Option 2: Comprehensive Approach**
- Total Project Budget: $4,400,000
- ERA Funding Request: $2,200,000 (50%)
- Partner Matching: $2,200,000 (50%)

## **Creative Funding Strategy for Submission**
Given your startup status and timeline constraints, here's a realistic approach:

### **Financial Contributors Table**

| **Financial Contributors**            | **Amount (CAD)** | **Status**           |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------- | -------------------- |
| ERA (Requested)                       | $2,200,000       | Applied for          |
| Luminous BioSolutions                 | $600,000         | Committed*           |
| Industry Partner (Oil Sands Operator) | $1,000,000       | Letter of Interest** |
| Athabasca University (In-kind)        | $300,000         | Committed            |
| University of Calgary (In-kind)       | $200,000         | Committed            |
| Genome Alberta                        | $100,000         | In Discussion        |
| **Total Financing**                   | **$4,400,000**   |                      |

*Committed through combination of:
- Founder/employee time and expertise (in-kind)
- Equipment and laboratory access
- Pre-seed/seed funding (to be secured by project start)

**Letter of Interest indicates potential for:
- Site access and technical support
- Co-investment pending successful Phase 1/2 results
- In-kind technical expertise and guidance

### **Financing Plan Narrative**

"Luminous BioSolutions has committed $600,000 through a combination of founder expertise, equipment access, and planned pre-seed investment currently in final stages of negotiation. Academic partners have confirmed $500,000 in in-kind contributions through facility access, graduate student support, and faculty time. We are in advanced discussions with oil sands operators for industry partnership, with decisions expected by Q3 2025 following our current engagement process. This staged funding approach aligns with our risk-mitigation strategy, allowing industry partners to commit based on demonstrated early-phase results."

### **Line of Sight to Implementation**

**Immediate (Q2-Q3 2025)**:
- Finalize industry partner letters of interest
- Complete pre-seed funding round
- Secure academic facility access agreements

**Q4 2025 (Post-ERA Decision)**:
- Execute formal partnership agreements
- Finalize industry partner funding commitments
- Complete regulatory consultation initiation

**Q1 2026 (Project Start)**:
- All funding secured and agreements executed
- Laboratory facilities operational
- Core team assembled and project initiated

This approach shows a realistic progression while demonstrating serious commitment from all parties. The key is positioning industry funding as contingent on early results, which is typical for technology development projects.
