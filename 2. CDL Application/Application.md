### Venture Overview

### Venture Name

Luminous BioSolutions Inc.

What is the problem you are trying to solve with your venture and why is this problem important to solve?

The scale of Northern Alberta Oil Sands Tailings Ponds is enormous. According to the Alberta government, as of 2022, there were 1.39 trillion litres of fluid tailings (water + fine solids), and 417 billion litres of oil sands mining water. For continued oil sands mining, there is a constant need for fresh or recycled water, which will contribute to increasing volumes of wastewater generated from the mining process.  
  
Among the organic compounds present in the Oil Sands Processed Water (OSPW), one of the most challenging environmental and regulatory issues the industry is faced with is Naphthenic Acids (NAs). NAs are the most abundant and toxic chemicals of concern, harming aquatic, wildlife, and human life which is raising concerns for surrounding communities.   
  
For decades, the inability for Oil Sands operators to safely release tailings water has:  
- Potential self imposed production cap  
- Delayed land reclamation   
- Increased Operators financial liabilities  
- Intensified public scrutiny  
- Increased Environmental Risk  
  
Industry leaders understand the significance of this challenge, but current NA monitoring and remediation methods are expensive, slow, and impractical at this scale.   
  
Regulators, indigenous, local communities, and investors are demanding solutions that are safe, scientifically sound, transparent, and sustainable.  
  
Naphthenic Acids   
  
NAs are toxic, harming wetlands, wildlife, and human health.  
NAs are persistent in tailings ponds for decades, affecting aquatic life and ecosystems.

### Provide an "elevator pitch" overview of the venture you are building to solve this problem.

Luminous BioSolutions is a Canadian Environmental Technology Company who has developed an innovative approach to detecting and breaking down Naphthenic Acids in Alberta Oil Sands Tailings Ponds.  
  
Our bioluminescent bacterial biosensors provide a fast, simple, cost-effective, and highly scalable method for monitoring NA levels and offering real-time insights that existing techniques cannot match.  
  
How it Works   
- Rapid Detection: Our engineered bacteria detect naphthenic acids within minutes and emit light in the presence of NAs, providing an immediate, easy-to-read signal of contamination.  
Quantitative. The biosensors produce light in direct proportion to the concentration of NA in a sample.  
- Specific and Sensitive: Our panel of NA biosensors detect key NA compounds within the complex NA mixtures that represent the major classes of NA compounds. The NA biosensors can detect the NA at the concentrations present in most tailings ponds (10 -120 mg/L).  
- Scalable & Cost-Effective: Unlike expensive analytical chemistry methods that require weeks of processing, our biosensors allow high-throughput screening at a fraction of the cost.  
  
**Why this Matters**  
Current NA monitoring methods (i.e. Mass Spectrometry) are accurate but suffer from prohibitive costs, slow turnaround times, and limited sampling frequency. This results in low-resolution data, leaving industry and regulators blind to real-time changes.  
  
Luminous biosensors solution allows Oil Sands operators to:  
- Increase testing frequency across more locations throughout the water cycle, providing a higher-resolution map of NA concentrations.  
- Track changes in near real-time, allowing for proactive management rather than reactive mitigation.  
- Reduce environmental risk due to confident and comprehensive NA monitoring data.  
  
For regulators and local communities, this means greater transparency and trust with clear, consistent data that ensures environmental safety.  
  
**Beyond Detection: NA Remediation**  
  
Remediation of NAs in Tailings Ponds is a daunting challenge, as NAs are toxic and persistent for decades.   
  
Luminous BioSolutions are developing our bacterial solutions to accelerate remediation efforts by identifying naturally occurring bacteria that can efficiently break down NAs.  
  
**How this helps Oil Sands water reclamation:**  
- Constructed Wetlands: Our biosensors help identify and select microbial communities that can be used in wetlands to accelerate NA degradation.  
- Bioaugmentation Strategies: We can scale up production of most effective bacteria and introduce them into treatment sites, dramatically improving NA breakdown rates.  
- Continuous Monitoring: Unlike conventional approaches, which rely on infrequent lab tests, biosensors can provide ongoing feedback on remediation progress, ensuring treatment success.  
  
This is game-changing for oil sands operators seeking cost-effective, scientifically sound reclamation strategies that align with evolving environmental regulations.  
  
**Data-Driven Environmental Management**  
It is impossible to make any informed decisions without an accurate monitoring process of NA concentrations in the tailings ponds and a method to track their removal. We have developed an NA monitoring and analytics platform that compiles NA test results in a data hub to provide:  
  
- Real-time tracking of NA levels across multiple sites and throughout the water cycle.  
- AI-powered trend analysis to predict problem areas before they escalate.  
- Regulatory compliance support ensuring all monitoring data is easily visualized and accessible for audits and transparency, if required.  
  
Combining biosensor screening with remediation and data analytics, operators, regulators, and stakeholders are empowered with actionable intelligence for better environmental management.  
  
**A Holistic Approach**   
  
The cost of inaction - both financial and reputational - is too high.   
  
Our biosensors, remediation technologies and data analytics are new, innovative, practical, cost-effective, and scalable.  
  
Adopting our strategies enables oil sands operators to improve their environmental performance, rebuild public trust, and accelerate responsible reclamation efforts.

#### Venture Specifics

  
  

### Describe how your product or service works. This is best done from the perspective of a potential or actual customer. Explain the value proposition for this customer.

At the heart of our solution is a cutting-edge biosensor technology. We have engineered specialized bacteria that act as living detectors for NAs :   
- How it Works: These harmless bacteria are designed to emit light (bioluminescence) specifically in the presence of Naphthenic Acids. The process is remarkably fast – providing a signal within minutes.   
- Quantitative & Specific: The intensity of the light produced is directly proportional to the concentration of NAs in a water sample, allowing for accurate quantification. Our panel of biosensors targets key NA compounds representative of the complex mixtures found in tailings ponds, detecting them at relevant concentration ranges (typically 10-120 mg/L).   
   
Key Advantages: Compared to traditional methods, our biosensors offer transformative benefits:   
o Speed: Results in minutes, not weeks.  
o Simplicity: Provides an immediate, easy-to-interpret light signal.  
o Cost-Effectiveness: Enables high-throughput screening at a fraction of the cost of conventional lab analysis.  
o Scalability: Easily deployable for frequent testing across numerous locations and large water volumes.  
  
The limitations of current NA monitoring is high costs, slow turnaround, infrequent sampling leaving operators and regulators managing with incomplete, outdated information. Luminous biosensors change this paradigm:   
• High-Resolution Mapping: Operators can dramatically increase testing frequency across multiple points in their water systems (ponds, constructed wetlands, treatment processes, potential discharge points). This creates a detailed, near real-time map of NA concentrations and variability.  
• Real-Time Insights: Tracking NA levels dynamically allows for proactive management decisions, identifying potential issues or treatment inefficiencies quickly, rather than reacting after the fact.  
• Reduced Environmental Risk: Comprehensive, frequent monitoring provides greater confidence in understanding NA distribution and behaviour, fundamentally reducing uncertainty and risk.  
• Enhanced Transparency & Trust: For regulators and communities, our technology provides a pathway to consistent, easily understandable data, fostering greater transparency and building confidence in environmental oversight and operator performance.  
  
Luminous BioSolutions provides the tools to truly see the NA challenge in real-time, enabling faster, smarter, and more cost-effective management.  
  
Monitoring is crucial, but the ultimate goal is the effective breakdown and removal of NAs to meet reclamation objectives and potentially enable safe water release. Luminous BioSolutions is leveraging its expertise in microbiology to develop and support NA remediation strategies.   
  
Our Remediation Approach: Harnessing Nature's Solutions  
  
We focus on identifying and utilizing naturally occurring bacteria with the inherent ability to degrade NAs. Our approach integrates seamlessly with our monitoring technology:   
• Identifying Effective Microbes: Our biosensors can be used as a powerful screening tool to rapidly identify the most potent NA-degrading bacteria already present in tailings environments or within treatment systems like constructed wetlands.  
• Optimizing Bioremediation:   
o Constructed Wetlands: We can help select and cultivate microbial communities best suited for enhancing NA breakdown within constructed wetland treatment systems.   
o Bioaugmentation: We can identify the most effective naturally occurring bacterial strains, scale up their production, and introduce them (bioaugmentation) into specific treatment zones or ponds to significantly accelerate NA degradation rates.   
• Monitoring Remediation Efficacy: Continuous monitoring with our biosensors provides real-time feedback on how well remediation efforts are working. This allows for rapid adjustments and optimization, ensuring treatment goals are met efficiently – a stark contrast to relying on infrequent, slow lab tests.   
   
Data-Driven Environmental Management: Actionable Intelligence  
Effective management requires robust data. Luminous BioSolutions has developed an NA monitoring and analytics platform that transforms raw biosensor data into actionable intelligence :   
• Centralized Data Hub: Compiles test results from across multiple sites and stages of the water management process.  
• Real-Time Tracking & Visualization: Provides clear dashboards showing current NA levels and historical trends.  
• Predictive Analytics: Leverages AI-powered analysis to identify patterns and predict potential problem areas before they escalate.  
• Regulatory & Transparency Support: Organizes and presents data in an easily accessible format, simplifying regulatory reporting and enhancing transparency for stakeholders.  
  
This integrated approach of combining rapid detection, targeted remediation support, and powerful data analytics offers a scientifically sound, cost-effective pathway to managing NAs and accelerating reclamation. It directly addresses the need for reliable methods to track NA removal, prove remediation effectiveness, and provide the transparency required by regulators and communities. By facilitating effective NA treatment, our solutions can help alleviate pressure on tailings pond capacity, reducing the risk of operational constraints linked to storage limits.

  

### Who is your customer? If you do not know who your customer is yet, who do you think it might be?

We have three target customers with massive scale opportunities. Imperial Oil, Suncor, Canadian Natural Resources.

  

### What is the value proposition for this customer (i.e., What is the reason a customer will pay for your product/service?) Include quantifiable metrics if possible that highlight the value of your product/service to a customer (e.g., faster, better, etc.,).

Value Proposition for Oil Sands Operators  
Our value proposition is simple: We provide oil sands operators with the essential tools to transform their largest environmental and economic liability, tailings ponds, into a manageable operational challenge. A customer will pay for our service because it directly addresses the critical regulatory, financial, and production risks that threaten their long-term viability.  
  
Why Now? The Perfect Storm of Pressure  
The urgency for our solution is driven by a confluence of immense pressures facing the industry today:  
  
- Impending Production Caps: Operators face a potential cap on production growth if new tailings facilities cannot be permitted due to the massive existing inventory of over 1.4 trillion litres of fluid tailings. Effective management of current ponds is directly linked to the license for future growth.  
- Regulatory Deadlines: AER's Directive 085 mandates that all fluid tailings be "ready-to-reclaim" within 10 years of mine closure. Current monitoring and remediation methods are too slow and inefficient to meet these aggressive timelines with any certainty.  
- Staggering Economic & Environmental Liability: Operators are sitting on an estimated $30B to $130B+ in unfunded environmental liability. This, combined with intense ESG pressure from investors and communities, makes the status quo untenable.  
  
Why Luminous? Providing Control and Certainty  
  
Customers will pay for the Luminous platform because it offers a clear, quantifiable path to mitigate these threats. We provide the certainty and control that is currently missing from tailings management.  
  
- Faster: Our biosensors deliver Naphthenic Acid (NA) monitoring results in minutes, not weeks. This enables real-time operational intelligence, allowing operators to understand their ponds at a speed that is simply impossible today.  
- Cheaper: We target a greater than 50% reduction in cost per data point compared to conventional lab analysis. This makes comprehensive, high-resolution mapping of NA contamination economically feasible for the first time.  
- Better: Our integrated platform provides a clear line of sight from problem identification (rapid monitoring) to effective treatment (targeted bioremediation). This integrated, data-driven approach de-risks multi-billion-dollar reclamation plans and generates the transparent, verifiable data needed to satisfy regulators, investors, and communities.  
  
We are selling the ability to confidently meet regulatory deadlines, systematically reduce long-term environmental and financial liabilities, and ultimately, secure a sustainable license to operate and grow.

  

### Who are your competitors and what differentiates your product/service from them?

Competitors & Our Unique Differentiation  
  
Our core differentiator is that Luminous BioSolutions can operate as a powerful, end-to-end management platform, or as a complementary technology that makes existing solutions more effective, faster, and smarter. We don't just aim to replace current methods; we elevate the entire ecosystem of tailings management.  
  
Our approach creates value in three key scenarios:  
  
1. Enhancing High-Fidelity Labs (e.g., AGAT, Intertek)  
  
We see traditional labs not as competitors, but as crucial partners for validation. The current challenge is that using slow, expensive Mass Spectrometry for broad surveillance is inefficient.  
  
Our Complementary Role: Luminous acts as the high-speed reconnaissance team. Our biosensors rapidly and affordably screen entire water bodies to identify presence and concentration of NA's in minutes. This allows operators to deploy precise, high-fidelity lab testing strategically, for confirming our findings and for detailed regulatory reporting.  
The Value: We provide the "where and when to look," so expensive lab analysis can be focused on the "what, exactly," transforming it from a slow surveillance tool into a targeted confirmation tool.  
  
2. Supercharging Nature-Based Remediation (e.g., Constructed Wetlands)  
  
Constructed wetlands are a valuable, nature-based concept; our technology makes them significantly more effective and reliable.  
  
Our Complementary Role: Our bioaugmentation service acts as a catalyst within these systems. We deploy targeted, native microbial teams to dramatically accelerate the natural Naphthenic Acid (NA) degradation that wetlands are designed to facilitate.docx].  
The Value: We make a good, natural idea faster and more potent. Our biosensors then provide the real-time performance data needed to prove and optimize the wetland's efficiency, offering a level of insight that is currently unavailable.  
  
3. Providing a Low-Emission, Sustainable Alternative  
  
When direct treatment is required, our philosophy is to work with nature, not against it.  
  
Our Standalone Role: Compared to energy-intensive alternatives like Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs) or other physical/chemical treatments, our bioremediation solution offers a profoundly lower carbon footprint. It leverages natural microbial processes that require minimal energy input and avoids harsh chemical additives.  
The Value: We provide a path to remediation that is not only effective but also aligned with the industry's net-zero goals and ESG commitments. It is an environmentally congruent solution to an environmental problem.  
  
What Truly Differentiates Luminous  
  
Regardless of the scenario, our ultimate differentiation lies in our integrated, intelligent data platform.  
  
Whether we are guiding our own remediation, directing lab sampling, or optimizing a wetland, the Luminous platform provides the crucial, real-time data feedback loop that has been the missing piece in tailings management. We deliver a low-emission, nature-based, and data-driven approach that provides clarity, accelerates reclamation, and fundamentally de-risks the entire process for our customers.

  

Briefly explain the size of the market(s)/opportunity that you see for your business. Include metrics where possible.

Our market opportunity is uniquely concentrated and massive. We are not targeting thousands of small customers, but rather a handful of major industrial players grappling with one of the world's largest and most complex environmental challenges.  
  
Primary Market & Scale of Opportunity:  
  
Our target market consists of Alberta's largest oil sands operators, with a focus on securing foundational partnerships with Imperial Oil, Suncor, and Canadian Natural Resources. These companies collectively manage the majority of the oil sands' tailings inventory, and the scale of their problem defines our opportunity:  
  
Volume: Over 1.4 trillion litres of toxic tailings water requires active, long-term management.  
Physical Footprint: A land area greater than 300 km² is currently impacted by tailings ponds.  
Economic Liability: This represents a $30 billion to $130 billion+ environmental and financial liability that operators are under intense regulatory and investor pressure to address.  
  
Our Business Model & Market Value:  
  
Our model is to become a deeply integrated, long-term operational partner. The opportunity is not a one-time sale, but a multi-year service contract for monitoring, remediation, and data management at each site.  
  
Based on our projections, successfully integrating with these three operators represents a serviceable market of $6M to $20M in annual recurring revenue.  
Our vision is to operate and scale these solutions over the next 10 to 30 years, aligning with the long-term reclamation timelines mandated by regulators.  
  
Success with these partners will establish our platform as the industry standard, and ultimately export this Alberta-grown solution to global mining sectors facing similar critical water challenges.

#### Technology Overview

  
  

What is the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) for your core technology?

4 - Technology Stage: Laboratory Testing/Validation of MVP (Alpha Prototype)

  

Describe the venture's core technology in non-technical terms

Our core innovation is a complete environmental management platform that allows us to see a problem, fix it naturally, and prove it’s fixed.  
  
Think of managing a tailings pond like trying to care for a massive, murky lake. Right now, it’s almost impossible to know what’s happening beneath the surface. Our technology provides the clarity that’s been missing, and it has three simple parts that work together:  
  
1. The Detectors: "Living Sensors" that Glow  
  
We’ve developed special, harmless bacteria that act like smoke detectors for the specific toxins (Naphthenic Acids) in tailings water. When our living sensors detect these toxins, they glow. More toxins, a brighter glow. This gives us an easy-to-read result in minutes, instead of the weeks it takes to send a sample to a traditional lab.  
  
2. The Cleanup Crew: "Probiotics" for the Environment  
  
Once our sensors show us where the problems are, we deploy nature’s own cleanup crew. We find the most effective local bacteria already living in the pond that can naturally break down the toxins. We then cultivate these "good microbes", like making probiotics for the environment, and introduce them back into the pond in greater numbers to dramatically speed up the natural cleaning process.  
  
3. Mission Control: A Real-Time "Health Map"  
  
All the information from our glowing sensors feeds into our smart data platform. This creates a live "health map" of the entire pond, showing where the toxins are concentrated, how the cleanup is progressing, and providing the clear data needed for confident decision making.  
  
Our true innovation is how these three parts work together as a smart, feedback-driven system. We use the fast, simple detectors to guide the natural cleanup crew, and use our mission control platform to track the results. For the first time, this provides a clear, cost-effective, and sustainable way to manage one of the biggest environmental challenges in the energy sector.

  

In what specific dimension is your technology able to outperform the competition?

Our technology outperforms the competition in three critical dimensions: unprecedented speed in monitoring, superior capital and operational cost-efficiency, and greater overall efficacy through our integrated, data-driven system.  
  
1. Speed Advantage: Created by Rapid Biology  
  
Our speed advantage comes from replacing slow, multi-step laboratory chemistry with a direct and rapid biological reaction.  
  
How it Works: Instead of shipping samples for complex extraction and analysis, our engineered "living sensors" produce a light signal almost instantly upon contact with Naphthenic Acids (NAs).  
The Difference: This biological process bypasses the significant time delays of transportation, sample preparation, and machine analysis inherent in traditional lab methods, cutting down the time to get a result from weeks to minutes.  
  
2. Cost-Efficiency Advantage: Created by Scalable Biology & Low-Capital Production  
  
Our significant cost advantage is rooted in the fundamental efficiency of biology, from monitoring through to remediation.  
  
How it Works: For monitoring, our primary consumable, the sensor bacteria, can be replicated quickly and inexpensively at scale. For remediation, our "cleanup crew" of native bacteria is grown using standard bioreactors. This biological manufacturing requires relatively minimal capital investment compared to the massive, purpose-built infrastructure needed for chemical production (for AOPs) or large-scale physical separation plants.  
The Difference: The operational cost is also drastically lower. Our "feedstock" to grow the bacteria consists of simple, inexpensive nutrients, a stark contrast to the costly chemical precursors or the immense energy demands of other methods. This combination of low-cost monitoring and low-capital, low-operating-cost biological production creates a powerful economic advantage, allowing us to scale our complete solution efficiently and affordably.  
  
3. Efficacy Advantage: Created by an Integrated Data Feedback Loop  
  
Our greatest advantage is the superior efficacy created by our intelligent, closed-loop system. Competitors operate with a significant time lag, applying a treatment and waiting weeks for feedback.  
  
How it Works: Our platform enables a continuous "Measure -> Act -> Measure" cycle. The speed of our sensors allows our team to see the results of a remediation action in near real-time.  
The Difference: This data feedback loop allows for dynamic, adaptive management. We can confirm our "cleanup crew" is working effectively, adjust deployment strategies on the fly, and target new hotspots with precision. This data-driven adaptability ensures resources are used efficiently and that the remediation process is verifiably working, a structural advantage no isolated monitoring or treatment solution can offer.

  

What is the most exciting data you have that validates your aforementioned technical advantage? Include any links to this data (e.g., publications) if you have them.

Our traction has progressed from a strong academic foundation to real world industry validation, highlighted by compelling results from a recent major field initiative.  
  
1. Recent Field Validation (Unpublished Results):  
Most recently, we participated in a large collaborative project with a major industry partner focused on a constructed wetland. The results were extremely positive and represent a critical validation milestone for our technology:  
  
Sensor Performance Validated: In this real-world deployment, our biosensor performance tracked comparably to gold-standard mass spectrometry, confirming its accuracy and readiness for field applications.  
Clear Remediation Opportunity: The wetland itself demonstrated moderate, natural degradation of Naphthenic Acids. This result is encouraging as it establishes a valuable performance baseline and highlights the significant opportunity for our bioaugmentation strategies to act as a powerful catalyst, accelerating and enhancing this natural degradation to meet reclamation goals.  
  
2. Foundational Industry Partnerships & Validation:  
This recent success builds on a decade of foundational research at the University of Calgary and Athabasca University. This work included early field studies and funding support from industry leaders Canadian Natural Resources and Imperial Oil. Their engagement provided early market validation, confirming the industry's need for this solution.  
  
3. Commercial & Funding Pipeline:  
We are now translating this technical validation into commercial traction:  
  
We are in active discussions with major operators and the Pathways Alliance/COSIA to establish our first paid pilot projects.  
  
We are concurrently pursuing non-dilutive grant funding from programs like ERA Industrial Transformation Challenge 2025, Alberta Innovates and NRC IRAP to leverage our private investment and accelerate development.  
  
In summary, our technology is advancing; we have validated our core sensor technology in the field, established a strong data-driven case for our remediation services, and are now actively building our commercial pipeline.

If helpful, include written context that outlines your strategy to defend/protect your innovation either currently or into the future.

Our strategy to protect our innovation is multi layered, combining formal patent protection with trade secrets and a strong, defensible market position built around our integrated platform.  
  
1. Foundational Patent Protection (the "What")  
  
We have already established a IP foundation by filing a patent application for our core NA Biosensor technology.  
  
Filed Application: Our invention, titled "Bacterial Biosensors for Detection of Naphthenic Acids," is protected under a filed Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) application (WO/2023/039675), with corresponding applications in key jurisdictions including Canada (CA3231393A1) and the United States (US20230086835A1).  
Coverage: This foundational patent protects the novel engineered bacterial biosensors themselves—the "living sensors" designed to detect specific naphthenic acid compounds. This secures our core detection technology in the highly specific and valuable niche of Alberta's oil sands.  
  
2. Process & Platform Patents (The "How")  
  
Our strategy extends beyond protecting a single component. We recognize that our greatest value lies in our integrated workflow.  
  
Future Filings: We have a roadmap to file additional patents covering our proprietary "Detect, Record, Remediate, Detect" process.  
Coverage: This will protect the entire system and method. How our biosensors, data platform, and bioremediation service work together in a feedback loop. Protecting the full process makes it significantly more difficult for a competitor to replicate our holistic solution, even if they were to develop an alternative sensor.  
  
3. Trade Secrets & Proprietary Know-How (The "Secret Sauce")  
  
We understand that not all innovation can or should be patented. Critical operational elements that give us a competitive edge are protected as closely-guarded trade secrets. These include:  
  
- Optimized growth media formulations and culturing conditions for our bacterial sensors and remediation agents.  
- The specific data processing algorithms and machine learning models that power our analytics platform.  
- Our detailed field deployment protocols and operational best practices.  
  
4. Competitive Moat (The Integrated System & Data Advantage)  
  
Ultimately, our strongest defense is our market position, built upon the integrated nature of our platform.  
  
System Synergy: A competitor might eventually replicate a single piece of our system, but our true defensibility comes from the seamless integration of all three parts. The value is in the synergy between the sensor, the data platform, and the remediation service.  
Proprietary Data Set: As we deploy our solution, we will build an unparalleled proprietary data set on NA concentrations and remediation dynamics in tailings ponds. This data will be used to continuously train and improve our predictive AI models, making our platform smarter and more effective over time. This creates a virtuous cycle and a significant data barrier that new entrants cannot easily overcome.

Is machine learning or artificial intelligence a part of the core technology?

Yes

  
Which prediction problem(s) do you intend to address by using machine learning? (Select all that apply)

Forecasting;Simulation;Visualization

  
Describe the machine-learning problem you are solving. Please include a brief description of the core methods or technologies used, inputs, outputs, and approach to validation.

The machine-learning problem we are solving is to transform vast amounts of environmental data into predictive and prescriptive intelligence. Our goal is to move beyond simply reporting what NA levels are today, and instead forecast what they will be in the future, identify risks before they emerge, and recommend the most efficient actions to take.  
  
This allows us to answer critical questions for operators, such as: "Which areas of my pond are at highest risk of increasing contamination?" and "Where should I focus my remediation efforts for the biggest impact?"  
  
Here is a breakdown of our approach:  
  
Core Technology:  
  
Our data and machine learning platform, internally named Confluent, is built on TerminusDB.  
We chose TerminusDB, a graph database, because it excels at modeling the complex, interconnected relationships in our data, linking every sample point to its specific time, 3D location, chemical signature, and subsequent remediation actions. This creates a rich, queryable knowledge graph of the pond's entire history and health, which is ideal for sophisticated machine learning.  
  
Inputs to the Model:  
  
Primary Sensor Data: Real-time NA concentration data from our biosensors.  
Spatio-temporal Metadata: The precise timestamp, GPS coordinates, and depth for every single data point.  
Environmental Parameters: Additional data collected during sampling, such as water temperature, pH, and dissolved oxygen.  
Operational Data: Records of when and where our bioremediation "cleanup crews" are deployed.  
  
Outputs of the Model:  
  
Predictive Heat Maps: A visual forecast of NA concentrations across the entire pond for future time periods (e.g., 7, 30, or 90 days out).  
Proactive Risk Alerts: Identification of "hotspot" zones that exceed acceptable NA thresholds, allowing for preemptive action.  
Optimized Remediation Plans: Recommendations for the most effective locations to deploy our bioremediation agents to maximize their impact.  
Efficacy Validation: Clear reports comparing the actual NA degradation in a treated area against the model's prediction, providing verifiable proof of our remediation effectiveness.  
  
Approach to Validation:  
  
We will use rigorous, industry-standard machine learning validation techniques. Our data set will be split into training and testing sets.  
The model will be trained on the historical data and then tested on its ability to accurately predict outcomes in the "unseen" test data.  
  
We will measure the model's predictive accuracy using standard metrics like Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to determine how close our forecasts are to real-world measurements. This continuous validation process ensures our models are not just theoretically sound but are proven to be accurate and reliable in the field.

How did the founders meet and why are you working on this project?

The founding team of Luminous is built on a foundation of decades of friendship and proven professional collaboration. Our Chief Science Officer, Dr. Shawn Lewenza, and our Chief Technology Officer, Greg Saunders, are childhood friends. Greg and our Chief Operating Officer, Jeff Violo, are long-time business partners and friends. This deep history of trust and respect is core to our team's strength and our ability to tackle this complex challenge.  
  
We are working on this project because it represents the perfect convergence of scientific readiness, market urgency, and personal mission.  
  
The catalyst for Luminous was Dr. Lewenza's three decades of work in microbiology, culminating in a ten-year hyper-focus on developing the very biosensor technology at the heart of our company. It has always been his intention to see this innovation leave the lab and solve the real-world problem it was designed for.  
  
With recent successful validations proving the technology's effectiveness in the field, combined with the growing pressure on the oil sands industry to solve the critical tailings challenge, we knew the time to launch was now.  
  
On a personal level, this project is the perfect intersection of our skills and our values. As long-time Albertans and avid outdoor enthusiasts, we have a deep appreciation for our natural environment. We are also pragmatic supporters of the vital role heavy industry plays in our province's economy. We came together because we are all at a stage in our careers where we are driven to apply our collective experience to something truly meaningful, solving one of Alberta's most significant environmental challenges to ensure a sustainable future for both our environment and our economy.

Explain (using life experiences, if you think they are relevant) why you believe are the right person, or team, to tackle the problem(s) you have set out to solve. We ask this question to allow founders to share anything unique about their backgrounds that positions them for success.

We believe we are the right team because Luminous BioSolutions exists at the rare intersection of deep scientific dedication, proven technology architecture, and relentless commercial drive. Our founding team’s diverse, hard-won experiences create a complete and resilient unit positioned to solve the complex tailings challenge.  
  
Dr. Shawn Lewenza (The Scientific Visionary): Shawn brings over 30 years of deep expertise in microbiology. His career has been defined by tackling incredibly complex biological problems, from infectious diseases like cystic fibrosis to his current focus on the oil sands. After decades of success in the medical field, he deliberately pivoted his focus to dedicate the last 10 years to solving the specific problem of Naphthenic Acids, developing the very biosensor technology that is our foundation. His unique expertise is not just in understanding microbes, but in identifying and applying the right microbes to solve a specific, real-world environmental challenge.  
  
Greg Saunders (The Master Technology Architect): Greg is a master systems thinker with over 30 years of experience building robust software platforms that solve big business problems. Where many science-heavy ventures falter is in translating lab data into a scalable, reliable technology. This is Greg’s core strength. As the inventor of our Confluent platform, built on TerminusDB, he has the unique ability to architect systems specifically for complex, interconnected data. His life's work has been about creating technology that isn’t just clever, but that actually works and endures in the real world.
