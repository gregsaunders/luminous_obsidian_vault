**This Agreement Addendum** is attached to and forms part of the **Pilot Proposal: Integrated Water Readiness Infrastructure** (V1.7) entered into between Luminous BioSolutions Inc. ("Luminous") and [Operator Legal Name] ("Operator") for deployment of the Readiness Infrastructure as described in the Proposal.

**Execution Date:** [Date]
**Pilot Duration:** 9 Months
**Start Date:** [Q2 2026 / Specific Date]

---

## 1. Scope of Work

Luminous will provide the services and deliverables outlined in **Section 8** of the Pilot Proposal for a 9-month deployment period. This includes:

- 3-Panel Biosensor analysis (weekly sampling cadence)
- Relational Context Engine deployment and data integration
- Weekly operational reporting and optimization recommendations
- Four comprehensive deliverable packages (Readiness Baseline, Operational Intelligence, ROI Validation, Future Project Intelligence)

---

## 2. Investment & Payment Terms

**Total Pilot Investment:** $[TBD] (cost recovery, zero profit margin)

**Monthly Retainer Structure:**
- **Month 1 Retainer (Due upon Agreement execution):** $[X]
  - Covers: Initial setup, data ingestion, Month 1 operations
- **Months 2-9 Retainer (Due 1st of each month):** $[X]/month (prepaid)
  - Covers: Lab operations, labor, platform hosting, reporting

**Monthly Reconciliation:**
- Actual costs tracked and reconciled at month-end
- Overage billing: Invoiced with next month's retainer (Net 30 days)
- Underage credit: Applied to following month's retainer

**Grant Matching:**
- Luminous will coordinate 50% ERA / Alberta Innovates grant matching application
- Operator provides proof of budgeted and approved pilot funding for grant application
- Pilot can commence prior to grant approval (Luminous has established relationships with funding agencies and high confidence in alignment)
- Grant funding applied retroactively once approved, reducing Operator monthly retainer by 50%
- If grant delayed or denied, Operator responsible for full monthly retainer

**Payment Terms:**
- All retainer payments due Net 15 days
- Late payments subject to 1.5% monthly interest charge
- Failure to pay within 60 days constitutes material breach (see Section 7)

**Operator Net Monthly Investment (after grant matching):** $[X]/month

## 3. Intellectual Property & Methodology

**Luminous Proprietary IP (Protected):**

All intellectual property developed by Luminous prior to or during the pilot remains exclusive property of Luminous, including:
- Biosensor technology (3-panel assay, reagents, protocols, analysis methodologies)
- Relational Context Engine (software architecture, correlation algorithms, data integration methods)
- Analytical techniques and interpretation frameworks
- Any modifications, enhancements, or derivative works created during pilot

**Operator Data Ownership:**

Operator retains full ownership of:
- All site-specific data generated during pilot (biosensor results, correlations, reports)
- All deliverables specified in Section 8 of Proposal
- Right to use deliverables for internal operations and regulatory submissions

**No Joint Ownership / No Automatic Transfer:**
- No intellectual property becomes jointly owned as result of pilot
- No automatic transfer or licensing of Luminous IP to Operator
- Operator may not reverse-engineer, replicate, or commercialize Luminous methodologies

**Future Deployment:**
- Operator has right to continue using Luminous system under annual monitoring contract (commercial rates)
- Operator may not engage third parties to replicate Luminous methodologies

---

## 4. Data Confidentiality & Security

**Data Handling:**
- Operator data resides in single-tenant, encrypted instance (no co-mingling with other operators)
- Luminous will not share Operator data with third parties without written consent
- Luminous may use anonymized, aggregated insights for product improvement (with Operator approval)

**Data Retention:**
- Upon pilot completion: Operator receives all data in exportable format
- Upon contract termination: Luminous will securely destroy or transfer Operator data per Operator's written instruction (within 30 days)

**Security Standards:**
- Encrypted data transmission (TLS 1.3)
- Access controls limited to authorized Luminous personnel
- Industry-standard cloud hosting infrastructure with encryption at rest and in transit

---

## 5. Performance Validation & Mutual Accountability

**Validation Targets:**

System will validate at least **3 of 5 operational scenarios** by Month 6:
1. Seasonal Strategy (temperature correlation for extended operating window)
2. Flow Optimization (spatial performance mapping)
3. Toxicity Proxy (Panel 2 correlation with O2-NAFC toxicity)
4. Refill Management (recovery tracking for reduced buffer times)
5. Auto-Reporting (automated audit trail generation)

**If Targets Not Met by Month 6:**

Both parties will conduct root cause analysis to determine:
- **Technical performance issues** (Luminous responsibility)
- **Data availability/access issues** (Operator responsibility)
- **Site-specific conditions** outside pilot scope (force majeure)

**Remediation Options:**
- If technical performance issue: Luminous provides additional optimization at cost recovery (no markup)
- If data/access issue: Operator provides required data streams or agrees to timeline extension
- If force majeure/site conditions: Both parties negotiate scope adjustment or timeline extension
- Either party may terminate with 60 days notice if targets cannot be met (see Section 7)

**Success Incentive:**
- Early validation (3+ scenarios by Month 4): Operator receives priority scheduling for multi-site expansion discussions

---

## 6. Collaborative Partnership Contributions

**Operator Contributions (Accelerate Insights):**

The following Operator contributions reduce pilot overhead and accelerate time-to-value:
- Historical data access (PDFs, SCADA exports, weather logs, prior studies)
- Site operations context (seasonal timing, treatment protocols, known anomalies)
- Subject matter expert availability (monthly check-ins, anomaly interpretation, operational feedback)
- Sample collection coordination (if Operator staff can assist with logistics)

Operator-provided resources are voluntary and reduce project costs through efficiency gains.

---

## 7. Termination

**Termination by Either Party:**
- Either party may terminate with **60 days written notice**

**Upon Termination:**
- Operator receives all data and deliverables generated through termination date
- Operator pays:
  - All costs incurred through termination date
  - Pro-rated costs for work in progress during 60-day notice period
  - Final data package preparation and transfer (not to exceed $[X])
- Luminous IP remains Luminous property
- Luminous will securely destroy or transfer Operator data per Operator's written instruction (within 30 days)

**Termination for Cause (Immediate):**

Either party may terminate immediately with written notice if:

- Failure to make payment within 60 days of invoice date
- Breach of confidentiality or IP provisions

**Cure Period:** 30 days to cure breach before immediate termination takes effect

---

## 8. Limitation of Liability

**Service Nature:**
- This pilot is a monitoring and data intelligence service, not a guarantee of specific treatment outcomes
- Operator remains solely responsible for all operational decisions and regulatory compliance

**Liability Cap:**
- Luminous total liability limited to fees paid by Operator during 12 months preceding claim
