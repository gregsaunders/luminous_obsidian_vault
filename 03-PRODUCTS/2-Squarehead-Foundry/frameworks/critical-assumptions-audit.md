# Critical Assumptions Audit: The "Bullshit Detector"

**Document Purpose:** Prevents us from making unproven claims. Ensures we stay "Sensor-Led."
**Date Created:** 2025-11-15
**Version:** 3.1 (Sensor-Led Update)
**Status:** ✅ Active Guideline

## The Guardrails

**Rule #1: Kill the "Vendor Math" ($10M Claims)**
- **Verdict:** Claims of "15% Fresh Water Substitution" are dangerous without data.
- **Correction:** Move these to **"Discovery Hypotheses."** "We have a hypothesis... let's test it."

**Rule #2: The "AI" Trap -> The Complexity Solution**
- **Verdict:** Engineers hate "Black Box AI."
- **Correction:** Sell **"Multivariate Correlation."** "The sensor gives you the data; the engine handles the complexity."

**Rule #3: The Hardware is the Hero (New)**
- **Verdict:** Don't sell the "Platform" before you sell the "Data." They can't correlate data they don't have.
- **Correction:** **Lead with the Biosensor.** "We turn the lights on." The Platform is just how we keep the lights organized.

## Validated vs. Hypothesized Value

### ✅ Validated (The "Safe Bet")
*Lead with this.*
1.  **Visibility Speed (The Sensor):** Reduced feedback loop from 45 days (HRMS) to 3 days (Biosensor).
2.  **Speed of Learning:** Validated recovery in 7 days vs. 14-day conservative buffer.
3.  **Operational Efficiency:** $260k/year in specific optimizations (Kearl Data).

### 🟡 Hypothesized (The "Upside")
*Mention this as "Exploration."*
1.  **Caustic Savings:** Can real-time sensor data allow for dynamic dosing? (Hypothesis).
2.  **Fresh Water Substitution:** Is Toxicity the limiting factor? (Hypothesis).
3.  **Regulatory Trust:** Will the "Glass Box" audit trail actually speed up approval? (Hypothesis).

## Immediate Action Items
1.  **Validate the Blind Spot:** Ask: "How do you make daily decisions with monthly data?"
2.  **Validate the Admin Load:** Ask: "If we gave you daily data, who would have to process it?" (Sets up the Platform pitch).
