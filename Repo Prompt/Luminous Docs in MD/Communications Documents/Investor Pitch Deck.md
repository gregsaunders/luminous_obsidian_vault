# Luminous BioSolutions Investor Pitch Deck

## Bringing Scientific Certainty to Oil Sands Tailings Reclamation

**Contact Info:** Jeff Violo, COO | jeff.violo@luminousbiosolutions.com | 403 813 8529

**Talk Track:** Good morning. I'm Jeff Violo, COO of Luminous BioSolutions. We're bringing scientific certainty to one of Alberta's biggest environmental challenges - oil sands tailings reclamation. Today I'll show you how our integrated biological platform is transforming a multi-billion dollar liability into a manageable, profitable opportunity.

## A Multi-Billion Dollar Liability in Our Backyard

- **Over 1.4 trillion litres of toxic tailings water are held in ponds covering more than 300 km²**
    
- **This represents an unfunded environmental liability estimated at $30B - $130B+ for Alberta's top energy producers.**
    
- **Existing monitoring is too slow and expensive for effective management, and current remediation methods struggle to meet the scale and efficacy required, stalling land reclamation indefinitely.**
    

**Talk Track:** Let's start with the problem. Right here in Alberta, we have 1.4 trillion litres of toxic tailings water sitting in ponds larger than most cities. This represents a $30-130 billion unfunded liability for our major energy producers. The current approach isn't working - monitoring takes weeks, costs are astronomical, and remediation methods can't handle the scale. Land reclamation is stalled indefinitely.

## The Luminous Platform: A Complete, Integrated Solution

**We integrate three core functions into a seamless, intelligent loop:**

### 1. Assess (Rapid Detection):

We use our peer-reviewed biosensors to create a high-resolution map of Naphthenic Acid (NA) contamination in minutes, not weeks.

### 2. Remediate (Targeted Bioaugmentation):

Guided by the data, we deploy teams of selected, native microbes to accelerate the natural breakdown of NAs.

### 3. Analyze (Real-Time Validation):

Our Confluent data platform tracks remediation progress in near real-time, providing verifiable proof of success for operators and regulators.

**Talk Track:** Our solution is a complete, integrated platform that closes the loop on tailings management. First, we assess contamination using our patented biosensors - getting results in minutes instead of weeks. Second, we remediate using targeted bioaugmentation with Alberta's own native bacteria to accelerate natural breakdown. Third, we analyze progress in real-time, giving operators and regulators the transparency they need. This isn't just monitoring or just treatment - it's an intelligent system that learns and optimizes.

## A Clear Path to Revenue

### Assessment & Monitoring Services

- Initial engagement through a paid pilot project.
- Project-based fees for initial site assessment and baseline NA mapping.
- Offer rapid biosensor testing as a standalone service to other remediation providers who need faster, cheaper monitoring.

### Remediation Services

- Service contracts for bioaugmentation projects, priced based on the volume of microbes, water treated or area managed.

### Data Platform (SaaS)

- Long-term recurring revenue contracts.
- Annual recurring revenue (ARR) from subscriptions to our Confluent data platform for ongoing monitoring, predictive analytics, and regulatory reporting.

**Talk Track:** We have three clear revenue streams. Assessment services get us in the door with project-based fees and can serve the broader remediation market. Remediation services provide substantial contract values based on treatment volume. But the real value is our SaaS platform - long-term recurring revenue for monitoring, analytics, and regulatory reporting. This model creates sticky customer relationships and predictable cash flow.

## A Defensible, Science-First Advantage

### Peer-Reviewed & Published:

Our core biosensor technology isn't just a claim; it's validated and published in **ACS Synthetic Biology**.

The market need for our approach is validated by independent research like the **Kearl Wetland Report**, which identified key performance gaps in current methods.

### Multi-Layered IP:

Our innovation is protected by filed patents in Canada, the US, and under the PCT (WO/2023/039675), with a roadmap to patent our entire integrated process.

### Proprietary Data & Know-How:

Our trade secrets include our microbial growth formulas, deployment protocols, and the unparalleled data set we will build, creating a powerful data moat over time.

**Talk Track:** This isn't lab bench science - it's peer-reviewed, published technology validated in ACS Synthetic Biology. Independent research, including the recent Kearl Wetland Report, confirms the market need for our approach. We have multi-layered IP protection with filed patents across North America and internationally. But our real competitive advantage is our proprietary data and know-how - microbial formulas, deployment protocols, and the data moat we're building with every deployment.

## A Concentrated, Multi-Billion Dollar Market

### Total & Serviceable Addressable Market (TAM/SAM):

The $30B+ tailings liability held by Alberta's three largest oil sands operators. Our focused strategy is to provide a complete solution to this core group.

### Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM):

Our initial goal is to secure 1-2 of these operators for pilot projects, leading to long-term service contracts. We project this initial market represents **$6M - $20M in annual recurring revenue**.

### Future Growth:

Success here establishes the global standard, creating expansion opportunities into other industrial wastewater challenges worldwide.

**Target Companies:**

- Suncor Energy
- Pathways Alliance
- Imperial
- Canadian Natural

**Talk Track:** We're targeting a concentrated, multi-billion dollar market. Alberta's top three oil sands operators hold this entire liability. Our focused strategy means we don't need to boil the ocean - just secure 1-2 of these operators for pilots, leading to long-term contracts worth $6-20 million in annual recurring revenue. Success here establishes the global standard and opens opportunities in industrial wastewater worldwide.

## We Don't Compete; We Enhance

**Our platform makes a significant investment like a constructed wetland smarter, faster, and verifiably successful.**

Luminous is the only solution that integrates real-time insight with effective, sustainable treatment.

We are not just a competitor; we are a complementary enhancement.

### Competitive Positioning Matrix:

- **Speed & Clarity of Insight (Low → High)**
- **Sustainability & Efficacy of Treatment (Low → High)**

**Competitors:**

- Status Quo / Do Nothing
- Traditional Labs / Mass Spec
- Standalone Remediation Tech (e.g., Chemicals)

**Luminous:** Positioned in the high quadrant for both speed/clarity and sustainability/efficacy

**Talk Track:** Here's what's critical - we don't compete with existing investments like constructed wetlands. We enhance them. Companies have already invested billions in treatment infrastructure. We make those investments smarter, faster, and verifiably successful. We're the only solution that combines real-time insight with effective, sustainable treatment. While others force you to choose between speed and sustainability, we deliver both.

## Our 36-Month Strategic Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation (First 6 Months)

- **Business Goal:** Secure Anchor Partner LOI & Close $1.5M Seed Round
- **Tech Goal:** Initiate TRL 5 Greenhouse Mesocosm Pilot (Enabled by funding)
- **Milestone:** Fully funded company with a committed industry partner

### Phase 2: Validation (Months 7-18)

- **Business Goal:** Convert LOI to first paid pilot contract
- **Tech Goal:** Achieve TRL 6 with successful outdoor mesocosm pilot at InnoTech
- **Milestone:** First revenue and validation of technology at scale

### Phase 3: Commercialize (Months 19-24)

- **Business Goal:** Secure first multi-year, full-scale service agreement
- **Tech Goal:** Achieve TRL 7 with first onsite deployment at partner facility
- **Milestone:** Commercially de-risked platform with recurring revenue

**Talk Track:** Our roadmap is aggressive but achievable. In the first 6 months, we secure an anchor partner and close our seed round, enabling our greenhouse pilot. Months 7-18, we convert that LOI to our first paid contract and validate the technology at InnoTech's outdoor facility. Months 19-24, we deploy onsite at our partner's facility and secure our first multi-year service agreement. Each phase reduces risk and increases value.
