## 3. The Science

### Peer-Reviewed, Field-Validated, Patent-Protected Technology

Our biosensor technology isn't just innovative - it's scientifically proven, independently validated, and commercially protected. This triple validation gives stakeholders the confidence needed to support biological approaches to NA management.

### Scientific Foundation: Published & Peer-Reviewed

**Construction of Whole Cell Bacterial Biosensors as an Alternative Environmental Monitoring Technology to Detect Naphthenic Acids in Oil Sands Process-Affected Water**

Published in ACS Synthetic Biology - a world-leading journal in biotechnology

**The breakthrough:** Our researchers identified bacterial genes that are induced after growth in naphthenic acids and used synthetic biology to construct a panel of whole-cell biosensors for NA detection using Pseudomonas species native to Alberta's tailings environments.

**View the Publication on ACS**

### Why Biological Monitoring Works

Traditional chemical analysis tells you what happened. Biological monitoring tells you what's happening now. Our bacteria respond to bioavailable NAs, the forms that actually impact environmental and human health. This biological relevance makes our monitoring more meaningful for regulatory decisions and stakeholder confidence.

- **Environmental relevance:** Detects bioavailable forms of NAs that matter for toxicity
- **Stakeholder appeal:** Natural biological approach preferred by communities
- **Regulatory alignment:** Supports OSMWSC recommendation for standardized, frequent monitoring
- **Cost transformation:** Enables mass rapid testing at operational scale

### Field-Validated in Operational Environments:

Our biosensor panel was tested in Imperial Oil's Kearl Engineered Wetland alongside Orbitrap mass spectrometry, demonstrating strong positive correlation with the industry gold standard. This isn't laboratory theory, it's operational validation in real OSPW conditions.

### Quantitative & Operationally Relevant:

The technology produces a bioluminescent signal in direct proportion to NA concentration, achieving detection limits as low as 1.5 mg/L - precisely the range needed for monitoring tailings water (typically 10-120 mg/L). Results in minutes, not weeks.

### Alberta's Native Bacteria Enhanced:

We developed multiple biosensors using naturally occurring bacteria already present in tailings environments. These aren't foreign organisms, they're Alberta's own microbes, enhanced through synthetic biology to serve as living sensors. This native approach increases stakeholder acceptance and regulatory confidence.

## 4. Industry Validation

### Solving the Gaps in NA Nature-Based Remediation

Luminous BioSolutions is committed to providing solutions that work within the realities of the oil sands industry.

A recent, independent 2025 pilot-scale study of a Constructed Wetland Treatment System (CWTS) at the Kearl Oil Sands site provides crucial insights into both the promise and the challenges of nature-based remediation.

**View the Report**

### The Promise: A Solid Foundation

The study, published in the Journal of Environmental Chemical Engineering, confirmed that constructed wetlands are a highly effective foundational technology for treating toxic Naphthenic Acids (NAFCs). It provided definitive evidence that natural, oxidative processes in the wetland can significantly deplete and transform NAFCs under real-world AOSR conditions.

### The Gap: Key challenges identified by the research

While proving the potential of CWTS, the Kearl study also identified two critical gaps that can limit overall success:

1. **The Performance Gap (Slowing Degradation):** The rate of NA degradation was not constant. While initially rapid, the attenuation rate slowed by more than 50% as the season progressed, from -0.53 mg/L/day down to -0.25 mg/L/day. This slowdown can stall reclamation timelines and limit the system's effectiveness on more resistant compounds.
    
2. **The Monitoring Gap (Data Latency):** The study's monitoring relied on collecting physical "grab samples" for complex off-site analysis. This method, while precise, results in low-frequency data snapshots (e.g., every 10-15 days). This significant time lag makes it impossible to understand the immediate impact of system changes (like OSPW refills) or to manage the biological process in real-time.
    

### The Luminous Solution: Enhancing Nature's Performance & Clarity

The Luminous Platform is uniquely designed to address both the performance and monitoring gaps identified in the Kearl study, transforming a passive system into an actively managed and optimized one.

To solve the performance gap, our **Targeted Bioaugmentation** solution directly counteracts the slowing degradation by introducing specialized, native microbial teams selected for their ability to break down the remaining, more resistant compounds.

### Shawn Lewenza

I have developed research programs in microbiology, antibiotic discovery and in bacterial biosensors for diverse applications. We use synthetic biology to engineer bacterial biosensors that detect naphthenic acids, the primary chemicals of concern in oil sands tailings ponds. These NA biosensors are being commercialized as novel tools for environmental monitoring of NA in water, and they also facilitate identifying microbes that degrade naphthenic acids. Our goal is to identify minimal bacterial communities that can efficiently degrade naphthenic acids in water treatment strategies.
