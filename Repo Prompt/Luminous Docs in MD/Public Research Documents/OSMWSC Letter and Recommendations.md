To the Minister and the great people of Alberta,

We are pleased to help chart a path forward to address the critical challenge of oil

sands mine water and tailing ponds management in this province. Over the last year,

our committee reviewed thousands of pages of relevant research, heard from industry,

Indigenous communities, technology providers and many others. We also studied and

debated a diverse range of potential policies and measures to best allow for reclamation

to occur as quickly and safely as possible.

All mines produce tailings and, like other industrial and mining processes, the oil sands

mining process requires water. Yet, unlike other Canadian mining operations, such as

copper, gold and even diamond mines, which operate under clear rules for release of

treated process water, the oil sands lack clear regulatory standards for treatment and

release of oil sands mine water. For decades oil sands operators retained most of the

water used in their processes, resulting in storing large volumes of process water on all

oil sands mining sites. This promoted water reuse and recycling, but for the past decade

or so there has been an acknowledgement of the need to release treated waters as part

of final reclamation of oil sands mines. The accumulation of large volumes of water is

not sustainable, it creates environmental and financial liabilities, and prevents water

from being returned to the hydrological cycle. This is a challenge we can no longer

ignore. The governments have to make a decision now.

Alberta's oil sands operators expect to be, and are, held to stringent environmental

regulations and standards. This will be the expectation of the mine operators and all

Albertans in the approach to dealing with accumulated volumes of process water on oil

sands mining sites.

The challenge of oil sands mine water and tailings ponds is undeniably complex, and

simple fixes don't exist. We recognize the strong and varied opinions surrounding this

issue. Navigating the technical complexities of oil sands mine water and tailings

requires careful consideration of many viewpoints. However, inaction is a choice that will

not only enlarge these water bodies but also place an increasing burden

environmental and economic - on the Albertans of today and tomorrow.

Protecting the health and safety of every Albertan and upholding Treaty rights are

cornerstones of our recommendations. Any path forward must also ensure the

sustainability and restoration of our environment, returning this land to be used for

generations to come.

Guided by our commitment to safety, health, respect for rights, and the environment, we

undertook a deep and thorough examination of this issue. We reviewed thousands of

pages of relevant information and research from provincial, national, international, and

Indigenous sources. We met with, and heard from a wide variety of communities,

industry, governments and others to hear the perspective of all sides of this complex

issue and build a truly informed understanding of potential paths forward.

It is clear to us that complex problems require a multi-faceted approach. There is no

magic bullet or single solution. Instead, a combination of water treatment and

management approaches are needed to effectively manage and address oil sands mine

water.

There are a variety of mine water treatment options available to treat this water.

There is a need for more piloting work to implement some of the treatment options that

might have feasibility for use in treatment of oil sands mine water but our committee is

satisfied that the technology to treat and release oil sands mine water exists today.

While the Government of Alberta must set the clear goals and expectations, the

responsibility for achieving these standards and reclaiming the water ultimately lies with

the industry. Clear, evidence-based rules from the Alberta government will empower

industry to continue to innovate and meet or even surpass - these requirements.

We are delivering a series of effective and evidence-based recommendations to the

Government of Alberta, and we urge them to act on them as quickly as possible.

The enduring health and safety of Albertans and the preservation of our environment

and economy must guide our path forward. We look forward to your response and swift

implementation of these recommendations to address tailings ponds while protecting

the health of local and downstream communities and the environment.

Sincerely,

Tany Yao

Chair, Oil Sands Mine Water Steering Committee

### **Recommendations**

**OIL SANDS MINE WATER STEERING COMMITTEE**

**Recommendation: Segregation of water streams for use or release**

Segregation of water streams for use or release applies to non-process affected water, such as rainwater, surface runoff, muskeg dewatering, non-saline groundwater depressurization, and other water that has not been directly utilized in oil sands extraction or separation processes.

**Recommendations**

Government of Alberta update existing policies and processes to require segregation of water streams, such that non-process affected water, including surface runoff and muskeg dewatering, be prioritized for operational use ahead of Athabasca River withdrawals.

Government of Alberta review limits for release of excess segregated water. Currently, some non-process affected water is held in storage ponds and released under approvals issued by the Alberta Energy Regulator, provided certain water quality standards are met. For instance, water collected from muskeg dewatering is segregated and authorized for release to the watershed under specific approval conditions. The Steering Committee believes there is an opportunity to release more non-process affected water to reduce the accumulation of water on mine sites. The water must meet specified water quality limits under approval conditions. The water in these segregated streams may need to undergo appropriate treatment to meet the quality requirements, so it can be safely released back into the environment.

**Rationale for the Recommendations**

The rationale for recommending the segregation of non-process affected water streams for use or release is driven by the goal of minimizing the accumulation of OSMW on site. Implementing this recommendation would have notable benefits. Firstly, it would help conserve some freshwater resources by prioritizing the use of non-process affected water in operations prior to release. Secondly, segregating and treating water streams can help reduce the accumulation of OSMW on site. If this water is not segregated and released, it is mixed with process affected water thereby increasing the volumes of water to be stored on site.

Segregation of non-process affected water streams for reuse or release has been evaluated against multiple feasibility criteria.

**Policy and Regulatory Alignment**

Adjustments to existing approval conditions may be required to allow for additional infrastructure and treatment facility on site to ensure use of segregated water and to set or update appropriate water releases conditions. This recommendation aligns with Alberta's Water for Life strategy in that it encourages less freshwater withdrawal from the Athabasca River since the non-process affected water is directed towards operations prior to release.

**Environmental Impacts**

There is the potential for additional non-process affected water releases within the oil sands mine region. These releases will need to meet strict approval conditions to ensure the watershed is protected from both water quantity and quality perspectives. The use of non-process affected water on site reduces the reliance on withdrawals from fresh water sources for mining operations. It would require a containment pit and may require an additional footprint in the area to store, process or transport the water within the operations. Balancing these environmental considerations is needed to assess the feasibility of the segregation of water streams on a case-by-case basis.

**Indigenous Perspective**

This recommendation, especially with the emphasis of "keeping clean water clean", aligns with the discussions held with the Crown Indigenous Working Group (CIWG) and Environment and Climate Change Canada. The CIWG, in its Assessment of Alternatives report, recognizes that segregation of water is currently authorized at several mine sites with varying degrees of application'. There may be opposition to the potential release of any water, including segregated water, so transparent and clear communication is required to build trust that the water under consideration for release is non-process affected water, has not been used in the extraction process and is similar to industrial runoff already being released under existing legislation. This will require very clear communication with Indigenous communities, in terms of precisely what type of water is being considered for release and the standards that are being used to regulate these types of releases. Community involvement in the monitoring and reporting of any such releases will be critical to build and maintain trust with communities. Another consideration will be the potential increase of any additional physical footprint required to accommodate further water storage, handling or conveyance related to the segregation of water streams. The potential impact of additional footprint needs to be balanced against water conservation gains, informed by meaningful engagement with Indigenous communities.

**Public Perception**

The public generally has concerns about the release of any water from oil sands mines. This highlights the need for transparent communication, transparent monitoring systems, and stakeholder engagement to address these concerns and to build trust. It will also require clear communication and definition of what non-process affected water constitutes, recognizing that "clean water" can have varied meaning depending on the audience and assumptions made.

**Economic Feasibility and Technology Viability**

Maximizing the use of non-process affected water on site can reduce operator reliance on freshwater sources, while balancing the optimal amount of recycling so OSMW can be economically treated. The Steering Committee recognizes that oil sands mine operators have been recycling OSMW and non-process affected water for operational use. For example, at Suncor, internal water recycling rates at site have surpassed 90%, which includes use of industrial runoff as part of their freshwater intake". It is important to strike a balance between encouraging companies to prioritize using non-process affected water in operations prior to release while considering the potential implications on accumulation of on-site water. Regulations and policies should be designed to incentivize companies to prioritize use, ensuring that overall water consumption and reliance on freshwater sources are reduced. Sustainable water management practices will include the use and release of non-process affected water to manage the accumulation of on-site water.

**Implementation Considerations**

Implementation considerations for recommendation of segregating water streams may require regulatory changes including potential adjustments to existing approval requirements. Federally, the release of excess non-process affected water is generally considered acceptable under the Fisheries Act provided that provincial approval release limits are met, as has been practiced for decades. The Steering Committee recommends establishing an inclusive monitoring program that includes tracking the release non-process affected water. The committee will provide a separate monitoring related recommendation. Additionally, the Government of Alberta may need to assess water quality and water status of the Muskeg River. Furthermore, the government would need to engage with the Indigenous communities regarding any potential policy updates. The specific costs associated with segregating water streams and using non-process affected water can vary depending on the size and complexity of the oil sands operation, the quality of the available water sources, the treatment technologies employed, and other site-specific factors. Implementing further segregation of water streams and releasing excess non-process affected water that meets regulatory standards will help minimize the accumulation of OSMW on site allowing industry to effectively manage water resources.

**OIL SANDS MINE WATER STEERING COMMITTEE**

**Recommendation: Sharing oil sands mine water between oil sands operations**

Oil sands mine water (OSMW) sharing, between mine sites and with thermal in-situ operations, refers to the transfer and utilization of OSMW across these two types of oil sands operations.

**Recommendation**

Government of Alberta update existing policies and processes to increase sharing of OSMW across oil sands operations to offset withdrawals from the Athabasca watershed and reduce the on-site accumulation of OSMW.

**Rationale for the Recommendation**

Encouraging OSMW sharing within the Athabasca watershed between a sender and receiver, who may or may not be under the same operator, enables the optimization of water usage and may reduce the need to draw fresh water from the watershed and may reduce the accumulation of OSMW on a mine site. The recommendation has been evaluated against multiple feasibility criteria.

**Policy and Regulatory Alignment**

The feasibility of water sharing depends on project/site-specific approval conditions. Any modifications to the existing authorizations from the Alberta Energy Regulator (AER) may require notice and approval through the regulatory process. Plans for sharing of water resources, including OSMW, could be included as part of the application process for a new mine or when an operator is making major amendments or upgrades. Operators would need to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements and demonstrate that they have considered all potential environmental impacts from the transfer of OSMW to other operations.

**Environmental Impacts**

Oil sands mining operations currently use about 220 million m³ of freshwater on an annual basis, about 26% of their annual allocation. About 60% of that comes from the Athabasca River, with the remainder from shallow groundwater and surface run-off. Recycled water use increased by 51% from 2013 to 2023. Operators should be evaluating and implementing means of reducing the need to withdraw water from the Athabasca River. Sharing water resources, including OSMW, can contribute to this goal by reducing the overall demand for water provided the quality is acceptable for use at the receiving operations. Pathways Alliance, as a next step, suggests for operators to assess the technical-economic-environmental risks profile and determine viability of this option". Sharing may reduce the existing accumulation of OSMW on individual sites but may not reduce the overall environmental footprint as water still needs to be stored. Furthermore, additional pipelines for shared OSMW transport will be necessary between the sending and receiving sites.

**Indigenous Perspective**

Sharing of water resources, including OSMW, was not noted in the submissions from Indigenous communities. Sharing of water resources was discussed within the Crown Indigenous Working Group, noting that it is currently done to varying degrees in some facilities and that it reduces the need to withdraw water from the Athabasca River as water can be repurposed for other operational uses. However, the transport of water from one site to another may require a pipeline(s), resulting in a physical footprint and possibly additional land disturbance. The potential impact of any additional footprint needs to be balanced against any water conservation gains, informed by meaningful engagement with Indigenous communities, particularly as this was not a specific option identified in the community submissions to this Steering Committee.

**Public Perception**

Alberta's 2013 Water Conversation (Our Water, Our Future, A Conversation with Albertans, Summary of Discussions) emphasizes the importance of collaborative water management practices among industries, including mining, to ensure that water is used efficiently and sustainably. The public recognizes the critical role of water in supporting both the economy and the environment, and there is a strong emphasis on the need for transparent, science-based decision-making processes in allocating water resourcesiii. The public engagement further highlights that the public expects mine operators to adopt best practices in water conservation and to engage in meaningful engagement with local communities and stakeholders. There is an understanding that while mining is a significant economic driver, it must not compromise the health of water ecosystems or the rights of other water users. Overall, the public is supportive of initiatives that promote responsible water sharing, which may include among mine operators, provided these initiatives safeguard the long-term health and availability of water resources in the province.

**Economic Feasibility and Technology Viability**

Water sharing can be particularly beneficial for operators who have both mining and in-situ operations in close proximity. Operators should consider treating OSMW to an acceptable quality to transfer to other sites. In its submission to the Steering Committee, Suncor is currently sharing OSMW with its Firebag in-situ site. Suncor is also evaluating the opportunities to reuse OSMW between their three mining operations to leverage the synergies and proximity of the sites. Operators have already implemented measures to reduce and recycle water, indicating opportunities for water sharing. Sharing OSMW resources, between sites under the same operator is currently occurring, but it has not been done between operators nor is it a common practice. Challenges include transfer liabilities and the economic implications of moving OSWM between sites. To mitigate these challenges, operators could collaborate on infrastructure projects to facilitate water sharing, including the construction of pipelines for water transportation between operations.

**Implementation Considerations**

Key to the implementation will be a review of the existing regulatory policies and processes to identify where sharing of water resources, including OSMW, can be enabled and encouraged between sites under the same operator or between operators. This would include:

1. Reviewing existing mine water management plans for identification and the prioritization of water sharing opportunities over additional withdrawals from the river; and
    
2. Fully examining mine water management plans for new mines and mines undergoing expansion for opportunities that optimize sharing water resources, including OSMW, between a sender and a receiver.
    

Both the sending and receiving operators will be required to comply with existing regulations and policies. Operators should engage the AER to understand the requirements and timelines for sharing of OSMW between sites. Additionally, AER may need to review any operator-specific water management plans under existing approvals to understand implications, necessary improvements or updates required. Public notice might be required during the authorization process, necessitating transparency about the water's use at the receiving facility, as well as the monitoring and maintenance of transport pipelines and water quality. Sharing detailed water management plans, addressing concerns, and seeking public input are essential for gaining public acceptance and understanding. By involving the public, operators can build positive relationships and mitigate potential conflicts. Implementing water sharing among operators involves logistical considerations, such as assessing infrastructure needs for transporting OSMW via pipelines and evaluating the proximity of operations. Leveraging regional synergies can optimize logistics and economic viability, while effective coordination ensures receiving facilities can appropriately utilize transferred water resources. This process may require treating OSMW to meet quality standards suitable for industrial use. Additional pipelines may be necessary, requiring water quality assessments to determine environmental risks and feasibility. Water quality parameters, such as salinity and chemical composition, impact industrial efficiency, with non-compliance leading to operational challenges and increased costs.

**OIL SANDS MINE WATER STEERING COMMITTEE**

**Recommendation: Sharing of oil sands mine water across watersheds**

The sharing of oil sands mine water (OSMW) across watersheds includes both the transfer of OSMW out of the Athabasca River watershed to other areas of the province, as well as the in-basin movement of OSMW across sub-watersheds. Oil sands mining operations are located in the Lower Athabasca River sub-watershed, as illustrated in Figure 1.

**Recommendation**

The Government of Alberta focus policy efforts on management options other than sharing of OSMW across watersheds and sub-watersheds into other regions of the province for use by other sectors.

**Rationale for Recommendation**

The recommendation reflects Alberta's policy to manage water on a watershed basis. The recommendation has been evaluated against multiple feasibility criteria.

**Policy and Regulatory Alignment**

Moving OSMW across watersheds does not align with the principles and goals of Alberta's Water for Life Strategy, which recognizes that water resources should be managed within the capacity of individual watersheds". This approach ensures that water is sustainably managed while protecting watershed integrity. The Committee believes that OSMW management strategies should align with overarching government policy and only under extreme situations should the intent of these policies be overridden. Furthermore, there are significant regulatory barriers presented by this option. Movement of water across watersheds could, in certain cases, trigger requirements under the Water Act regarding inter-basin transfers, including the need for a special Act of the legislature and associated public consultation. Also, conveyance of OSMW over significant distances could trigger environmental impact assessment processes, requiring years to complete. Such regulatory hurdles are unlikely to advance the accelerated management of OSMW.

**Environmental Impacts**

As mentioned above, water should be managed within the capacity of individual watersheds as a first priority. Transfers of OSMW into other watersheds could present environmental challenges related to the sustainability and integrity of Alberta's water resources. These include "physical, chemical, hydrological and biological implications for both the donor and recipient basins". For instance, movement of invasive species into new aquatic environments by such transfers may adversely impact the receiving watershed, depending on the end use and handling of the water. Furthermore, potential impacts to flows in the donor watersheds may result in environmental degradation. Linear footprint disturbance created by pipelines is another environmental factor to consider when evaluating this option.

**Indigenous Perspective**

Indigenous communities prioritize the protection of water, the quality of water, and the health of aquatic systems. Potential impacts on aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems caused by the sharing of OSMW across watersheds may be a concern for Indigenous communities located in both the donor and receiving basins.

**Public Perception**

General public sentiment on water sharing across watersheds is reflected in Alberta's Water for Life Strategy, indicating that water should be managed within the capacity of individual watersheds. This sentiment has since been re-affirmed in public engagements such as the province's 2013 Water Conversation, where it was highlighted that that water should be managed at the watershed level. Participants also expressed a desire to do more to encourage water conservation and reduce water needs within local regions, rather than having to import it from other areas. Participating Northern Alberta communities stressed the importance of proactive planning to avoid the water scarcity pressures faced in southern Alberta.

**Economic Feasibility and Technology Viability**

Transferred OSMW would need to be treated to meet user-specific water quality needs of the receiving watershed. Treatment required for use in the receiving watershed would incur further costs over and above transportation costs. More work would be required to understand water quality requirements and associated treatment costs. Construction and operation of OSMW pipelines present substantial hurdles to the economics of transferring treated OSMW across watersheds. According to Pathways Alliance, costs range from CAD $1 million to $5 million per kilometre for pipeline construction, with additional annual maintenance costs outlined by COSIA at $10,000 per kilometre. The cost to build the infrastructure, including land acquisition, when coupled with the ongoing maintenance and management costs likely make this option more costly than treating the water and re-using it onsite or close to the site.

**Implementation Considerations**

It should be stressed that sharing OSMW across watersheds is not likely to accelerate the implementation of OSMW management strategies and should be carefully evaluated within the broader context of environmental sustainability and strategic policy alignment. The Steering Committee recommends that the Government of Alberta direct efforts toward encouraging local utilization and management of treated OSMW to mitigate future accumulation of OSMW. For instance, opportunities may exist for water sharing between oil sands operators within the watershed, which could provide a more immediate and effective solution for managing OSMW. For comprehensive in-region strategies, please refer to the separate Steering Committee recommendation focusing on local water sharing across oil sands operations.

**OIL SANDS MINE WATER STEERING COMMITTEE**

**Recommendation: Deep well disposal of oil sands mine water**

Deep well disposal involves the injection of oil sands mine water (OSMW) into underground geological formations. The injected OSMW is disposed of beneath multiple layers of impermeable rock, ensuring that it does not contaminate drinking water sources. Alberta has a long history of deep well disposal to manage produced water and waste streams in the oil and gas industry. Oil sands thermal in situ projects commonly use this method for managing process water collected on site once it is adequately reused and recycled according to current regulations.

Deep well disposal for in-situ operations is generally accepted because most of the water used is obtained from deeper groundwater aquifers. Furthermore, there have been gains in offsetting the use of freshwater with saline water over the last twenty years". Also important to note is that viable disposal zones are in close proximity to these operations. In contrast, the oil sands mining industry primarily uses water from the Athabasca River and has limited access to underground disposal zones near their operations. This makes the large-scale use of deep well disposal for managing OSMW less viable.

**Recommendations**

Deep well disposal should be considered as one tool in a comprehensive suite of management strategies for OSMW, including reuse, sharing across operations and, if available, treatment and release to the environment. These strategies should be prioritized to ensure sustainable water management is maximized. In making the following recommendations the Steering Committee recognizes certain circumstances under which deep well disposal would be considered a viable option.

**Recommendation 1: Deep well disposal should be considered as an option for management of economically untreatable OSMW streams.**

Highly concentrated OSMW streams pose challenges for treatment and reuse due to the presence of residual hydrocarbons, heavy metals, salts and other components. These substances can be difficult and costly to remove, and there are currently no release standards in place. Deep well disposal offers a technically feasible solution for isolating these streams from the environment, thereby preventing potential harm to surface water and groundwater resources.

**Recommendation 2: Deep well disposal should be considered as an option to manage the existing accumulation of OSMW while water release standards are being developed and also once all other management options have been fully explored and exhausted.**

The accumulation of OSMW represents a management challenge, particularly in the absence of established water release standards. Deep well disposal can provide a practical solution to manage excess OSMW. This approach helps to mitigate the continued accumulation of OSMW and provides a buffer while longer-term water management strategies are being developed and implemented. However, deep well disposal should not be used as a primary or long-term solution to manage the accumulating OSMW. Regulated limits should be placed on the volume of water that can be injected. An assessment of current policies is necessary to ensure that deep well disposal remains a volume-limited solution used under specific, controlled circumstances. This approach will help manage the risks associated with OSMW accumulation while protecting the environment.

**Rationale for the Recommendations**

The recommendation has been evaluated using a decision criteria framework that considers policy, environmental, Indigenous community, public, economic and technological factors.

**Policy and Regulatory Alignment**

Deep well disposal of OSMW will permanently remove potentially treatable water from the hydrological cycle, reducing the amount of water that could be reused for operations in the region and ultimately, safely released back into the watershed. This approach is inconsistent with provincial water conservation policies and strategies, such as Alberta's Water for Life strategy and Water Conservation Policy for Upstream Oil and Gas Operations, which emphasize the responsible use and conservation of water resources. At a minimum, untreated OSMW should be treated to a level where the useable water can be recycled or reused safely for other operations and/or other beneficial water uses. Implementation of this option would require access to large pore-space volumes over multiple disposal sites, which would require additional assessments, monitoring, authorizations, and risk mitigation strategies under current policies. Acquiring the necessary authorizations may take time, given existing tenure tools are not in place, potentially limiting the ability to accelerate the management of large volumes of OSMW in the region. Furthermore, growing pore space competition for carbon capture, utilization and storage, other disposal, geothermal, and critical minerals from brines could potentially limit access to pore space.

**Environmental Impacts**

Permanent removal of water from the cycle may have negative effects on water resources. Studies have shown that the Athabasca River has experienced reductions in flow during the summer and early fall months over the past few decades. For example, a 2006 study found that summer flows in the Athabasca River had decreased by approximately 30% since the 1970siv. Furthermore, a 2023 study in the region highlighted a general decline in flows over a 63-year period, particularly during the fall weeks. The need to develop an environmental flows framework for Wood Buffalo National Park by the federal government suggests vulnerabilities in the region that may be further exacerbated by removal of water from the hydrological cycle.vi

**Indigenous Perspective**

In the Crown Indigenous Working Group's (CIWG's) report, the option of implementing deep well disposal in combination of other OSMW treatments is recognized as a potentially viable approach. In a 2023 report, the CIWG recommends conducting more research in understanding the proximity and capacity of disposal zones relative to oil sands operations, as well as the complexity of infrastructure requirementsvii.

**Public Perception**

Public perception of deep well disposal of oil sands mine water aligns with the principles outlined in the Water for Life strategy and the objectives of the Water Conservation Policy for Upstream Oil and Gas Operations. Albertans are advocating for water management practices that maintain water within local watersheds, emphasizing the importance of preserving the natural hydrological cycle. The concern is that deep well disposal, which involves injecting treated or untreated mine water deep underground, effectively removes this water from the cycle, potentially leading to long-term hydrological and ecological imbalances. Furthermore, previous engagements with the public and stakeholders (Water for Life, Water Conversation, Water Conservation Policy) has revealed concerns around underground injection of freshwater. Similar sentiments may extend to treatable water that could be reused or returned to the environment, thereby conserving valuable water resources.

**Economic Feasibility and Technology Viability**

The committee understands that deep well disposal options would require the construction and ongoing operation of infrastructure, including pipelines and disposal wells. Unlike in situ operations further south, there are limited geologically suitable deep well disposal sites for OSMW in the mining region. Pathways Alliance's Regional Water Management Initiative Project reports only three potential geological formations for large-scale disposal of OSMW: the Cambrian Sandstone; Elk Point Group; and Woodbend Group. However, all three of these formations are not easily accessible due to their distance from mining operations, necessitating the transport of OSMW distances of 100 kilometres or more. Timelines required to obtain the necessary authorizations, engage with all the involved parties such as Indigenous peoples and local communities, construct the pipeline, and drill the disposal wells may not contribute towards an accelerated strategy to manage and reduce accumulated OSMW on the landscape.

**Implementation Considerations**

Deep well disposal should be considered as part of a comprehensive strategy to expedite the management of accumulating OSMW in specific situations. This approach should prioritize highly concentrated streams that cannot be economically treated and, if necessary, serve as a solution for OSMW requiring immediate management.

**OIL SANDS MINE WATER STEERING COMMITTEE**

**Recommendation: Establishing standardized measurement methods for naphthenic acids**

Naphthenic acids (NAs) are a diverse group of complex organic compounds that are typically found in oil sands mine water (OSMW). These compounds may pose significant environmental and regulatory challenges due to their toxicity and lack of standardized measurement methods. However, it is important to note that NAs are not unique to the oil sands mining industry. They can also be found in other industrial process and wastewaters related to petroleum refining and oil and gas production. NAs structure may vary depending on the source, geological age and location.

NAs are naturally present in the Lower Athabasca Region. Research has suggested the natural presence of NAs in the region's groundwater and surface water". A 2025 study reviews the environmental distribution and behaviour of NAs, focusing on their migration through groundwater and interactions with environmental matrices. The study notes that the Athabasca Oil Sands exhibit natural water-bitumen interactions in the environment.

The presence of NA compounds in water bodies is a concern due to their potential environmental and health impacts. However, the accurate assessment of these impacts is difficult because there are currently no standard methods for measuring NAs. Methods need to be standardized to collect the data necessary to develop and monitor compliance with to be established water quality guideline(s). Hence, accurate, reliable and consistent measurements of NAs are essential in assessing treatment options for accumulating OSMW.

**Recommendations**

**Recommendation 1: Government of Alberta to take the lead in establishing standardized methods for measuring naphthenic acids that are accurate, consistent and affordable.**

There is currently no guidance on NAs in other jurisdictions that could be adopted for regulatory and other purposes. There is a lack of standardized methods across commercial laboratories for measuring NAs specifically, resulting in challenges with providing accurate measurements of NAs in OSMW and in the environment. Standardized measurement methods are necessary to support evidence-based decisions to mitigate potential environmental impacts that could be associated with the release of treated OSMW.

**Recommendation 2: The Government of Alberta should consider high-resolution mass-spectrometry (HRMS) standardized methods that can be deployed consistently across multiple commercial laboratories.**

There have been multiple methods used to measure NAs, including Fourier-transformation infra-red (FTIR) and HRMS-based methods. Using more accurate and standardized methods across the industry will enable comparable analysis. FTIR, which measures acid-extractable organics , does not accurately quantify NAs and should not be considered as a standard method for measuring NAs concentrations. High-resolution mass-spectrometry (HRMS) methods offer a more accurate and reliable approach, necessary to assess water treatment efficacy and environmental regulation adherence. HRMS methods offer high sensitivity and specificity, allowing for the quantification of NAs, which are known to be complex mixtures of organic compounds. Evaluating existing measurement methods can help identify limitations or gaps in current approaches and work towards identifying and developing a commercially available method(s) that are standardized and reliable measurement method(s) for NAs quantification in OSMW and the environment.

**Implementation Considerations**

When considering the implementation of standardized measurement methods of NAs in OSMW, several factors to consider, include:

- **Cost-Effectiveness:** Evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the standardized methods to ensure that it is financially feasible for widespread adoption in multiple labs and long-term use. Measurement methods should be simple to use, with accessible equipment, and effective in quantifying NAs in OSMW and the environment.
    
- **Replicability in Labs:** Ensure the selected method(s) is replicable across various labs, including commercial labs, to maintain consistency and reliability in measurement results.
    
- **Continuous Improvement:** Establish a routine review for the standardized methods to incorporate technological advancements and scientific updates. Calibration and correlation between old and new measurement methods is recommended to minimize data loss during transitions and to make use of existing collected data by regional monitoring and industry.
    
- **Consistent data collection:** Implement consistent measurement methods for ongoing monitoring, evaluation, and regulatory reporting, enabling comparability over time and across different sites.
    

By instituting reliable, accurate, and replicable methods for measuring NAs, the Government of Alberta can ensure precise and consistent monitoring of NAs in OSMW and the environment, thereby enabling informed decision-making and effective environmental impact mitigation. Commitment to continuous improvement and consistency in data collection will enhance the relevance and reliability of these methods in the dynamic landscape of scientific and technological advancements.
