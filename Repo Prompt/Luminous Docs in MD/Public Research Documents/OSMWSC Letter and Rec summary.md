## Letter from the Chair

The committee's chair, Tany Yao, submitted a letter to the Minister and people of Alberta, urging immediate action on the management of oil sands mine water (OSMW) and tailings ponds1. The letter states that for decades, oil sands operators have stored massive volumes of process water on-site, a practice that is no longer sustainable222. This accumulation creates growing environmental and financial liabilities and prevents water from being returned to the natural hydrological cycle3.

Unlike other mining sectors in Canada (e.g., copper, gold), the oil sands industry lacks clear regulatory standards for the treatment and release of its process water4. The committee emphasizes that inaction is not an option and that the government must make a decision now5555. While acknowledging the complexity of the issue, the committee is satisfied that 

**the technology to treat and release OSMW exists today**6. The letter calls on the Government of Alberta to set clear, evidence-based goals, which will empower the industry to innovate and ultimately bear the responsibility for reclaiming the water and land7.

## Summary of Recommendations

The committee put forward several evidence-based recommendations to manage OSMW, emphasizing that a multi-faceted approach is necessary, as no single "magic bullet" solution exists8.

### 💧 1. Segregate Water Streams

The committee recommends that the Government of Alberta update its policies to 

**require the segregation of "non-process affected water"** (e.g., rainwater, surface runoff, muskeg dewatering) from water used directly in the extraction process9999.

- **Key Goals**:
    
    - Prioritize this cleaner, segregated water for operational use to reduce freshwater withdrawals from the Athabasca River10101010.
        
    - Review and expand the limits for releasing excess segregated water (which may require treatment) back into the environment to help reduce the total volume of water stored on mine sites111111111111111111.
        
- **Context**: This "keep clean water clean" approach aligns with discussions held with the Crown Indigenous Working Group (CIWG) and requires clear communication with communities about what water is being released and the standards it must meet12121212.
    

### 🤝 2. Share Water Between Operations

The government should update policies to 

**increase the sharing of OSMW between different oil sands operations**, including between mine sites and thermal in-situ sites131313.

- **Key Goals**:
    
    - Optimize water usage across the entire region14.
        
    - Further offset the need for operators to withdraw fresh water from the Athabasca watershed15.
        
    - Reduce the on-site accumulation of OSMW16.
        
- **Context**: Water sharing is already occurring to a limited extent, such as Suncor sharing OSMW with its Firebag in-situ site17171717. However, expanding this practice would require new infrastructure, such as pipelines, which have an environmental footprint that must be balanced against the water conservation gains18181818.
    

### 🚫 3. Do Not Share Water Across Watersheds

The committee explicitly recommends that the Government of Alberta 

**focus on other management options and NOT pursue the sharing of OSMW across different watersheds**19.

- **Key Rationale**:
    
    - **Policy Misalignment**: Transferring water between basins conflicts with Alberta's long-standing _Water for Life Strategy_, which states that water should be managed within its own watershed20202020.
        
    - **Environmental Risks**: It could introduce invasive species and have unknown chemical and biological impacts on the receiving watershed21.
        
    - **Economic & Regulatory Hurdles**: The plan faces significant regulatory barriers and is likely economically unfeasible due to massive pipeline construction costs, estimated at **$1 million to $5 million per kilometre**22222222.
        

### ⬇️ 4. Use Deep Well Disposal as a Limited Tool

Deep well disposal should be considered 

**one tool in a larger suite of management strategies**, but it should not be a primary or long-term solution23232323.

- **Recommended Uses**:
    
    - For managing 
        
        **economically untreatable OSMW streams** that contain highly concentrated substances difficult to remove24.
        
    - As a temporary option to manage the existing accumulation of OSMW while official water release standards are being developed, and only after all other options have been exhausted25.
        
- **Context**: The committee recommends placing **regulated volume limits** on deep well disposal26. A major concern is that this practice permanently removes water from the hydrological cycle, which is inconsistent with water conservation goals and could worsen the effects of decreasing flows already observed in the Athabasca River27272727.
    

### 🔬 5. Standardize Measurement of Naphthenic Acids

The Government of Alberta should take the lead in 

**establishing a standardized, accurate, consistent, and affordable method for measuring naphthenic acids (NAs)**28. NAs are toxic organic compounds found naturally in the region but also concentrated in OSMW29292929.

- **Specific Method**: The committee recommends using **high-resolution mass-spectrometry (HRMS)** as the standard, noting it is more accurate and reliable than other methods like Fourier-transformation infra-red (FTIR)30303030.
    
- **Rationale**: A lack of standardized measurement methods across labs makes it difficult to accurately assess environmental impacts, monitor treatment efficacy, and enforce regulations31313131. A reliable standard is essential for evidence-based decision-making32323232.
