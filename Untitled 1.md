I'm excited to announce the launch of **Luminous BioSolutions** – a new venture born from over a decade of research and a shared passion for solving real-world challenges in our oil sands industry.

At Luminous, we have developed an innovative bioluminescent bacterial biosensors to help monitor and remediate naphthenic acids (NAs) in tailings pond water. Our goal is to help oil sands operators, regulators, and communities with real-time, high-resolution data, enabling more effective environmental management and faster progress toward safe water release.

Our team brings together expertise in scientific research, technology, and business proving that collaboration, trust, and persistence can drive meaningful change. I’m excited to work alongside brilliant colleagues and long-time friends, and this opportunity to contribute to a cleaner, more sustainable future for northern Alberta.

I look forward to sharing our journey and collaborating with industry partners who are equally committed to innovation and responsible environmental stewardship.

Thank you for your support!
