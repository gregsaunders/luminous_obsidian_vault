We are Canadian Owned and operated.

Our mission is to help the Alberta oil sands industry address the complex problem of Naphthenic Acid (NAs) in tailings pond water. 

We have developed a bioluminescent bacterial biosensor to address this problem. 
 Our BioSensor provides a fast and cost effective way to monitor the presence of NA's in the water.  

We are also developing microbial solutions to accelerate remediation efforts by identifying naturally occurring bacteria that can break down NAs.

This helps water reclamation in:
- Constructed Wetlands: Our biosensors help select and enhance microbial communities that can be used in wetlands to accelerate NA degradation.

- Bioaugmentation Strategies: We can scale up the most effective bacteria and introduce them into treatment sites, dramatically improving NA breakdown rates.

- Continuous Monitoring: Unlike conventional approaches, which rely on infrequent lab tests, biosensors can provide ongoing feedback on remediation progress, ensuring treatment success.

This is significantÂ for oil sands operators seeking cost-effective, scientifically sound reclamation strategies that align with evolving environmental regulations.
