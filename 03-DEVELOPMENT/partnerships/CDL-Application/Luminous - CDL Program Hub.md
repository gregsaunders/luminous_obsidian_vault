# Luminous BioSolutions: CDL-Rockies 2025/26 Program Hub

This is the central "source of truth" for Luminous BioSolutions' journey through the CDL-Rockies Energy 2025/26 program.

## 1. Venture Overview

* **Description:** Luminous provides an integrated "test-and-treat" platform for naphthenic acids (NAs) in oil sands processed water (OSPW).
* **Technology:**
    * **1. Biosensors (TRL 7-8):** Engineered bacteria that provide quantified NA results within 24 hours.
    * **2. Confluent Data Platform:** A data analytics system to deliver actionable insights for treatment.
    * **3. Bioaugmentation (TRL 3-4):** Proprietary bacterial "clean-up crews" for future remediation service.
* **Value Proposition:** Replaces the 6-8 week, \$700-\$1,000/sample HRMS lab analysis with a 24-hour, cost-effective monitoring service.
* **Long-Term Vision:** Capture NA testing market (Years 1-3) and launch integrated bioaugmentation service (Years 5-7) to become the "central operating system for water treatment".

## 2. Company Snapshot (Pre-Session 1)

* **Founders:** Jeff Violo (COO), Greg Saunders (CTO), Shawn Lewenza (CSO).
* **Capitalization:** 51% Lewenza Labs (Shawn Lewenza), 49% Confluent Innovations Inc. (Violo, Saunders).
* **Financials:**
    * **Revenue:** Pre-revenue.
    * **Burn:** \$7.5K CAD / month.
    * **Runway:** ~9 months (as of Nov 2025).
    * **Raising:** \$1.5M CAD SAFE (Terms TBD).

## 3. CDL Program Status (Post-Session 1)

* **Stream:** CDL-Rockies Energy 2025/26.
* **Venture Leader:** [Denis Streltsov][p-denis].
* **Status:** Successfully passed Session 1. Proceeding to Session 2 (12-week sprint).

### Mentor Team

* **Lead Mentor:** [Jocelyn McMinn][m-jocelyn].
* **Formal Mentors (4+ hrs committed):**
    * [Terence Tham][m-terence].
    * [Dave Lee][m-dave].
* **Informal Mentors (Offered support):**
    * [Doug Beach][m-doug].
    * [Michael Lipsett][m-michael].

### Key Insights from Session 1

This is the "why" behind our new objectives.

1.  **Stop Defending the Science:** The science is validated (peer-reviewed paper, Imperial pilot). The new focus must be on **commercial and operational value**.
2.  **Sell "Operational Intelligence":** Mentors (like Judy Fairbairn) identified the core value in the "feedback loop with the operations". Our platform is an *Operational Intelligence* tool that enables cost-saving adjustments in near-real-time, not just a testing kit.
3.  **The Company is Investable:** Securing 5 mentors is strong validation. We must translate this momentum into a defensible budget and a clear "ask" to secure capital.

## 4. Sprint 2: Objectives & Next Steps

### Finalized Objectives (for Session 2)

*These are the new objectives, revised from the original documents based on Session 1 feedback.*

1.  **OBJECTIVE 1 (Pilot):** Secure one paid pilot with a major oil sands operator (CNRL, Suncor, or Imperial) for deployment in Q2 2026, with a goal to convert to an annual monitoring contract.
2.  **OBJECTIVE 2 (Messaging):** Develop an operational execution strategy and "playbook" that reframes our solution as an "Operational Intelligence Platform," providing real-time data to optimize treatment and reduce operational costs.
3.  **OBJECTIVE 3 (Capital):** Finalize a 24-month pro-forma budget and technical-commercial roadmap to support a \$1.5M pre-seed round, and secure \$250k in non-dilutive matching funds.

### Immediate Action Items (from Denis Streltsov)
