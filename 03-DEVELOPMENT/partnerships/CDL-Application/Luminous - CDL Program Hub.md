# Luminous BioSolutions: CDL-Rockies 2025/26 Program Hub

This is the central "source of truth" for Luminous BioSolutions' journey through the CDL-Rockies Energy 2025/26 program.

## 1. Venture Overview

* **Description:** Luminous provides an integrated "test-and-treat" platform for naphthenic acids (NAs) in oil sands processed water (OSPW).
* **Technology:**
    * **1. Biosensors (TRL 7-8):** Engineered bacteria that provide quantified NA results within 24 hours.
    * **2. Confluent Data Platform:** A data analytics system to deliver actionable insights for treatment.
    * **3. Bioaugmentation (TRL 3-4):** Proprietary bacterial "clean-up crews" for future remediation service.
* **Value Proposition:** Replaces the 6-8 week, \$700-\$1,000/sample HRMS lab analysis with a 24-hour, cost-effective monitoring service.
* **Long-Term Vision:**
    * **1. Hyper-focus:** Capture the NA testing market (Years 1-3).
    * **2. "Trojan Horse" (via [Doug Beach][m-doug]):** Evolve from a testing service into the central data-processing platform for *all* client water analytics.
    * **3. New Markets:** Expand to adjacent regulated (Offshore Europe) and non-regulated (Refinery VDUs) markets.
    * **4. "Test-and-Treat":** Launch integrated bioaugmentation service (Years 5-7).

## 2. Company Snapshot (Pre-Session 1)

* **Founders:** Jeff Violo (COO), Greg Saunders (CTO), Shawn Lewenza (CSO).
* **Capitalization:** 51% Lewenza Labs (Shawn Lewenza), 49% Confluent Innovations Inc. (Violo, Saunders).
* **Financials:**
    * **Revenue:** Pre-revenue.
    * **Burn:** \$7.5K CAD / month.
    * **Runway:** ~9 months (as of Nov 2025).
    * **Raising:** \$1.5M CAD SAFE (Terms TBD).

## 3. CDL Program Status (Post-Session 1)

* **Stream:** CDL-Rockies Energy 2025/26.
* **Venture Leader:** [Denis Streltsov][p-denis].
* **Status:** Successfully passed Session 1. Proceeding to Session 2 (12-week sprint).

### Mentor Team

* **Lead Mentor:** [Jocelyn McMinn][m-jocelyn].
* **Formal Mentors (4+ hrs committed):**
    * [Terence Tham][m-terence].
    * [Dave Lee][m-dave].
* **Informal Mentors (Offered support):**
    * [Doug Beach][m-doug].
    * [Michael Lipsett][m-michael].

### Key Insights from Session 1 (Enriched by [LRD Notes][doc-lrd-notes])

This is the "why" behind our new objectives.

1.  **Extreme Validation:** The tech is considered "well advanced and proven." [Mike Lipsett][m-michael] ("former head of Tailings Research for Suncor") called it **"extremely exciting"** and "crucial for acceptance by both the regulator and operators."
2.  **Refined Sales Message:** Our pitch is **"an and, not an either or"** ([Steve Lau][m-steve]). We sell both regulatory compliance AND operational efficiency. The operational angle "will get you in the door faster."
3.  **Powerful ROI Statement:** Our 24-hour result (vs. 3 months) is the core value. As mentors noted, **"7 to 12 hours. That's enough time to change things. It's better than three months."**
4.  **"Technically Massive" Market:** The Alberta oil sands "beachhead" has been confirmed as "technically massive" by CDL standards. The mentor consensus ([Mike Backus][m-mike]) is to **"hyper-focus on that"** before expanding.
5.  **Proactive Regulator Strategy:** We have a new mandate from [Patrick Elliott][m-patrick]: **"Get into their kitchen and start talking right away... do it in partnership with your customer."** We must not wait for regulations to happen *to* us.

## 4. Sprint 2: Objectives & Next Steps

### Finalized Objectives (for Session 2)

1.  **OBJECTIVE 1 (Pilot):** Secure one paid pilot with a major oil sands operator (CNRL, Suncor, or Imperial) for deployment in Q2 2026, with a goal to convert to an annual monitoring contract.
2.  **OBJECTIVE 2 (Messaging):** Develop an operational execution strategy and "playbook" that reframes our solution as an "Operational Intelligence Platform," proving it can save operational costs in near-real-time.
3.  **OBJECTIVE 3 (Capital):** Finalize a 24-month pro-forma budget and technical-commercial roadmap to support a \$1.5M pre-seed round, and secure \$250k in non-dilutive matching funds.
