## PURPOSE OF THIS VIDEO

CDL mentors will watch this 90-second video **before** Session 1 (November 7) to quickly understand:
1. What problem we're solving and why it's urgent
2. Our technical credibility (peer-reviewed science, field validation)
3. Our integrated platform advantage (not just sensors)
4. Our execution readiness (operator conversations, clear commercial path)

**Goal:** Make mentors think *"I need to introduce them to operators immediately"* and *"This team can execute - they're ahead of typical early-stage ventures"*

---

## VIDEO OVERVIEW

**Runtime:** 90 seconds (strict - CDL requirement)
**Format:** Founder-led, speaking directly to camera
**Tone:** Confident, urgent, data-driven (not hype, not corporate)
**Key Message:** Integrated NA intelligence platform solving billion-dollar problem with 12-18 month regulatory forcing function

### Speaking Breakdown:
- **Jeff:** 50 seconds (primary voice - commercial urgency + traction)
- **Shawn:** 10 seconds (scientific credibility - peer-reviewed validation)
- **Greg:** 20 seconds (technical depth - Confluent platform intelligence)

---

## COMPLETE SCRIPT (90 SECONDS)

### **SCENE 1: THE FORCING FUNCTION (0:00 - 0:20) - JEFF**

**Setting:** Clean office background (bookshelf or whiteboard visible)
**Camera:** Medium shot, Jeff speaking directly to camera
**Energy:** Confident, establishing urgency

**JEFF SCRIPT:**
*"Alberta's oil sands operators are managing 1.4 trillion litres of toxic tailings water, and they're running out of time and space. The Alberta Government is finalizing water release guidelines within 12-18 months, forcing operators to move from indefinite containment to preparing water for regulated release. But here's the problem: current monitoring takes 6-8 weeks per test. You can't manage a billion-dollar reclamation project when you're flying blind for two months between data points."*

**Key phrases to emphasize:**
- "1.4 trillion litres"
- "12-18 months"
- "6-8 weeks per test"
- "flying blind for two months"

---

### **SCENE 2: THE SOLUTION (0:20 - 0:45) - JEFF → SHAWN → JEFF**

**JEFF (0:20 - 0:25):**
**Setting:** Same as Scene 1
**Camera:** Medium shot

**JEFF SCRIPT:**
*"Luminous BioSolutions gives operators the operational intelligence they need. We've built an integrated NA monitoring platform combining two breakthroughs:"*

---

**SHAWN (0:25 - 0:35):**
**Setting:** Lab bench OR field setting (establishes scientific credibility)
**Camera:** Medium shot, Shawn speaking to camera
**Energy:** Authoritative, matter-of-fact (scientist explaining proven tech)

**SHAWN SCRIPT:**
*"Our peer-reviewed biosensors deliver 24-hour naphthenic acid results. Our Technology has been published in ACS Synthetic Biology and field-validated at Imperial's Kearl wetland pilot that just wrapped up in June. We've compressed weeks into hours with engineered specificity that mass spec labs can't match for operational screening."*

**Key phrases to emphasize:**
- "peer-reviewed"
- "ACS Synthetic Biology"
- "Imperial's Kearl wetland"
- "24-hour results"

---

**JEFF (0:35 - 0:45):**
**Setting:** Back to office
**Camera:** Medium shot

**JEFF SCRIPT:**
*"That rapid data feeds our Confluent AI-native intelligence platform -"*

**[Transition to Greg]**

---

### **SCENE 3: THE INTEGRATION ADVANTAGE (0:45 - 1:05) - GREG**

**Setting:** Desk with dual monitors showing Confluent dashboard behind him OR standing with dashboard visible
**Camera:** Medium shot
**Energy:** Technical confidence, showing platform depth

**GREG SCRIPT:**
*"Confluent transforms that monitoring data into operational intelligence. Operators ask questions in plain English: 'Which wetland cells are underperforming?' 'Where should we focus treatment?' Our graph database links biosensor results with years of historical PDFs, spreadsheets, SCADA data, weather patterns, so every new data point compounds the platform's intelligence. It's not just faster monitoring; it's decision support operators have never had."*

**Key phrases to emphasize:**
- "plain English"
- "graph database"
- "compounds the platform's intelligence"
- "decision support operators have never had"

---

### **SCENE 4: THE ASK & TRACTION (1:05 - 1:28) - JEFF**

**Setting:** Back to office, leaning slightly forward (engagement energy)
**Camera:** Medium shot
**Energy:** Direct, clear ask for mentor support

**JEFF SCRIPT:**
*"We're in active conversations with CNRL, Imperial, and Pathways Alliance two operators managing 2/3rds of Alberta's tailings inventory. We're not selling a science experiment. We're offering the operational monitoring platform they'll need to move from containment to meeting new release standards. 

Our ask from CDL mentors: help us navigate these complex organizations to accelerate pilot commitments, and connect us to the strategic investors who understand why this regulatory forcing function makes Luminous an urgent opportunity, not a nice-to-have."*

**Key phrases to emphasize:**
- "CNRL, Imperial, and Suncor"
- "not selling a science experiment"
- "navigate these complex organizations"
- "urgent opportunity, not a nice-to-have"

---

### **SCENE 5: THE CLOSER (1:28 - 1:30) - JEFF OR ALL THREE**

**Setting:** Quick 3-shot of team together OR back to Jeff solo
**Camera:** Medium/wide shot if all three, medium if Jeff solo

**SCRIPT (JEFF or ALL THREE):**
*"Luminous BioSolutions: the integrated NA intelligence platform for addressing Alberta's Tailings challenge."*

## EDITING GUIDE (iMovie - Mac)

### **Step 1: Import Footage**
1. Open iMovie
2. Create New Project → Movie
3. Import all video clips (File → Import Media)

### **Step 2: Assemble Timeline**
1. Drag clips to timeline in order:
   - Jeff Scene 1 (0:00-0:20)
   - Jeff Scene 2a (0:20-0:25)
   - Shawn Scene 2b (0:25-0:35)
   - Jeff transition (0:35-0:45)
   - Greg Scene 3 (0:45-1:05)
   - Jeff Scene 4 (1:05-1:28)
   - Jeff/All Scene 5 (1:28-1:30)
2. Trim each clip to exact timing (use iMovie's "Clip Trimmer")

### **Step 3: Add Transitions**
1. Between scenes, add "Cross Dissolve" transition (0.5 seconds)
2. Keeps flow smooth between different settings

### **Step 4: Add Lower Thirds (Optional)**
1. When each person first appears, add text overlay:
   - "Jeff Violo, CEO & Co-Founder"
   - "Dr. Shawn Lewenza, CSO & Co-Founder"
   - "Greg Saunders, CTO & Co-Founder"
2. iMovie: Titles → Lower Third (3 seconds each)

### **Step 5: Add B-Roll (Optional)**
1. If you filmed B-roll, overlay using Picture-in-Picture OR cutaway
2. Examples:
   - During "1.4 trillion litres" → Show aerial tailings pond
   - During Shawn's section → Show biosensor glowing
   - During Greg's section → Show Confluent dashboard screen recording

### **Step 6: Audio Adjustments**
1. Normalize audio levels across all clips (so Jeff/Shawn/Greg have consistent volume)
2. iMovie: Select clip → Modify → Audio → Auto
3. If background noise, use "Reduce background noise" slider (50-75%)

## KEY MESSAGING HOOKS (Mentors Should Remember)

After watching, mentors should retain these 7 phrases:

1. **"1.4 trillion litres, 12-18 month regulatory timeline"** → Scale + urgency
2. **"24-hour results vs 6-8 week lab turnaround"** → Speed advantage
3. **"Peer-reviewed ACS Synthetic Biology, field-validated at Imperial Kearl"** → Credibility
4. **"Integrated NA intelligence platform"** → Positioning (not just sensors)
5. **"Compounding intelligence - every data point makes the platform smarter"** → Defensible moat
6. **"CNRL, Imperial, Suncor conversations"** → Traction with real operators
7. **"Not a science experiment - execution-ready"** → Differentiation from early-stage

## WHY THIS VIDEO WILL STAND OUT

**Most CDL videos fall into these traps:**
- ❌ Too much time on the problem (mentors already know the problem)
- ❌ Too technical (loses business-focused mentors)
- ❌ Vague traction claims ("in discussions with potential customers")
- ❌ No clear ask (mentors don't know how to help)

**Our video stands out because:**
- ✅ Opens with FORCING FUNCTION (regulatory urgency creates immediate need)
- ✅ Balances science credibility (Shawn) + platform depth (Greg) + commercial focus (Jeff)
- ✅ Names specific operators (CNRL, Imperial, Suncor) showing real traction
- ✅ Clear mentor asks (navigate organizations, accelerate pilots, investor intros)
- ✅ Positions as "execution-ready" not "interesting technology"

---

## QUESTIONS OR ISSUES?

**If you run into challenges:**
- Technical issues (filming/editing): Greg (platform expert, can troubleshoot Mac/iMovie)
- Script adjustments: Jeff (commercial messaging, can refine if needed)
- Scientific messaging: Shawn (ensure accuracy of peer-review claims)

**Backup Plan (If Filming Takes Too Long):**
- Option A: Film Jeff solo delivering full 90 seconds (less dynamic but faster)
- Option B: Screen recording with voiceover (Jeff narrates over slides/dashboard)
- Option C: Loom recording (simpler, but less polished)

---

## FINAL NOTES

**Remember:**
- CDL mentors see dozens of ventures - we need to be memorable
- 90 seconds is SHORT - every word counts
- Credibility (peer-reviewed, field-validated) + Urgency (regulatory timeline) + Traction (operator conversations) = mentor action
- The goal is NOT to explain everything, but to create curiosity and establish credibility so mentors WANT to help us

**This video should make mentors think:**
1. "This is urgent - regulatory timeline creates forcing function"
2. "This is credible - peer-reviewed science, field-validated"
3. "This is more than a sensor - integrated platform with data moat"
4. "This team executes - they're talking to the right operators already"
5. "I can help - I know someone at CNRL/Imperial/Suncor I should introduce them to"

**Let's make this count. Good luck with filming!**
