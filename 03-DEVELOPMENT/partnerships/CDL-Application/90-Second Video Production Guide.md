**If you have extra time and want to add polish:**
- **Greg's background:** Have Confluent dashboard visible on monitor behind you during filming
- **Simple graphics:** Add text overlays in iMovie for key stats ("1.4 trillion litres", "24-hour results", "12-18 months")

**Note:** Talking-head format with lower thirds is perfectly professional and time-efficient.

## EDITING GUIDE (iMovie - Mac)

### **Step 1: Import Footage**
1. Open iMovie
2. Create New Project → Movie
3. Import all video clips (File → Import Media)

### **Step 2: Assemble Timeline**
1. Drag clips to timeline in order:
   - Jeff Scene 1 (0:00-0:30)
   - Shawn Scene 2 (0:30-1:00)
   - Greg Scene 3 (1:00-1:30)
2. Trim each clip to exact timing (use iMovie's "Clip Trimmer")
3. Total runtime should be exactly 90 seconds (±2 seconds acceptable)

### **Step 3: Add Transitions**
1. Between scenes, add "Cross Dissolve" transition (0.5 seconds)
2. Keeps flow smooth between different settings

### **Step 4: Add Lower Thirds (Optional)**
1. When each person first appears, add text overlay:
   - "Jeff Violo, CEO & Co-Founder"
   - "Dr. Shawn Lewenza, CSO & Co-Founder"
   - "Greg Saunders, CTO & Co-Founder"
2. iMovie: Titles → Lower Third (3 seconds each)

### **Step 5: Add B-Roll (Optional)**
1. If you filmed B-roll, overlay using Picture-in-Picture OR cutaway
2. Examples:
   - During "1.4 trillion litres" → Show aerial tailings pond
   - During Shawn's section → Show biosensor glowing
   - During Greg's section → Show Confluent dashboard screen recording

### **Step 6: Audio Adjustments**
1. Normalize audio levels across all clips (so Jeff/Shawn/Greg have consistent volume)
2. iMovie: Select clip → Modify → Audio → Auto
3. If background noise, use "Reduce background noise" slider (50-75%)

### **Step 7: Export**
1. File → Share → File
2. Resolution: 1080p
3. Quality: High
4. Format: MP4
5. Save to desktop

**Final file should be:**
- 90 seconds runtime (±2 seconds acceptable)
- 1080p resolution
- MP4 format
- File size: ~100-200 MB

## WHY THIS VIDEO WILL STAND OUT

**Most CDL videos fall into these traps:**
- ❌ Too much time on the problem (mentors already know the problem)
- ❌ Too technical (loses business-focused mentors)
- ❌ Vague traction claims ("in discussions with potential customers")
- ❌ No clear ask (mentors don't know how to help)

**Our video stands out because:**
- ✅ Opens with FORCING FUNCTION (regulatory urgency creates immediate need)
- ✅ Balances science credibility (Shawn) + platform depth (Greg) + commercial focus (Jeff)
- ✅ Names specific operators (CNRL, Imperial, Suncor) showing real traction
- ✅ Clear mentor asks (navigate organizations, accelerate pilots, investor intros)
- ✅ Positions as "execution-ready" not "interesting technology"

---

## QUESTIONS OR ISSUES?

**If you run into challenges:**
- Technical issues (filming/editing): Greg (platform expert, can troubleshoot Mac/iMovie)
- Script adjustments: Jeff (commercial messaging, can refine if needed)
- Scientific messaging: Shawn (ensure accuracy of peer-review claims)

**Backup Plan (If Filming Takes Too Long):**
- Option A: Film Jeff solo delivering full 90 seconds (less dynamic but faster)
- Option B: Screen recording with voiceover (Jeff narrates over slides/dashboard)
- Option C: Loom recording (simpler, but less polished)

---

## FINAL NOTES

**Remember:**
- CDL mentors see dozens of ventures - we need to be memorable
- 90 seconds is SHORT - every word counts
- Credibility (peer-reviewed, field-validated) + Urgency (regulatory timeline) + Traction (operator conversations) = mentor action
- The goal is NOT to explain everything, but to create curiosity and establish credibility so mentors WANT to help us

**This video should make mentors think:**
1. "This is urgent - regulatory timeline creates forcing function"
2. "This is credible - peer-reviewed science, field-validated"
3. "This is more than a sensor - integrated platform with data moat"
4. "This team executes - they're talking to the right operators already"
5. "I can help - I know someone at CNRL/Imperial/Suncor I should introduce them to"

**Let's make this count. Good luck with filming!**
