## 5 STRATEGIC QUESTIONS FOR CDL MENTORS

### **QUESTION 1: Enterprise Sales Strategy - Navigating Complex Organizations**

**The Question:**
"Given the multi-layered decision-making at CNRL, Imperial, and Suncor, which organizational champion should we prioritize—VP Environmental, Tailings Management leads, or Innovation/Technology groups? And what's the most effective approach to accelerate pilot conversations from 'interesting technology' to 'committed budget' in organizations with 12-18 month procurement cycles?"

**Why You're Asking:**
- Shows you understand the complexity (not naive)
- Asks for specific tactical guidance (not philosophical advice)
- Mentors with operator experience can give names/paths

**Target Mentors:**
- **Steve Laut (CNRL Board Director)** - can provide CNRL-specific organizational insights
- Any mentor with oil sands operator background
- Enterprise sales experts who've sold into conservative industries

**What You're Listening For:**
- Specific titles/departments to target
- Red flags/landmines to avoid
- Timeline expectations (is 8 weeks to pilot realistic?)
- Introduction offers ("I can connect you to...")

### **QUESTION 2: Indigenous Engagement as Competitive Advantage**

**The Question:**
"We've established initial contact with Mikisew Cree First Nation consultants and understand their concerns about monitoring transparency and regulatory loopholes. How can we formalize this engagement into a differentiated go-to-market strategy that positions Luminous as the 'trusted third-party monitor' operators need for social license, without appearing to speak for or co-opt Indigenous concerns?"

**Why You're Asking:**
- Signals you're thinking beyond just technology
- Shows awareness of social license importance
- Asks for guidance on navigating sensitive positioning

**Target Mentors:**
- **Monique Simair (VP Science & Innovation, Integrated Sustainability)** - likely has Indigenous engagement experience
- Mentors with regulatory/community relations background
- Anyone who's navigated social license challenges in energy

**What You're Listening For:**
- How to formalize relationships without being extractive
- Whether this is truly differentiating or table stakes
- Specific language/framing that works (or doesn't)
- Connections to Indigenous business development networks

---

### **QUESTION 3: Pre-Seed Valuation & SAFE Structure**

**The Question:**
"As a bootstrapped deeptech company with peer-reviewed science and field validation but pre-revenue, what's a reasonable valuation cap and discount for our pre-seed SAFE? And should we prioritize 'smart money' strategic investors (potentially from operators or engineering firms) even at lower valuations, or optimize for best terms with financial angels?"

**Why You're Asking:**
- Shows financial sophistication (you understand trade-offs)
- Invites specific tactical advice mentors can answer
- Opens door to investor introductions

**Target Mentors:**
- **Matthew McGraw (Anthropocene Ventures)** - energy-focused VC, knows market
- Any mentor who's raised pre-seed for deeptech
- Angels who've invested at this stage

**What You're Listening For:**
- Specific valuation cap range ($5M? $8M? $10M?)
- Standard discount terms (15%? 20%?)
- Red flags in term sheets
- Investor introduction offers

**Follow-Up Questions to Have Ready:**
- "What traction milestones would justify a step-up in Series A valuation?"
- "Should we accept strategic investor board seat at this stage?"

---

### **QUESTION 4: Pilot-to-Contract Conversion Strategy**

**The Question:**
"What metrics and proof points from our initial paid pilots will be most compelling to convert operators from one-time pilot to multi-year monitoring contracts? Is it cost savings vs. HRMS, frequency of data generation, demonstrated remediation optimization, or regulatory compliance value—and how do we structure pilot agreements to set up contract expansion?"

**Why You're Asking:**
- Shows you're thinking about business model, not just landing pilots
- Forward-thinking (already planning for scale)
- Invites debate about what really drives procurement

**Target Mentors:**
- Mentors who've sold technology services to operators
- Anyone with energy/industrial sales background
- Operators who've bought monitoring technology

**What You're Listening For:**
- Which value driver matters most (cost? speed? compliance?)
- How to structure pilot agreements (success criteria, expansion clauses)
- Typical pilot-to-contract conversion rates in energy tech
- Pricing model guidance (per-sample? monthly retainer? annual contract?)

**Follow-Up Questions to Have Ready:**
- "Should we offer pilots at cost to accelerate adoption, or full pricing from day one?"
- "What contract length is standard for monitoring services?"

---

### **QUESTION 5: Strategic Partnership vs. Direct Sales**

**The Question:**
"We're in conversations with Stantec about integrating our technology into their remediation projects. Should we prioritize building channel partnerships with engineering consultants who have existing operator relationships, or focus on direct operator sales to control customer relationships and capture more value? What's worked in energy technology adoption?"

**Why You're Asking:**
- Classic strategic trade-off with no obvious answer
- Shows business model sophistication
- Invites perspectives from mentors with different backgrounds

**Target Mentors:**
- Anyone who's navigated channel vs. direct sales decisions
- Mentors with consulting firm backgrounds
- Operators (to understand if they prefer buying direct or through consultants)

**What You're Listening For:**
- "Why not both?" (and how to sequence)
- Whether partnerships dilute margins too much
- If consultants truly have procurement influence
- Examples of successful channel models in energy tech

**Follow-Up Questions to Have Ready:**
- "If we go channel route, how do we prevent becoming a commodity supplier?"
- "What revenue share is typical for consulting firm partnerships?"

## SESSION 1 CONVERSATION STRATEGY

### **Opening (First 5 Minutes):**
- Let Venture Leader introduce you

- Set tone: confident but humble, prepared but open to challenge

### **Middle (Next 45 Minutes):**
- Mentors will probe your venture description, objectives, challenges
- **Listen first, ask second** - let them identify gaps before you ask questions
- When you ask questions, tie them to mentor expertise
- Take notes on specific advice (shows respect, enables follow-up)

### **Closing (Final 10 Minutes):**
- Summarize key takeaways ("Here's what I heard...")
- Make **specific asks**: "Steve, could I follow up on that CNRL intro?"
- Offer value back: "Happy to share our Kearl validation data if useful"
- Thank mentors, get contact info for follow-up

## RED FLAGS TO AVOID

❌ **Don't:** Defend your approach when challenged - mentors are testing you
✅ **Do:** Say "That's a great point, tell me more about your concern"

❌ **Don't:** Ask questions with obvious answers you should know
✅ **Do:** Ask questions that show you've done homework but need expert insight

❌ **Don't:** Dominate the conversation or be defensive
✅ **Do:** Create space for mentors to debate/discuss - that's where value emerges

❌ **Don't:** Leave without specific next steps
✅ **Do:** End with clear actions and permission to follow up

---

## POST-SESSION FOLLOW-UP PLAN

**Within 24 Hours:**
- Send thank you email to Venture Leader + mentors who offered specific help
- Include 1-2 sentence recap of advice you're implementing
- Make any introduction requests explicit

**Within 1 Week:**
- Update venture strategy based on mentor feedback
- Execute on any "quick wins" mentors suggested
- Prepare progress update for Session 2

**Before Session 2:**
- Report back to mentors who helped: "You suggested X, here's what we did"
- This builds relationship and shows you're coachable/execute quickly

## ADDITIONAL NOTES

**Questions You Might Be Asked (Be Ready):**
1. "Why won't operators just wait for HRMS to get faster/cheaper?"
2. "What happens if AER never finalizes water release guidelines?"
3. "How do you prevent becoming a feature that Stantec/operators build in-house?"
4. "What's your defensibility beyond the biosensor patent?"
5. "Why should operators trust a startup with mission-critical monitoring?"

**Your Prep:**
- Practice answers to these out loud
- Have specific data points ready (correlation numbers, timeline comparisons, cost differentials)
- Know your financials cold (burn rate, runway, fundraising status)

**Good luck Thursday with your Venture Leader prep session!**
