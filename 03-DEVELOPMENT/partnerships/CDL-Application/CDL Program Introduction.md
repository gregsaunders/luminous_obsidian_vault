# CDL Program Introduction 2025/26

## Program Overview

This document covers the Creative Destruction Lab (CDL) Rockies program for the 2025/26 cohort, run through Haskayne School of Business at the University of Calgary.

---

## Key Expectations

- **Attendance**: Founders and relevant team members must attend all meetings. Session Days attendance is mandatory.
- **Program Structure**: CDL does not take equity or fees. This is a gift, so cooperation and openness from ventures is expected.
- **Confidentiality**: CDL does not sign NDAs. There is an inherent observability tradeoff.
- **Mentor Appreciation**: All mentors and scientists are volunteers. Showing appreciation and maintaining clear communication is critical and non-negotiable.
- **Participation Agreements**: Any new participants (even for one-off calls) must sign a Participation Agreement.

## Venture Documents

Venture Documents consist of 3 sections totaling 4 pages:

### 1. Venture Overview (2 pages)

- Venture Description & Vision
- Product & Customer
- Technical
- Financial
- Team

### 2. Venture Update (1 page)

- CDL Journey
- Proposed 3 Objectives
- CEO Update
- CDL Commentary
- Financing Update

### 3. Moderator Note (1 page)

- **Note**: Ventures do not have access to this page. Its purpose is to support Moderators in guiding Large Room Discussions (LRD).

### Best Practices for Completing Venture Documents

- Be specific (include metrics, numbers, dates, timelines, company names, etc.)
- Provide as much information as possible that you're willing to share with the CDL network (more is better)
- Be honest about your progress and challenges
- Respond promptly to your Venture Leader's follow-up questions
- Strong Venture Documents increase your chances of success in the program
- Documents will be submitted to mentors regardless of completion status

### Venture Description Guidelines

**Critical Note**: This is often the first exposure CDL network members have to your venture. First impressions matter.

**Format** (no more than 3 lines, 3rd person):

- **Sentence 1**: Summary of what the company does, starting with venture name
- **Sentence 2**: Most notable point of differentiation in layman's terms
- **[Optional] Sentence 3**: What distinguishes the company

**Requirements**:

- Remove hyperbole
- Use 3rd person point of view
- Maximum 3 lines
