# CDL Mentor Meeting Summary - November 22, 2024

## Key Participants

- **Luminous team**: Jeff, Sean, Greg, Max
- **CDL Mentors**: Dave, Doug, Jocelyn, Terence, Dennis

---

## Core Message from Mentors

The mentors were direct: **stop thinking like academics and start thinking like a company**. The recurring theme was that Luminous needs to shift from proving the science works to proving the business case.

---

## Four Objectives Established

1. **Secure a commercial pilot** (not academic) with an oil sands operator
2. **Raise capital** to fund a 24-month execution plan
3. **Position Luminous attractively** to operators and investors
4. **Secure IP** from Athabasca University (added during meeting)

## Critical Feedback

**On the pitch:**

- Create a 2-3 line elevator pitch focused entirely on benefits, not technical features
- Explain value so a CEO with no tailings knowledge understands it
- The $260K savings calculation from the CNRL wetland reverse-engineering is the right approach—lead with quantifiable ROI
- Mentors need spoon-fed materials (one paragraph, one-pager) to make introductions

**On CNRL:**

- Jocelyn warned strongly: "CNRL is the hardest company to get money out of. Do not put all your eggs in one basket."
- Verbal commitments mean nothing—get everything in writing
- Budget cuts happen; they've seen signed agreements walked away from

**On IP:**

- No investor will write a check until IP ownership is resolved
- This is table stakes, not optional
- AU is apparently cooperative, but push for their timeline to match yours, not academic speed

**On pilot agreements:**

- Need a simple pilot agreement ready to sign—doesn't need to be perfect
- Must clearly state Luminous owns IP and data
- Watch for Material Transfer Agreements (MTAs) that auto-claim IP

---

## Mentor Offers

- **Dave**: Help with financials, pro forma, funding structure, investor conversations
- **Doug**: Review pilot agreements, MSA/MTA red flags, has Pathways Alliance CEO connection (Kendall Dilling)
- **Jocelyn**: Has Suncor contacts but needs materials to make intros; familiar with CNRL operations
- **Terence**: Operations perspective, science validation

---

## Communication Preferences

- **Email** for documents and action items
- **Text** for quick back-and-forth (most mentors preferred this over Slack)
- Slack notifications aren't reliable for most mentors

---

## Post-Meeting Co-Founder Discussion

Jeff and Sean had a candid debate about timeline realism:

- **Jeff's position**: Drive aggressively toward May pilot, use business pressure to accelerate institutional processes, parallel-path everything
- **Sean's position**: Academic/institutional timelines are real constraints; IP agreements and contracts take time regardless of business urgency

Max suggested the practical middle ground: whether linear or parallel, Luminous needs comprehensive materials ready (IP strategy with realistic timeline, financial analysis, implementation plan) to persuade decision-makers at each gate.

## Immediate Action Items

1. Create the one-paragraph pitch and one-pager for mentor distribution
2. Finalize IP timeline document with AU commitments
3. Build pro forma financials
4. Draft simple pilot agreement template
5. Engage BLG legal through CDL
6. Send mentors target company list for introductions
