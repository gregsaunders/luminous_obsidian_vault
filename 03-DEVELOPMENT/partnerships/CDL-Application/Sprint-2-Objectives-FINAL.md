# CDL Sprint 2 Objectives - Mentor Discussion Document

**Prepared for:** Nov 27 Mentor Call with Jocelyn McMinn
**Status:** Ready for validation
**Sprint Period:** Nov 21, 2025 - Feb 13, 2026 (Session 2)

## Current Progress Assessment

Before defining Sprint 2 deliverables, here's where we stand on each objective:

| Objective | Progress | Key Assets Complete |
|-----------|----------|---------------------|
| **Pilot Acquisition** | 60-70% | CNRL target identified, COSIA relationship (Ty Veness), TRL 8 validation, Lipsett test planning offer |
| **Commercial Infrastructure** | 80-90% | "Operational Intelligence" positioning, $260K ROI validated, executive summary, pitch deck outline |
| **Fundraise Readiness** | 85-90% | 24-month budget (needs tightening), valuation framework ($8M-$10M), cap table strategy, use of funds |

**Key Insight:** We're not starting from zero. Sprint 2 is about **closing gaps and securing commitments**, not building from scratch.

## OBJECTIVE 1: Secure CNRL Pilot for Q2 2026 Deployment

**Business Outcome:** Signed LOI or commitment from CNRL for paid pilot at Albian wetland site

### Sprint 2 Deliverables

| # | Task | Owner | Target Date | Status |
|---|------|-------|-------------|--------|
| 1.1 | Complete COSIA endorsement meeting with Ty Veness | Jeff | Week 1 (Nov 27) | 🟡 Scheduled |
| 1.2 | Schedule Mike Lipsett test planning session | Jeff | Week 2 | 🔴 Not started |
| 1.3 | Finalize pilot scope document (timeline, deliverables, budget) | Jeff/Greg | Week 4 | 🔴 Not started |

| 1.5 | Submit formal pilot proposal to CNRL | Jeff | Week 8 | 🔴 Not started |
| 1.6 | Secure LOI or verbal commitment from CNRL | Jeff | Week 10 | 🔴 Not started |

### Mentor Questions
- Is 10 weeks realistic to go from proposal to LOI with a major operator?
- Should we pursue parallel conversations with Suncor/Imperial as backup?
- How do we position ERA/AI matching as a "gift" to CNRL (they only pay 50%)?

## OBJECTIVE 2: Complete Commercial Execution Infrastructure

### Sprint 2 Deliverables

### Mentor Questions
- What's the typical operator decision timeline? Who are the key stakeholders (Ops, Environment, Procurement)?
- Should pricing be "cost-plus" (based on our costs) or "value-based" (% of $260K savings)?
- How do we handle the "free pilot" expectation from operators?

## OBJECTIVE 3: Achieve Fundraise-Ready Status

**Business Outcome:** Complete investor materials, validated budget, and active outreach to targets

### Sprint 2 Deliverables

| # | Task | Owner | Target Date | Status |
|---|------|-------|-------------|--------|

| 3.6 | Begin soft outreach to top 3-5 targets | Jeff | Week 8 | 🔴 Not started |

### Mentor Questions
- Does $8M-$10M pre-money valuation hold for TRL 8 cleantech with LOI but pre-revenue?
- Should we close pilot LOI before investor outreach, or run in parallel?
- Which CDL network investors should we prioritize?
