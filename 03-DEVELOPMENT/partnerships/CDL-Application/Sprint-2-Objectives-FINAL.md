# CDL Sprint 2 Objectives - Mentor Discussion Document

**Prepared for:** Nov 27 Mentor Call with Jocelyn McMinn
**Status:** Ready for validation
**Sprint Period:** Nov 21, 2025 - Feb 13, 2026 (Session 2)

---

## Current Progress Assessment

Before defining Sprint 2 deliverables, here's where we stand on each objective:

| Objective | Progress | Key Assets Complete |
|-----------|----------|---------------------|
| **Pilot Acquisition** | 60-70% | CNRL target identified, COSIA relationship (Ty Veness), TRL 8 validation, Lipsett test planning offer |
| **Commercial Infrastructure** | 85-90% | Strategic positioning framework, discovery scripts, Confluent value map, pilot proposal v1.4, zero-friction deployment model |
| **Fundraise Readiness** | 85-90% | Pitch deck near-complete, 24-month budget (needs tightening), valuation framework ($8M-$10M), cap table strategy |

**Key Insight:** We're not starting from zero. Sprint 2 is about **closing gaps and securing commitments**, not building from scratch.

**Critical Timeline:** We have between now and May 2026 to secure the pilot, finalize the schedule, and complete the delivery execution plan. Q2 is when water melts and pilot season begins.

## OBJECTIVE 1: Secure CNRL Pilot for Q2 2026 Deployment

**Business Outcome:** Signed LOI or commitment from CNRL for paid pilot at Albian wetland site

- Can you facilitate introductory meetings with these contacts?
- Is 10 weeks realistic to go from proposal to LOI with a major operator?
- How do we position ERA/AI matching as a benefit to CNRL (they only pay 50%)?
