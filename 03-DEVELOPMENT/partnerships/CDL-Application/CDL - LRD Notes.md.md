Alright, that's interesting. Mike Backus, you're the objective center. Anything else the room should know about Luminous and what do they need to do next?

You know, the company's developing this testing solution. There's really no question about who their target customers are, so they've got that going for them. The tech seems to be really well advanced and proven, so I think there's another tick box there. The other thing is the pending standards with the Alberta Energy Regulator on test and release of this. It's a massive tailwind potentially for them. Maybe a bit of a timing question, but that's a big tailwind. And I think you can just imagine how important the validation of water quality will be for releasing back into the environment. So this part of that process is going to be, I think, a really critical piece. They're filling a gap here right now in terms of being able to get quick, reliable, frequent feedback on the quality in order to optimize that. So I think there's probably a good opportunity there as a sales pitch.

So in terms of the objectives, first one is get in the door, get this pilot up and running. It's more of a Q2 land, but they definitely need to, over the next few months, lay the groundwork and secure that and advance that pilot. We did remove the second objective, which is really that once they're in a pilot, validate. So you'll see in a bit here how we took that out because that's really probably a Q2 post-pilot objective. And then they need some help and I think need to focus on how much capital is this going to take? What sort of funding strategy is going to be in place? So I think that's a reasonable objective over the next few months. And then I think Steve had a really good replacement for number two. So maybe I'll let him describe that one. Steve.

Yeah, we went with him in the small group. I think one of the opportunities, I'm not sure it's an opportunity yet, but I think it could be a big one. Is if you can use this data from your bacteria, start a feedback loop with the operations. So if they can use the quick testing to go to the upstream plants and say, change your chemicals, change your steam, heat, all those things, all the levers you've got to pull, to get the NAs down, then that would be something of very big interest to the operator.

Okay, so beyond being a regulatory asset for the new water release problem, you're saying there's actually an operating angle to this as well?

I think there's the potential to be there, yeah. And you can make out the data stuff, so you can sort of use the AI thing that you can plan for in real time.

I think I can just push on that a little bit. How fast would the operators need to learn? Do you think that the timing for the product would be right to give enough information to change the mix?

They would love to have it instantaneously. It takes them seven to 12 hours. That's enough time to change things. It's better than three months.

Okay, thank you for that. Thank you very much for that. Steve, I'm going to stick with you. How do they change that message now? Because right now they're on regulatory compliance, you're an operational asset. How do they change the compliance to an ROI message?

I think you should do it as an and, not an either or. You can do this and it can help you run your operations. How do we get people's interest to an operator? Get you in the door faster. I'll get you in the door faster, okay.

Patrick Elliott, this biosensor that they have, I'll take a bit longer so you can get your mic set up. Biosensor that they have has lab and field validation. What milestones, this idea about how do they, what do they need to show people to bring it in the door to get this pilot, to make these pilots happen faster? What technical scalability, because right now they're doing it in pilots, but they're moving into bigger tailwinds. What do they need to show in that direction to get people to put it on the larger talent?

Yeah, I think they're in a very fortunate position. They've got a bunch of regulatory tailwinds at them. They've got a customer that they're working with. Getting success with that customer and getting them satisfied with the results, that is really important. And then from there, if they can prove the value of it, I think scale will follow. We didn't talk about this readiness of the technology to scale, but it's my impression that it should scale fairly quickly. So I don't know that that's a barrier or a constraint on their business.

The one thing that we did talk about in our small group meeting, I'm just going to change to accent on it. Is, as these new regulatory processes come into fruition this summer, I think it's really important for you to start working with the regulator. You can see from the regulations that your technology should be accepted, but directly engaging with the regulator, I think is going to be really important. Get them comfortable with your technology. You don't want to sit on the sidelines and wait for something to happen to you. Get into their kitchen and start talking right away, and do it in partnership with your customer that you have right now.

Mike Lipschick. Super quickly. So in a previous life, I was head of Tailings Research for Suncor. I think this is extremely exciting, and an extended pilot to be able to validate the full range of conditions in which this needs to work is crucial for acceptance by both the regulator and operators, and I agree completely with everything that Steve and Patrick have said. Thank you for that.

Judy, you have a comment about the need for a commercially oriented CEO. Can you flesh that out a little bit, please?

Well, I'm presuming it's probably with yourself. I just noticed your structure, the three of you. And where that leads to as well as what opportunity do you see on oil sands? I mean, here, what are your thoughts to have this be a massive venture? And I, well, I know oil sands are massive. It's starting my career there.

Well, okay, I'm going to put a pin in that. That was a question I have for a bit later on. In fact, I'm going to go to this right now. Steve, are the Alberta oil sands enough for this to be massively scalable?

What's your definition of massive?

Whatever CDL has in its handbook, Steve.

I think the oil sands are big, they got a lot of tailings ponds. And if they could do the on-loading operational thing, it would be good. But after that, it would be tougher, and maybe be able to go into the mining and the minerals if they have similar issues, but I don't know if they do. So, it might be limited just to oil sands.

Okay, so then I want to move over to Mike Backus on this. You mentioned that the regulatory play is the tailwind, and that's probably what's opening some doors for them right now. If they do have to move out of oil and into mining and possibly into other jurisdictions. What are your thoughts about how do the chemistry and regulatory differences between those, maybe different markets, maybe different regulatory structures, affect their scaling outside of oil, out of the tailings industry?

Yeah, I think the regulatory side of it's probably quite similar. Like, if I'm just thinking about the Western Canadian oil and gas, or even more locally, the Alberta and the AER, like, release testing, release the water, wherever you're putting it is massively important. So, I think that's very transferable.

I agree with Judy, I think, brought it up. It's, you know, they've got a clear beachhead right now, and they need to hyper-focus on that, and get it in place, and then they can scale beyond that. In terms of, once we work through this capital plan and long-term strategic financing, like, if I'm an investor, I want to see how big and how broad this can go. Because there could be a, you don't want to have it too limited of a market, even though the oil sands producers are big. So, I don't think regulatory's the hurdle there in that tailwind, because probably they're already on the other side.

Okay, thank you. Steve, just to answer your question, I've been informed in my channel that this is technically massive, according to CDL standards. So, the Alberta tailings industry are technically massive. So, that's definitional for you.

Doug Beach, you have a question or comment?

Yeah, I was just going to say, one of the cool things, we've been hitting ventures about focus, this one is driven to focus. So, it's got kind of a key tailwind. I was just doing some looking to see if the approach to naphthenic acid would really translate anywhere. It doesn't. One of the things I like about what they're doing though, is if they can make the focus of getting into the workflow the way he mentioned in the small, our small group meeting, and can actually start creating and assimilating data, do that as a service around other workflow items of their testing, which they mentioned doing, they might be able to kind of Trojan horse their way into a front end process where they get to process a bunch of their other analytical data that's coming from their water testing and stuff, and maybe make this even a little bit bigger, so.

Okay. Doug?

I have two suggestions for you. On the regulated environments, I'd look into the OSPAR regulations for offshore Europe. I think naphthenic acid's probably going to show up there. I don't know if it's required, but I'd be really keen to find non-regulated ones. And the one I would probably look at, I don't know if you can apply yours to hydrocarbons beyond water, but the oil phase, but vacuum distillation units in the refineries. They are monitoring naphthenic acid for that, and it's a major issue. So, non-regulated, but you're dealing with a hydrocarbon phase now.

Thank you very much for that, Doug. And Jeff, I hate to tell you, I'll also run the clock on you. So, thank you for being in the room, and best of luck. This has been great. Thank you.

Okay, next up is ERODE AI. ERODE AI.
