## VENTURE OVERVIEW

### VENTURE DESCRIPTION

- Sentence 1: Summary of what company does, starting with name of venture.
- Sentence 2: Most notable point of differentiation captures venture's gist for an unfamiliar audience.
- [Optional Third sentence: Describe what distinguishes the company].

**General instructions:** 1) Remove hyperbole from statements. 2) Ensure 3rd person point of view. 3) Restrict to no more than 3 lines.

Luminous BioSolutions gives oil sands operators the process control they currently lack for water treatment. We provide a 24-hour, field-deployable biosensor for naphthenic acid quantification, replacing the 6-8 week wait for lab results. This near-term monitoring service generates immediate revenue and the proprietary data required to deploy our future bioaugmentation technology, creating the industry's first adaptive treatment platform.

### WHAT IS THE VISION FOR THE VENTURE IN THE NEXT 5-10 YEARS?

Highlight the commercialization roadmap and the massive scalability potential of your company in a nutshell (not more than 2-3 sentences).

Answer so far:

In 10 years, Luminous BioSolutions will enable a global transformation in industrial water remediation by making real-time, adaptive environmental management possible, thereby converting multibillion-dollar liabilities into sustainable reclaimed assets across resource sectors.

In 3 years, our platform will be the essential tool for operational monitoring, with recurring revenue from operators using our data to de-risk compliance and optimize treatment. By year 5, we will launch our bioaugmentation service, using our data moat to offer an integrated "test-and-treat" solution that transforms tailings ponds from a passive liability into an actively managed asset.

## PRODUCT & CUSTOMER OVERVIEW

### HOW DOES THE PRODUCT/SERVICE WORK?

Ensure simple language is used to describe how a single user/customer would use the venture's product/service. Where relevant, highlight platform/network considerations when considering a single customer is not the appropriate level of analysis. Please limit your answer to 2-3 sentences.

Answer so far:

Luminous BioSolutions Inc. is an integrated environmental remediation platform that leverages rapid bioluminescent biosensors, targeted nature‐based bioaugmentation, and a real‐time data analytics system to accelerate oil sands tailings pond reclamation.

### WHO IS THE IDEAL CUSTOMER, AND WHAT IS THE VALUE PROPOSITION FOR THAT CUSTOMER?

Describe the venture's ideal customers and how the venture's product/service meets ideal customers' needs, compared to existing offerings which meet those same needs. Quantify the value proposition, if possible. There would be room to outline the competition landscape/competitors in the next section. Please limit your answer to 2-3 sentences.

[Include additional quantifiable performance metrics if available.]

Answer so far:

For oil sands operators burdened by slow and costly environmental monitoring and remediation, Luminous BioSolutions delivers a platform that reduces NA detection time from weeks to minutes and enhances remediation performance through adaptive, data-driven bioaugmentation, thus de-risking liabilities and ensuring regulatory compliance. Please limit your answer to 2-3 sentences.


### WHO ARE THE VENTURE'S COMPETITORS, AND HOW DOES THE PRODUCT/SERVICE COMPARE TO THEIRS?

Describe other companies (or groups of companies) that currently meet the same customer needs. Be sure to consider both direct competitors and indirect substitutes. Please limit your answer to 2-3 sentences.

Answer so far:

Technology competitors include traditional laboratories relying on mass spectrometry for NA testing, while use-case competitors consist of standalone physical and chemical remediation solutions that operate without integrated monitoring. Luminous BioSolutions differentiates itself by providing an integrated platform where rapid biosensor data, targeted bioaugmentation, and a dynamic data feedback loop work in concert to deliver superior remediation outcomes.

  

## TECHNICAL OVERVIEW

### WHAT IS THE VENTURE'S CORE TECHNOLOGY, EXPLAINED IN NON-TECHNICAL TERMS?

Provide a description of the company's core technology that is understandable to a non-expert. General audience should understand the company's technology well enough to be able to easily explain it in their own words. Please limit your answer to 2-3 sentences.

Answer so far:

Our core technology is a dual-component system that combines genetically engineered bioluminescent biosensors for the rapid detection of naphthenic acids with an integrated data analytics platform that processes sensor outputs to guide and optimize remediation efforts.

### WHAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT DIMENSION OF TECHNICAL ADVANTAGE?

Ensure the answer here addresses the distinct advantage the venture has over its competitors that allows it to generate greater profits or retain more customers than similar companies. In other words, the venture's moat or secret sauce. Please limit your answer to 2-3 sentences.

Answer so far:

The rapid response, specificity, and high sensitivity of our engineered biosensors, which enables precise near real-time monitoring and adaptive remediation guidance, is the distinctive technical advantage that underpins our value proposition.  The biosensor is patent pending. 

With the announcement from the Government of Alberta committing to Water Release guidelines, and the forming of the OSMWSC, Oil Sands Operators will be rapidly moving from tailings ponds containment to preparing water to be released. This will start a large amount of activity regarding mass rapid  monitoring, and remediation strategies to prepare the water to meet the specified guidelines. This is where the volume of test results will need a data platform capable of accepting and analyzing the increase in sensor data.
  
[Clarify if additional technical advantages are protected by IP.]

### DOES THE VENTURE HAVE A WORKING PROTOTYPE/DEMO?

**Yes/No.** If "Yes" provide links to relevant videos/sites.

Answer so far:

Yes; a working prototype has been successfully demonstrated in field trials, including Imperial Oil's Kearl GROW Wetland Pilot, where its rapid detection capabilities and integrated data feedback loop were validated against conventional mass spectrometry analysis.

### WHAT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY DOES THE VENTURE HAVE, AND HOW IS IT PROTECTED?

- Do provide a link to any patents already filed and note their status (such as provisional, filed, approved, etc.)
- If there are no patents, explain the company's IP strategy briefly by choosing one of the below options:
  - "The venture is keeping its algorithms as trade secret"
  - "Freedom to operate search completed [INSERT DATE], no conflicting IP"
  - "Founders have disclosed the invention to X University and are in the process of having the IP assigned to the Venture"
Answer so far:

Luminous BioSolutions has filed multiple patent applications—including filings in Canada (CA425411833), the United States (US442710675), and an international application (WO2023039675)—covering both the bioluminescent sensor technology and the method of integrating real-time data for remediation; the process for IP assignment to the venture is currently underway.
