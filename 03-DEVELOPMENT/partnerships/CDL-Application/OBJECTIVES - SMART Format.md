**1. Customer/Market Objective:** Execute 2 paid pilot deployments with major oil sands operators generating $150K combined revenue by June 2026, with at least one operator committing to expanded deployment or annual monitoring contract.

- **Specific:** 2 paid pilots with CNRL, Imperial, or Suncor; $150K revenue; 1 contract commitment
- **Measurable:** Signed pilot agreements, invoiced revenue, documented contract expansion
- **Achievable:** CDL mentor introductions accelerate access; preliminary conversations already initiated
- **Realistic:** 8-month timeline aligns with condensed procurement cycles for pilot projects
- **Timely:** June 2026 (CDL graduation) provides proof of commercial viability for Series A investors

**2. Product/Technical Objective:** Demonstrate operational reliability across 500+ field samples during pilot deployments, achieving consistent 24-48 hour turnaround with documented correlation to HRMS, and publish Kearl Wetland validation study by April 2026.

- **Specific:** 500+ samples processed; <48hr turnaround; peer-reviewed publication
- **Measurable:** Sample logs, turnaround time data, published paper in peer-reviewed journal
- **Achievable:** Biosensor technology validated in lab; Kearl data collection complete
- **Realistic:** 2 pilots over 4-5 months generates 500+ samples; paper submission Q1 2026
- **Timely:** April 2026 publication provides third-party validation before Series A discussions

**3. Fundraising/Partnership Objective:** Close $1.5M pre-seed round (SAFE structure) by March 2026 from energy-focused angels, VCs, and ideally strategic investment from operator or engineering firm, plus secure $200K minimum in non-dilutive funding from Alberta Innovates/ERA.

- **Specific:** $1.5M SAFE + $200K grants; strategic investor participation preferred
- **Measurable:** Closed funding tranches, executed SAFE agreements, awarded grant contracts
- **Achievable:** CDL network provides investor access; Alberta Innovates/ERA applications in progress
- **Realistic:** 5-month timeline aligns with pre-seed fundraising cycles; pilot traction de-risks investment
- **Timely:** March 2026 close provides 18-24 month runway to execute pilots and prepare Series A
