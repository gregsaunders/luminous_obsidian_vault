# CDL-Rockies Admissions FAQ

## **1. What happens after the interview?**

Ventures are ranked and invited to the next stage of the admission process based on both their application and interview scores. The CDL team reviews all data, including the venture's stage of development, industry focus, market potential, and how well the CDL program can accelerate the venture's growth. The goal is to ensure strong alignment between admitted ventures and the expertise of the mentors to optimize the experience.

If your venture is selected for the next stage, you must complete a 30-minute virtual technical assessment with a CDL Scientist before September 23, 2025.

## **2. Who are CDL Scientists?**

CDL Scientists are part of the CDL-Rockies' mentor group and provide technical expertise and reviews of venture technologies.

## **3. Why does CDL require a technical assessment?**

CDL-Rockies requires all participating ventures to complete a technical assessment before being admitted into the program. The information from the assessment is used to:

- Evaluate the venture's technical quality.
    
- Provide CDL Mentors with a broad understanding of the technical aspects of the venture before Session 1.
    

The information gathered is shared with all CDL Mentors. Highlighting milestones and technical risks gives mentors an accurate picture of your business and helps them identify how they can best help you.

**Please note:** Founders will not receive a copy of the assessment.

## **4. Who should attend the technical assessment?**

The founding members, including the Chief Technical Officer or a similar role, should represent your venture during the technical assessment. A CDL team member will also attend to ensure consistency and answer program-related questions.

## **5. What information is provided to the scientist before the assessment?**

CDL Scientists receive a condensed version of your application and any supplemental information you provide when booking the interview. It is beneficial to your company to provide any supplemental information that may help with the assessment of your technology before your meeting.

## **6. What will be discussed during the technical assessment?**

CDL Scientists focus on the science and/or technology of the venture. Topics you might discuss include, but are not limited to:

- Technical validity 
    
- Technical team 
    
- Risk identification 
    
- Growth evaluation 
    

**Please note:** A CDL Scientist has the discretion to recommend a second assessment with another scientist for a deeper understanding of your technology. If this happens, a CDL team member will notify you of the next steps.

## **7. How are ventures and scientists matched?**

The CDL-Rockies team works closely with CDL Scientists to match relevant skills and expertise for the technical assessments.

## **8. Will CDL sign my NDA?**

No. CDL staff and mentors, including scientists, do not enter into NDAs. However, all CDL Mentors agree to the CDL Mentor Charter, which outlines their expected conduct. Since the program is focused on mentorship, you are not required to disclose information about unique elements of your technology. However, providing full information to the CDL Scientist increases their ability to offer meaningful advice and guidance.

## **9. What if I decline the technical assessment?**

The assessment is a mandatory step in the admission process. If you decline, you must email the CDL team member who sent your interview offer, and your venture will be removed from consideration for the 2025/26 cohort.

## **10. What happens after the technical assessment?**

Full admission to the CDL program depends on completing the technical assessment and the overall evaluation of your venture. This ensures that ventures will benefit from the program and helps the team provide the correct mentor experience and industry focus. You will be notified of the decision no later than September 30, 2025. Successful ventures will receive an email offer to participate in the 2025/26 cohort , and acceptance is confirmed upon completion of a Participation Agreement.
