## üìä KEY TALKING POINTS FOR THURSDAY

### What's Going Well (Be Ready to Discuss):
1. **Kearl validation** - High correlation with Orbitrap Mass Spec (conservative language until papers published)
2. **Customer conversations** - Active with CNRL, Suncor, Imperial; partnership with Stantec
3. **Indigenous engagement** - Mikisew Cree First Nation contacts established
4. **Regulatory timing** - OSMWSC Sept 2025 recommendations create urgency

### Biggest Challenges (Be Ready to Discuss):
1. **Enterprise sales complexity** - Multi-layered organizations, unclear buying processes
2. **Operator risk aversion** - May default to containment if AER delays release guidelines
3. **Pre-seed fundraising** - Need investor access who understand deeptech pre-revenue dynamics

### Strategic Positioning:
- **"AI-Native" not "AI-Powered"** - Confluent designed from inception to leverage LLMs
- **"Complement, not replace"** - HRMS remains gold standard, we provide operational layer
- **"Three-Tier Strategy"** - HRMS (compliance) + Biosensor (operations) + Confluent (intelligence)
