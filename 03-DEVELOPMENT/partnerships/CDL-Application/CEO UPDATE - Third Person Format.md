## CEO UPDATE

### What is going well? (in 3 bullet points)

• **Field validation exceeding expectations:** The Kearl Wetland pilot demonstrates high correlation between Luminous's biosensor and Orbitrap Mass Spec on real OSPW samples. This third-party validation at Imperial's site proves the technology works under actual field conditions, with results publication expected by year-end—providing the scientific credibility needed for conservative oil sands operators.

• **Strategic conversations progressing with all three target customers:** The company has active discussions with CNRL, and preliminary engagement with Pathways Alliance, Suncor, and Imperial, plus productive partnership conversations with Stantec for technology integration into remediation projects. A former Imperial tailings water specialist is providing insider perspective on operator decision-making processes.

• **Regulatory tailwind strengthening market timing:** September 2025 OSMWSC recommendations explicitly require operators to demonstrate technology transparency to Indigenous communities—positioning Luminous's platform as essential compliance infrastructure. The company's proactive engagement with Mikisew Cree First Nation (attending their water release guidelines presentation, establishing consulting contacts) validates this opportunity: their concerns about regulatory loopholes and operator trust gaps are precisely what Luminous's independent, auditable monitoring framework addresses, creating social license advantage for operator partners.

### What are the biggest challenges? (in 3 bullet points)

• **Navigating complex enterprise sales cycles to reach decision-makers:** Oil sands operators have multi-layered organizations with unclear buying processes. The company needs mentor guidance to identify the right champions (VP Environmental? Tailings Management? Innovation leads?) and accelerate access to executives with budget authority who understand the urgency of the monitoring gap Luminous solves.

• **Operator risk aversion despite regulatory pressure:** Despite OSMWSC mandates and $30B+ liability, operators may default to containment strategy if they doubt AER will finalize water release guidelines. Luminous needs help framing its value proposition to show immediate operational benefits (process optimization, cost reduction) independent of release timeline, plus credibility signals that overcome "wait and see" inertia.

• **Pre-seed fundraising without established revenue or customer logos:** Deeptech companies with long enterprise sales cycles face investor skepticism pre-revenue. The company needs CDL network access to energy-focused investors who understand this market's dynamics and can evaluate Luminous's technology de-risking (peer-reviewed science, field validation, regulatory alignment) as sufficient traction, plus guidance on appropriate valuation and SAFE structuring for this stage.
