## VENTURE DESCRIPTION

[Venture description from the Venture Overview Document] 

Oil sands operators need both HRMS accuracy AND high-frequency operational monitoring, but until now, they only had the former. Luminous BioSolutions provides the missing capability: rapid, affordable biosensor screening (24 hours vs. 6-8 weeks) integrated with a data platform that delivers real-time remediation visibility. As the industry shifts from containment to water release, we transform expensive, infrequent data into continuous process control.

## CDL JOURNEY

### Session 1

**Milestone 1:** Secure warm introductions to decision-makers at CNRL, Imperial, and Suncor through CDL mentor network (targeting VP-level Environmental/Tailings Management)

**Milestone 2:** Complete pre-seed fundraising strategy with CDL mentor guidance, finalize SAFE terms, valuation framework, and investor target list for $1.5M raise

**Milestone 3:** Validate go-to-market positioning through 3 structured customer discovery interviews with oil sands operators to refine value proposition and identify pilot entry points
 
### Session 2

**Milestone 1:** Secure committed paid pilot with at least one major operator (CNRL, Imperial, or Suncor) for field deployment

**Milestone 2:** Close first $500K of pre-seed funding (targeting energy-focused angels and strategic investors from CDL network)

**Milestone 3:** Complete Kearl Wetland validation paper submission demonstrating biosensor correlation to Orbitrap Mass Spec
### Session 3

**Milestone 1:** Deploy pilot at first customer site with active data collection and weekly reporting through Confluent platform

**Milestone 2:** Close remaining $1M of $1.5M pre-seed round, achieving 18-24 month runway

**Milestone 3:** Establish partnership framework with Stantec or similar engineering consultant for technology integration into remediation projects
### Session 4

**Milestone 1:** Demonstrate quantifiable pilot results (X% improvement in monitoring frequency, Y% cost reduction vs. HRMS, documented remediation optimization)

**Milestone 2:** Secure second paid customer or expand pilot scope with initial customer, validating repeatable sales motion

**Milestone 3:** Complete Series A readiness package (data room, financial model, pitch deck) positioning Luminous for $5-8M raise to scale operations across multiple sites

## PROPOSED 3 OBJECTIVES

1. **Objective 1:** Execute 2 paid pilot deployments with major oil sands operators (minimum $150K combined revenue) by CDL graduation (June 2026), with at least one operator committing to expanded deployment or annual monitoring contract. **Why Critical:** Pilots with CNRL, Imperial, or Suncor validate product-market fit in a risk-averse industry and create reference customers that unlock broader market access. Early revenue demonstrates commercial viability to investors.
2. **Objective 2:** Demonstrate operational reliability across 500+ field samples during pilot deployments, achieving consistent results within 24-48 hours and documented correlation to HRMS, with published Kearl Wetland validation study by April 2026. **Why Critical:** Oil sands operators will only adopt technology proven under harsh field conditions (extreme salinity, complex matrices, temperature variability). Field performance data de-risks technology for broader adoption and strengthens regulatory positioning with AER.
   **CDL Resources Needed:**
   - Technical mentors with oil sands operations experience to refine deployment protocols
- Connections to environmental engineering consultants (beyond Stantec) for validation partnerships
- Guidance on regulatory pathways for biosensor acceptance as compliance monitoring tool

1. **Objective 3:** Close $1.5M pre-seed round by March 2026 (SAFE structure) from combination of angel investors, energy-focused VCs, and ideally strategic investment from oil sands operator or engineering firm, plus secure non-dilutive funding (minimum $200K from Alberta Innovates/ERA). **Why Critical:** 18-24 month runway enables pilot execution, team expansion (microbiologist, developers), and Series A preparation without fundraising distraction. Strategic investor brings credibility, customer access, and industry expertise.
   **CDL Resources Needed:**
- Introductions to energy-focused investors (Anthropocene Ventures/Matthew McGraw, cleantech angels)
- Mentor guidance on SAFE structuring, valuation positioning for pre-revenue deeptech
- Support navigating Alberta Innovates and ERA grant processes
- Facilitation of strategic investment conversations with operators or Pathways Alliance

## CEO UPDATE

### What is going well? (in 3 bullet points)
 
 - **Field validation exceeding expectations:** Kearl Wetland pilot demonstrates high correlation between our biosensor and Orbitrap Mass Spec on real OSPW samples. This third-party validation at Imperial's site proves our technology works under actual field conditions, with results publication expected by year end, providing the scientific credibility needed for conservative oil sands operators.

- **Strategic conversations progressing with all three target customers:** Discussions with CNRL, and preliminary engagement with Pathways Alliance, Suncor and  Imperial, plus productive partnership conversations with Stantec for technology integration into remediation projects. Former Imperial tailings water specialist providing insider perspective on operator decision-making processes.

-  **Regulatory tailwind strengthening our market timing:** September 2025 OSMWSC recommendations explicitly require operators to demonstrate technology transparency to Indigenous communities—positioning our platform as essential compliance infrastructure. Our proactive engagement with Mikisew Cree First Nation (attending their water release guidelines presentation, establishing consulting contacts) validates this opportunity: their concerns about regulatory loopholes and operator trust gaps are precisely what our independent, auditable monitoring framework addresses, creating social license advantage for operator partners.
### What are the biggest challenges? (in 3 bullet points)

-  **Navigating complex enterprise sales cycles to reach decision-makers:** Oil sands operators have multi-layered organizations with unclear buying processes. We need mentor guidance to identify the right champions (VP Environmental? Tailings Management? Innovation leads?) and accelerate access to executives with budget authority who understand the urgency of the monitoring gap we solve.

 - **Operator risk aversion despite regulatory pressure:** Despite OSMWSC mandates and $30B+ liability, operators may default to containment strategy if they doubt AER will finalize water release guidelines. We need help framing our value proposition to show immediate operational benefits (process optimization, cost reduction) independent of release timeline, plus credibility signals that overcome "wait and see" inertia.

- **Pre-seed fundraising without established revenue or customer logos:** Tech companies with long enterprise sales cycles face investor skepticism pre-revenue. We need CDL network access to energy-focused investors who understand this market's dynamics and can evaluate our technology de-risking (peer-reviewed science, field validation, regulatory alignment) as sufficient traction, plus guidance on appropriate valuation and SAFE structuring for our stage.
