## VENTURE DESCRIPTION

[Venture description from the Venture Overview Document] 

Oil sands operators need both HRMS accuracy AND high-frequency operational monitoring, but until now, they only had the former. Luminous BioSolutions provides the missing capability: rapid, affordable biosensor screening (24 hours vs. 6-8 weeks) integrated with a data platform that delivers real-time remediation visibility. As the industry shifts from containment to water release, we transform expensive, infrequent data into continuous process control.
