### Part 1: Deliverables from your Chief Scientist (Dr. Shawn Lewenza)

To win the "Specificity Showdown," we need data that kills the skepticism dead. We cannot just _say_ it works; we must show the flat line.

**Request these specific data sets/graphs from Dr. Lewenza:**

1. **The "Humic/Fulvic Challenge" Graph:**
    
    - **Experiment:** Run the `marR-lux` and `atuA-lux` biosensors against pure Humic and Fulvic Acid standards at concentrations typical of OSPW.
        
    - **Desired Output:** A graph showing a flat line (no luminescence) for Humics/Fulvics, overlaid with a sharp spike for Naphthenic Acids.
        
    - **Why:** This visual proves the "Comparative Analysis" argument that FTIR fails (because it sees C=O bonds in humics), but Luminous succeeds.
        
2. **The "False Positive" Correction Study:**
    
    - **Experiment:** Take a "clean" natural water sample (high organics, low toxicity). Measure it with FTIR (which should show a false positive "NAFC" reading) and the Biosensor (which should show "Non-Detect").
        
    - **Why:** This proves the "Dump FTIR" argument. You show that FTIR forces engineers to treat water that is actually safe.
        
3. **The "Matrix Inhibition" Stress Test:**
    
    - **Experiment:** The comparative analysis flagged "matrix inhibition" (e.g., salt/metals killing the bacteria) as a risk. We need data showing the biosensor still functions at high salinity/pH, or the specific dilution protocol that overcomes this without losing sensitivity.
        
    - **Why:** Cynics will ask, "Will the salt kill your bugs?" You need the answer ready.
