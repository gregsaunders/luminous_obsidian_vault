# Luminous NAFC Worksh Strategy Context

## 1. Core Identity
* **Company:** Luminous BioSolutions.
* **Product:** Whole-cell bacterial biosensors (`marR-lux`, `atuA-lux`) for monitoring Naphthenic Acids (NAs) in Oil Sands Process-Affected Water (OSPW).
* **Tone:** "Cynical Scientist." Honest, data-driven, confident Canadian. No marketing spin. We sell process optimization, not just "tests."

## 2. The Problem (The "Trap")
* **The Compliance Trap:** Industry uses "Total NAs" (a blunt metric) to measure toxicity.
* **The Resolution Gap:**
    * [cite_start]**HRMS (Tier 3):** Accurate but too slow (60 days)[cite: 1164]. "The Coroner."
    * **FTIR (Tier 1):** Fast but inaccurate. [cite_start]It confuses safe Humic/Fulvic acids with toxic NAs. "The Smoke Alarm that rings when you burn toast."

## 3. The Luminous Solution
* **The Pivot:** We are replacing FTIR, not just augmenting it. We offer **High-Frequency, Geo-Tagged Toxicity Mapping.**
* **The Tech:**
    * **Specificity:** Unlike FTIR, we do *not* react to biogenic Humics/Fulvics (Validation in progress).
    * [cite_start]**Throughput:** 96-well microplate format allows high-volume screening[cite: 869].
    * [cite_start]**Context Engine:** We correlate toxicity data with operational variables (flow, temp, depth) to optimize treatment, saving $100k+/yr[cite: 1182].

## 4. Strategic Positioning
* **Tier 1 & 2 Combined:** Dump FTIR. Use Luminous Biosensors for routine, high-resolution operational monitoring.
* [cite_start]**Tier 3:** Keep HRMS only for final regulatory compliance (The Coroner)[cite: 344].
* **Key Value:** We stop operators from treating safe water (false positives from FTIR) and catch toxic events in real-time.

## 5. Current Status (Updated Dec 2025)
* **Specificity Data:** Positive preliminary results (ignores Humics). Finalizing graphs.
* [cite_start]**Workshops:** Targeting the "NAFC Workshop" group who identified "scalability" and "sample prep" as key pains[cite: 64, 75].
* [cite_start]**Validation:** TRL 8, validated at Imperial Kearl[cite: 1171].

## 6. Forbidden Actions
* Do not overpromise on regulatory acceptance (we are an operational tool first).
* Do not use "salesy" adjectives. [cite_start]Stick to the data (r=0.96 correlation to Orbitrap)[cite: 1696].
