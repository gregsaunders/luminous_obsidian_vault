# PROJECT ANTIGRAVITY: Luminous BioSolutions Strategy Context
**Last Updated:** December 6, 2025

## 1. Core Identity
* **Company:** Luminous BioSolutions.
* **Product:** Whole-cell bacterial biosensors (`marR-lux`, `atuA-lux`) for monitoring Naphthenic Acids (NAs) in Oil Sands Process-Affected Water (OSPW).
* **Tone:** "Cynical Scientist." Honest, data-driven, confident Canadian. We sell process optimization, not just "tests."

## 2. The Problem (The "Trap")
* **The Compliance Trap:** Industry uses "Total NAs" (a blunt metric) to measure toxicity.
* **The Resolution Gap:**
    * **HRMS (Tier 3):** Accurate but too slow (60 days). "The Coroner."
    * **FTIR (Tier 1):** Fast but inaccurate. It confuses safe Humic/Fulvic acids with toxic NAs. "The Smoke Alarm."
* **The Prep Bottleneck:** Industry is paralyzed by extraction debates (SPE vs. LLE). [cite_start]The NAFC Workshop rated Sample Prep as the #1 source of error.

## 3. The Luminous Solution & Strategic Pivot
* **The Pivot:** We are moving from "Testing" to **"Operational Optimization."**
* **The Tech:**
    * **Specificity:** Unlike FTIR, we do *not* react to biogenic Humics/Fulvics (Validation in progress). We offer the Speed of FTIR with the Specificity of Mass Spec.
    * **Minimal Prep:** We bypass the complex extraction debate entirely (Direct testing/Minimal Prep).
    * **Context Engine:** We correlate toxicity data with operational variables (flow, temp, depth) to optimize treatment, saving $100k+/yr (Kearl Pilot).

## 4. Market Validation (NAFC Workshop Report)
* [cite_start]**The "Ask":** The industry explicitly requested a **"Tiered Monitoring Approach"**  [cite_start]and **"Scalable Screening"**.
* **The Fit:** Luminous is the missing "Tier 1/Tier 2" link.
* **The Opportunity:** Biosensors were rated low on familiarity (3/11) and expertise required (1.8). We have the opportunity to shock the market with high-fidelity data they don't expect from a "simple" tool.

## 5. Execution Plan (Dec 2025)
* **Data Deliverables (Dr. Lewenza):**
    1.  **Specificity Graph:** Flatline response to Humics vs. Spike for NAs.
    2.  **Matrix Stress Test:** Proof of robustness in high salinity.
    3.  **Strain Selection:** Finalizing the "Standard Kit" (likely `marR`/`atuA`).
* **Demo (Greg/Shawn):** Ingesting Kearl data to visualize the "Context Engine" value prop.
* **Outreach:**
    * **Internal:** Aligning technical team on the "Anti-Extraction" and "Specificity" narratives.
    * **External:** Presenting data to Industry (Operators + Pathways) as the answer to the Workshop's gaps.

## 6. Forbidden Actions
* Do not overpromise on regulatory acceptance (we are an operational tool first).
* Do not use "salesy" adjectives. Stick to the data (r=0.96 correlation to Orbitrap).
* Do not sell "Biosensors" as a standalone widget; sell the **Insight/Optimization** they provide.
