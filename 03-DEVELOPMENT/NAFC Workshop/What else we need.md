### What have you missed?

1. **The Economic Model (ROI of Dumping FTIR):**
    
    - You are suggesting they do _more_ testing (high frequency/geo-tagged) with Luminous than they did with FTIR.
        
    - _Risk:_ Even if your per-test cost is lower, doing 100x more tests might look expensive on a budget sheet.
        
    - _Fix:_ You need a simple calculator. "Cost of treating clean water (due to FTIR false positive) vs. Cost of Luminous Monitoring." The savings come from _Chemical/Energy savings_ in treatment, not just lab fees.
        
2. **The "Chain of Custody" for Geo-Tagging:**
    
    - If you are proposing "Geo-Tagged" data, how is that physically handled? Do you have a GPS-linked sampling wand? An app? Or is it manual?
        
    - _Recommendation:_ Be clear on the _workflow_ of how a sample gets from "Pond Coordinate X" to "Heat Map Y."
