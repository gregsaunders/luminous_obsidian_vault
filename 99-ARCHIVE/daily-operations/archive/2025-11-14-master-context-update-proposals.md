**Session:** CDL Sprint 2 Mentor & MBA Prep
**Date:** 2025-11-14
**For Review:** Next Master Context update cycle

## SECTION 8: CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT LOG - PROPOSED ADDITIONS

### [2025-11-14] Learned Today: Jeff's Email Communication Style

**What we learned:**
Jeff's email tone differs significantly from his warm relationship-building approach in other contexts. His professional emails are direct, concise, and avoid excessive flattery.

**Characteristics:**
- ✅ Direct language ("great feedback" not "incredible feedback")
- ✅ Professional appreciation without gushing (thank once, not repeatedly)
- ✅ Businesslike closing ("Thanks again for your support")
- ✅ No signature fluff (name, title, phone only)
- ✅ Uses "~" for approximate numbers (shows realistic, not overprecise thinking)
- ❌ Avoid superlatives ("transformative," "incredible," "excited," "looking forward")

**Context:**
- This is DIFFERENT from warm relationship-building tone (Oct 31 session with Mark, Ty, Theo, etc.)
- Email context = more professional/direct
- Relationship-building context = warmer but still humble confidence

**Example Revision:**
- **My draft:** "Thank you all for the incredible feedback during Session 1—the guidance has been transformative for how we're thinking about the next 12 weeks."
- **Jeff's revision:** "Thank you all for the great feedback during Session 1, the guidance helped us refocus how we're thinking about the next 12 weeks."

**Where this should go:** Section 5 (Working Preferences) - add "Email Communication Style" subsection noting context-dependent tone

### [2025-11-14] Learned Today: Strategic Sequencing for Stakeholder Alignment

**What we learned:**
When managing multiple stakeholders with hierarchy, sequence matters: Lead stakeholder validates first, THEN bring full group together.

**CDL Example:**
1. ✅ Jocelyn (Lead Mentor) reviews objectives first (Nov 27)
2. ✅ After Jocelyn validates, send Doodle poll for full mentor kickoff
3. ❌ DON'T send full team kickoff before Lead Mentor validates (risks rework)

**Why this works:**
- Lead stakeholder has authority to course-correct early
- Prevents wasted time if major revisions needed
- Shows respect for leadership structure
- Full team sees consensus, not debate

**Universal applicability:**
- Board advisor relationships (advisor validates → board reviews)
- Investor introductions (lead investor validates → syndicate introduced)
- Partnership discussions (champion validates internally → decision-makers briefed)

**Where this should go:** Section 2.4 or Section 5 - add "Stakeholder Alignment Sequencing" note

---

### [2025-11-14] Learned Today: Collaborative vs. Directive Partnership Framing

**What we learned:**
When engaging high-value partners (MBA students, advisors, consultants), collaborative framing yields better results than directive task assignment.

**Max Zhang Example:**
- ❌ **Directive approach:** "Here's the project we need you to do"
- ✅ **Collaborative approach:** "Here are three options based on your expertise. Which excites you? What ideas do we haven't thought of? What skills do you want to develop?"

**Why this works:**
- Positions partner as expert (not task executor)
- Invites their strategic thinking (not just labor)
- Creates mutual value (not transactional)
- Increases engagement and quality

**Jeff's Direction:**
"I want this to be a collaborative process. I want to see what Max wants to do, what ideas he has, and the best expression of his talents."

**Consistency with Oct 31 Session:**
- Same philosophy as Ty Vaness email revision ("too aggressive" → humble scientist approach)
- Relationship-building > transaction
- Let them solve problems (positions them as experts)

**Where this should go:** Section 2.3 (Tone Standards) or Section 5 (Working Preferences) - add "Partnership Framing" subsection

---

### [2025-11-14] Learned Today: Relationship Leverage Ecosystem Mapping

**What we learned:**
When identifying stakeholder leverage opportunities, think ECOSYSTEM not just direct customers.

**Evolution:**
- **Initial scope:** "Identify relevant Oil Sands relationships we can leverage"
- **Jeff's instinct:** "Maybe adjacent industry relationships?"
- **Expanded scope:** "Identify relevant relationships we can leverage (operators, engineering firms, regulatory contacts, funding sources)"

**Full Ecosystem Categories:**
1. **Oil Sands Operators** - Pilot customers (CNRL, Suncor, Imperial)
2. **Engineering/Consulting Firms** - Partnership opportunities (Stantec, Integrated Sustainability, WSP, AECOM)
3. **Regulatory Contacts** - Proactive engagement (AER, Indigenous consultation leads)
4. **Non-Dilutive Funding** - Capital sources (Alberta Innovates, NRC IRAP, COSIA, Emissions Reduction Alberta)
5. **Adjacent Industries** - Expansion opportunities (offshore oil & gas Europe, mining, refinery VDUs)
6. **Investor Networks** - Equity capital (VCs, angels, cleantech funds)

**Why this matters:**
- Mentors may not have operator connections but DO have regulatory/funding/partnership connections
- Asking narrow question = missing leverage opportunities
- Broader framing = captures all relationship value

**Where this should go:** Section 4 (Document Portfolio Guide) or new "Stakeholder Ecosystem" section - map relationship types and leverage strategies

### [2025-11-14] Should Add: CDL Program Context & Structure

**Missing element discovered:**
Master Context has no CDL program information, which is now central to company strategy for next 12 weeks (Sprint 2).

**Recommendation:**
Add to Section 2.1 (Current State):

**CDL-Rockies Energy 2025/26 Program:**
- **Status:** Passed Session 1 (Nov 7, 2025), proceeding to Session 2 (12-week sprint)
- **Venture Leader:** Denis Streltsov
- **Lead Mentor:** Jocelyn McMinn
- **Formal Mentors:** Terence Tham, Dave Lee
- **Informal Mentors:** Doug Beach, Michael Lipsett
- **MBA Student:** Max Zhang (Haskayne MBA, Kearl oil sands experience + energy/environmental law expertise)

**Sprint 2 Objectives (Session 2 targets):**
1. **Pilot:** Secure paid pilot with major oil sands operator (CNRL/Suncor/Imperial) for Q2 2026 deployment
2. **Messaging:** Develop "Operational Intelligence Platform" playbook proving operational cost savings
3. **Capital:** Finalize 24-month roadmap for $1.5M pre-seed + secure $250K non-dilutive matching funds

**Key Session 1 Insights:**
- Tech validated as "extremely exciting" (Mike Lipsett, former Suncor Tailings Research head)
- Pitch is "an and, not an either or" (regulatory compliance AND operational efficiency)
- Alberta oil sands market is "technically massive" by CDL standards
- "Hyper-focus on Alberta" before expanding (mentor consensus)
- Patrick Elliott mandate: "Get into their kitchen" (proactive AER engagement)

**Where this should go:** Section 2.1 (Current State) - add "CDL Program Status" subsection

---

### [2025-11-14] Should Add: Max Zhang as Strategic Asset

**Missing element discovered:**
Max Zhang MBA student pairing is an exceptional strategic asset, not just "a student helper."

**Recommendation:**
Add to Section 3 (Team) or Section 4 (Strategic Assets):

**Max Zhang - MBA Student Partner (CDL Sprint 2):**
- **Background:** Kearl Oil Sands Project experience (2013-2014, Thermon) - same site as Luminous field validation
- **Expertise:** Energy & Environmental Law (7 years lecturer), regulatory/policy specialist, data analytics
- **Strategic Value:**
  - Rare combination: oil sands operational knowledge + regulatory expertise
  - Perfect fit for Patrick Elliott's AER engagement mandate
  - Can execute high-value projects (AER strategy, regulatory roadmap, market research)
- **Time Commitment:** Up to 10 hours/week
- **Deliverable:** In time for Session 2 (12-week sprint)

**Three Potential Project Areas:**
1. AER Engagement Strategy & Regulatory Roadmap (RECOMMENDED)
2. Operational Intelligence Platform Positioning Research
3. Offshore Europe Market Entry Research

**Where this should go:** Section 3 (Team Composition) - add "Strategic Partners" subsection including Max Zhang and CDL mentors

---

### [2025-11-14] Should Add: Folder Organization Philosophy

**Missing element discovered:**
No guidance on how to maintain document organization as company grows and projects complete.

**Recommendation:**
Add to Section 4 (Document Portfolio Guide):

**Folder Organization Philosophy:**
- **Active folders:** Only current work (3-5 files max per project)
- **Archive folders:** Completed phases (pre-session-1, session-1-prep, etc.)
- **Naming convention:** YYYY-MM-DD-topic.md for dated files
- **Scalability:** Structure should accommodate growth without clutter
- **Preservation:** Archive historical work (don't delete), but keep active workspace clean

**Example:** CDL-Application folder cleanup (Nov 14, 2025)
- Before: 18 files (application phase, Session 1 prep, active work)
- After: 3 active files (Program Hub, Max Zhang Prep, LRD Notes) + organized archive
- Benefit: Easy navigation, preserved history, scalable for Sprint 2 growth

**Where this should go:** Section 4 (Document Portfolio Guide) - add "Organization & Archival Strategy" subsection

---

### [2025-11-14] Should Update: Section 5 (Working Preferences) - Communication Context Awareness

**Current gap:**
Section 5 captures Jeff's tone preferences but doesn't note that tone varies by context (email vs. relationship-building vs. technical discussions).

**Add to Section 5:**

**Communication Context Awareness:**
- **Email (professional stakeholders):** Direct, concise, no excessive flattery (see Nov 14 mentor email revision)
- **Relationship-building (warm contacts):** Humble confidence, authentic, patient (see Oct 31 Ty Vaness, Mark Donner emails)
- **Technical discussions:** Data-driven, honest about limitations, specific (see Kearl validation materials)
- **Investor pitches:** Clear value prop, realistic timelines, de-risked narrative (TBD as fundraising progresses)

**Key Learning:**
- Same "humble confidence" foundation, different expression by context
- Always avoid: Excessive superlatives, gushing, over-promising
- Always include: Specific examples, honest assessment, clear asks

**Where this should go:** Section 5 (Working Preferences - Jeff's Style)

---

### [2025-11-14] Should Purge: Nothing Identified

No obsolete information identified in this session. Existing Master Context content remains relevant.

### 2. Section 5 (Working Preferences) - Add Email Communication Style

**INSERT NEW SUBSECTION AFTER "What Works with Jeff":**

---

#### Jeff's Email Communication Style

**Context:** Professional emails to stakeholders (mentors, advisors, potential partners) require direct, concise tone without excessive flattery.

**Characteristics:**
- **Direct language:** "Great feedback" (not "incredible feedback"), "helped us refocus" (not "transformative")
- **Single appreciation:** Thank once per message, not repeatedly
- **Businesslike closing:** "Thanks again for your support" (not "Looking forward to working together!")
- **No signature fluff:** Name, title, phone (no taglines, quotes, or excessive contact info)
- **Realistic numbers:** Use "~" for approximations ($1.5M not $1,500,000.00)
- **Avoid superlatives:** No "transformative," "incredible," "excited," "can't wait," "looking forward"

**What to Avoid:**
- ❌ "Over flattering" or "kiss assy" language (Jeff's exact words)
- ❌ Multiple thank-yous in same message
- ❌ Excessive enthusiasm markers
- ❌ Overly verbose explanations

**Context Awareness:**
- Email (professional) = Direct and concise
- Relationship-building (warm contacts) = Humble confidence, authentic (see Oct 31 session)
- Technical discussions = Data-driven, honest about limitations
- Same foundation ("humble confidence"), different expression by context

**Example Revision (Nov 14, 2025 Mentor Email):**
- **Draft:** "Thank you all for the incredible feedback during Session 1—the guidance has been transformative for how we're thinking about the next 12 weeks."
- **Jeff's revision:** "Thank you all for the great feedback during Session 1, the guidance helped us refocus how we're thinking about the next 12 weeks."

### 3. Section 4 (Document Portfolio Guide) - Add Folder Organization

**INSERT NEW SUBSECTION:**

---

#### Folder Organization & Archival Strategy

**Philosophy:**
- **Active folders:** Only current work (3-5 files max per project)
- **Archive folders:** Completed phases organized by date/phase
- **Naming convention:** YYYY-MM-DD-topic.md for session captures and dated files
- **Scalability:** Structure accommodates growth without clutter
- **Preservation:** Archive historical work (don't delete), keep active workspace clean

**Example: CDL-Application Folder (Nov 14, 2025 cleanup):**
```
CDL-Application/
├── Luminous - CDL Program Hub.md (active)
├── Max Zhang - Intro Call Prep.md (active)
├── CDL - LRD Notes.md (active reference)
└── archive/
    ├── pre-session-1/ (12 files: application, prep docs)
    └── session-1-prep/ (3 files: templates, prep packages)
```

**Before cleanup:** 18 files (application phase + Session 1 prep + active)
**After cleanup:** 3 active files + organized archive
**Benefit:** Easy navigation, preserved history, scalable for Sprint 2

**When to Archive:**
- Project phase complete (e.g., Session 1 prep after Session 1 passes)
- Document superseded by newer version (e.g., draft objectives → finalized objectives)
- Reference material no longer actively used (e.g., application materials post-acceptance)
