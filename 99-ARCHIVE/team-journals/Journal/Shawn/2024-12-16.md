Shawn's review

1. Good overall summary of tasks moving forward
2. Many of these items can be flushed out in greater detail
3. Spoke to lawyer Bob Benson, Calgary. 

->Hourly rate is $625, $1200 of billable time on file to date, but won't be charged for that
->Incorporation files for new clients $950 plus out of pocket costs (corporate registry fees)
-> Does not include unaminous shareholder agreement, which is optional
-> One company is more straightforward, less costly
->Two companies could also work
-> We need to find a corporate accountant, and he is ready to meet about the incorporation
-> Needs name of company to run name availability search
