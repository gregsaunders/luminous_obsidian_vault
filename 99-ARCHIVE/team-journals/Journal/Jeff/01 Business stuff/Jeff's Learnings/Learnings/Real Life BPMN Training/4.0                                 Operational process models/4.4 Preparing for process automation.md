Describing a process from an organizational perspective is only one task of modeling a process at the operational level. It’s not even the most interesting task! The holy grail actually is the smooth transfer from human to technical flows, in other words, from the functional to the executable process model.

In section 1.1.4 on page 5, we show how an executable process model can be interpreted directly by a workflow engine to combine human workflow with service orchestration. Since this is also central to the IT perspective on BPM, we focus on this approach in the following sections and in Chapter 5 (see figure 4.10 on the following page). An alternative would be to implement the process logic without a workflow engine, but in a general programming language such as Java or C#. That’s a scenario we’ll address in section 4.4.5 on page 132.

#### 4.4.1 Designing for support by a workflow engine

The desired technical implementation for a process can be discussed and documented with the models we did for the individual participants. Let’s now consider the participants as users of software, and let’s see what performance they expect from an automated process. In this thought experiment, the workflow engine itself becomes a participant with which the user exchanges messages.

Falko, as hiring department manager, describes the desired support in the post a job process:

*"I record a vacancy in a form on our portal and then send it. If the job description is ready to be checked, I want to see it in my to-do list on the portal. I process the task by reading the description, and I either request corrections or I release it. After the job advertisement runs, I want a short email notice that everything worked out."*

If you remember Falko’s process model from figure 4.5 on page 123, you will recognize his description, but there are two major differences:

- The Human Resources Department’s reaction to requests is not to be shown as a task on the portal. It is still processed by email or phone.
- The confirmation message about successful postings is new. 

Now we expand on the process model:

- We subdivide it into lanes called HR portal and Other.
- We assign all the tasks to be executed on the portal to its lane. For our purposes, a message event represents a human task that displays in the task list. A task with an outgoing message flow means that the user has completed a human task. The XOR gateway shows that the task may have different results, such as request correction or release job description.
- The first task in the HR portal lane is "report vacancy. This is not a task that was assigned to the user by the workflow engine because it does not follow the corresponding message event. It is possible, however, for the user to trigger the process, that is, to effect an instantiation. If so, the workflow engine must provide the corresponding option, usually by means of a form available on the portal, which can be filled in at any time.
- The request made by the Human Resources Department, as well as the reaction to it, are assigned to the Other lane because neither are realized on the portal, but rather through the usual channels: phone or email. The message conveying that the advertisement was published also belongs in the Other lane. Although the workflow engine sends that message, it reaches the user by email, and not as a notification in the portal.

The result is in figure 4.11, which shows the workflow engine as another participant, but still with the pool collapsed.

![[Journal/Jeff/01 Business stuff/Jeff's Learnings/Learnings/Real Life BPMN Training/4.0                                 Operational process models/attachments/Pasted image 20240523084638.png]]

Now we learn something new from Christine, the Human Resources clerk: "A vacancy report appears as a new entry in the task list of the HR portal. This is where I write the job description and then forward it to the hiring department for verification. Forwarding it completes the task. If I have to correct the description, that comes up on my task list too. If the hiring department releases the job description, however, I essentially receive notice by the appearance of an initiate advertisement task. In that case, I specify the advertising channels on the portal and then initiate the advertisement. If the advertisement runs successfully, I want a short notice that everything worked out."

Applying the principles discussed in this chapter results in figure 4.12, but with one difference: The user doesn’t trigger the process any more. Falko already took care of this. Christine only has to react to the new entry in her task list on the portal. You will recognize this by the start event of the message type.

![[Journal/Jeff/01 Business stuff/Jeff's Learnings/Learnings/Real Life BPMN Training/4.0                                 Operational process models/attachments/Pasted image 20240523084916.png]]

#### 4.4.2 Required processes of the workflow engine

We will now define the first version of the technical flow. As process analysts, we don’t need as much input from the process participants now. We can turn our attention to the process engineer. We consult with the process engineer to determine how to implement the process with the workflow engine. We show the pools of the human participants in a collaboration diagram, and we expand the pool of the workflow engine as another participant, dividing the workflow engine pool into three lanes:

- The hiring department manager gets a lane, as does the Human Resources clerk. All the tasks placed in these lanes are user tasks, which is to say, tasks for humans to complete.
- The third lane is for fully automated tasks. These are things like interface calls (service tasks) or internal program fragments (script tasks). You can also store whole subprocesses in this lane.

The process steps to be implemented in the engine result directly from the behaviour of users Falko and Christine. The process starts because Falko reports a vacancy by filling in a form on the portal. He sends it, which is represented by the start event of the message type. The workflow engine then assigns the write job description task to Christine. Once Christine completes her task, the engine assigns the check job description task to Falko. Falko can either release the description or ask for a correction. Depending on Falko’s choice, the engine will assign either trigger advertisement or correct job description to Christine. If she has to correct it, the job description returns to Falko as another check job description task. This loop repeats until Falko releases the job description.

The engine assigns trigger advertisement to Christine after Falko releases the description. First, she has to specify the channels through which the job is to be advertised, and then she has to initiate the action. This tells the engine that Christine has completed trigger advertisement. The engine then executes the publish advertisement subprocess, which consists mainly of interface calls. (It is encapsulated as a subprocess at this point in order to avoid overloading the diagram.) At the end, the workflow engine sends confirmation emails to both Falko and Christine to inform them that the advertisement was successfully published.

The collaboration diagram in figure 4.13 on the next page shows the technical process flow, which is executable in the workflow engine. There is some redundancy within the diagram because the users are represented in their own pools, but they also have lanes in the pool for the workflow engine. This is important for separating responsibilities: The participants always decide on the routing within a pool, that is, they determine which path exits an XOR gateway.

![[Journal/Jeff/01 Business stuff/Jeff's Learnings/Learnings/Real Life BPMN Training/4.0                                 Operational process models/attachments/Pasted image 20240523085617.png]]

Christine, for example, decides if she can write the job description without further input or if she has to get Falko to clear up discrepancies. The workflow engine can’t do that; it doesn’t even notice this decision. On the other hand, the workflow engine does decide if Christine needs to execute correct job description or trigger advertisement next because the corresponding XOR gateway is in its pool. The workflow engine makes this decision based on Falko’s decision following his review.

Our collaboration diagram solves a problem that arises frequently when attempting to evolve a functional (operational) process model into an executable one: mixing control instances in a single pool. As we keep saying, people and workflow engines almost always have their respective decisions to make within a process. Until you segregate control instances into appropriate pools, it will be difficult to achieve a model that you can execute in a workflow engine.

Another advantage to this approach is that we still can present views optimized for our targeted groups of users:

- The process analyst can see the entire collaboration diagram.
- The process engineer can see only the workflow engine’s pool.
- The process participants can see their own pools only. Not only are these pools less complex than the whole collaboration diagram, but they also contain additional information not part of the workflow engine’s pool: that inquiries are made in case of discrepancies, for instance.

Our judgment is that this approach is the only practical way to align business and IT in a BPMN process model.

#### 4.4.3 Further requirements

Could our process engineer implement the process from the diagram as shown? Probably, but there are issues still to be settled, such as the templates to be displayed and the exact tasks in a vacancy notification or a job description. These are typical kinds of requirements for any software project, however, and they do not affect the process logic. We don’t recommend documenting these requirements directly in BPMN; instead, we suggest linking them to the process at appropriate points. That way, the process represents a central starting point for requirements documentation. Of course, your BPMN tool must support linking.

We have categorized typical requirements as they occur in projects for the development of process applications in figure 4.14. Besides BPMN, we use graphic screen designs, class diagrams, decision tables, and text to document requirements. In integration-intensive projects, we use, among other tools, diagrams to describe system landscapes.

![[Journal/Jeff/01 Business stuff/Jeff's Learnings/Learnings/Real Life BPMN Training/4.0                                 Operational process models/attachments/Pasted image 20240523105926.png]]

You can see drafts of screens and confirmation emails for the job advertisement process and how they link to the process model in figure 4.15 on the next page. Sometimes you can derive the control elements to be provided on the screens from participants’ pools. We know, for example, that Falko can release a job description or request a correction. That may imply the need for option buttons (also known as radio buttons) on the form Falko sees. Options representing advertising channels may be needed for Christine.

##### Business logic and rules

Business logic is, for example, a calculation to be programmed. It is appropriate to package the calculations as services so that the workflow engine can call them through service tasks. This builds direct reference to the paradigm of service-oriented architecture (SOA).

Business decisions can be represented in a decision engine, and they can be called from the workflow engine through custom-developed, business-rule tasks. We deal with this subject in section 4.5.6 on page 144 and section 6.2.5 on page 174.

In either case, it usually makes sense not to model the respective requirements fully in BPMN. A better solution is simply to reference business logic or rules in the process diagram through service or business rule tasks.

##### Screen flows

Screen flows are a borderline case because, from the process automation perspective, they serve only to execute a single task. It also is difficult to do if the sequence of screens varies with the entries a user makes or with the data established between screens. Screen flows, however, are also processes. UML activity diagrams have been used often to model them, which suggests that BPMN can as well.

Clean BPM architecture strictly separates screen flows from the process model. In other words, a workflow engine is only loosely coupled to a screen flow application by means of clearly defined interfaces. To be consistent about this, you have to define a separate pool for the screen flow application and link it to the workflow engine and to the user with message flows. From the application’s perspective, each screen flow is an isolated process. If your process contains several screen flows, you must create a separate pool for each one, even though the same screen flow application controls them all.

If that seems too complicated, or if your workflow engine combines the screen flow control with the executable process model, you can set it aside and model the screen flow as a collaboration between user and workflow engine. We can’t recommend doing so, however, because it leads to process models that are less serviceable and more error-prone. It may be a good compromise to package screen flows in an embedded subprocess.

##### Data transformations

Data transformations are required primarily in integration-intensive processes. A clean BPM architecture requires that the process model be decoupled from the details of the interface calls. At this point, the Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) comes in, and you should represent it as a separate pool and handle it as you would a screen-flow application. You can likewise integrate these steps directly in the process model of the workflow engine by working with script tasks.

Script tasks represent internal steps of the workflow engine. Data transformations are an example. You could wrap the data transformation in a service and call it through a service task. The difference is that the transformation engine (an XSLT processor that transforms XML data, for instance) would be a component internal to the workflow engine if it were a script task. It would be provided by an external component - that is, from the perspective of the workflow engine - if it were a service task.

#### 4.4.5 Technical implementation without workflow engine

Perhaps you don’t use a workflow engine to execute the technical process flows. Perhaps you program it in Java, C#, or another classic programming language. This doesn’t matter for the transition from the strategic level to the operational; your compiler or interpreter equates to the workflow engine. Doing without a workflow engine may mean that you cannot execute the process logic directly from an operational process model. Another specification - called requirements specification, or detailed technical specification - will be required instead before the implementation. The process diagrams developed at the operational level can be integrated in this IT specification to form the basis of the technical design.

In conventional software development, requirements are often established without an end-to-end perspective of a process. Instead, they provide a compilation of functions that a user executes in a specified order, depending on the process to be carried out. These functions can be defined as applications or use cases in the design phase, which brings us to the classic domain of the Unified Modeling Language (UML).

You can apply BPM and our framework to such projects, but remember that each use case represents an independent process. You have to define a separate pool for each use case. Compared to implementing in a workflow engine, the user has responsibility for linking the use cases into a process that could be represented in a single pool.

Occasionally, the same use case can apply to different scenarios. We recommend modeling the respective roles as simple processes that package the use cases as subprocesses. Figure 4.16 shows two examples of that procedure. Between the pools, you see a UML use case diagram that joins the use cases. This is an example that shows UML and BPMN working well together. Figure 4.17 on the next page shows the fully modeled login use case.

We can state as a principle that BPMN can benefit conventional IT projects compared to other process notations. As we pointed out earlier, however, BPMN was not developed for that purpose but rather to support projects with a workflow engine in mind. Perhaps the more important point is that it makes little sense to do process-intensive IT projects without a workflow engine.
