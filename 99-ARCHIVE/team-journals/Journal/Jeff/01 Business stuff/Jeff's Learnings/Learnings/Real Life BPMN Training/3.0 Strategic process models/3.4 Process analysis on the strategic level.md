After making our first, rough survey of the recruiting process and documenting it, we can do two things:

1. We can start a detailed survey to model the actual state of the process at the operational level.
2. We can content ourselves with the documentation at the strategic level.

The choice depends on the purpose of the model. If we aim for ISO certification, or if we want to provide the model to process participants as a guide for their daily work, it needs to be more detailed.

Recall that our Human Resources manager is unhappy with his process, and he wants to embark on a project to improve it. He has described the symptomatic weaknesses. Remembering the BPM life cycle, we can now start with analysis to get to the bottom of the weaknesses and devise ideas for improvement (figure 3.14). A detailed survey and documentation of the current state can be helpful for this analysis, but to be honest, the cost benefit ratio is high enough to discourage it in practice. More often than not, we use the strategic process model to guide our search for causes during analysis.

How does searching for causes work? The main thing is that we listen. We listen not only to the process manager, but also to the customer of the process and, of course, to the process participants. How we proceed and what tools we use always depends on the complexity of the process, but a workshop or two involving these three parties is usually enough to identify the weak points of the process and their causes. We don’t want to discuss the interpersonal and political aspects - these quickly become a problem in such workshops. Perhaps they are a topic for a different kind of book.

Here we draw a brief picture of a workshop called Analysis of potentials in the recruiting process. The participants are:
- Process manager: Robert.
- Customer: Falko, Sales Manager and representative of the hiring departments.
- Process participants: Marina, Christine, and Stefan, clerks in the Human Resources Department.
- Process analyst: you!

After the usual introductions and explanations of purpose, you display the process model from figure 3.13 on page 111. You let it sink in. You apply your well-honed skills as a moderator to engage the participants in analyzing weak points. You list an obvious symptom, for instance, and ask the participants to confirm, correct, or amend your observation. You write the results on red index cards and attach them to a white board. They are:
- The process takes too long.
- The process is too intricate.
- The process is not transparent enough.

The complaint about the long processing time comes from Falko. Robert complains about the intricacy of the processing. Both of them agree that more transparency is needed to support comprehension of the process in whole and in its parts.

Working with the participants, you then extract the causes that account for the symptoms. Step by step, you identify and list on your red cards the causes of the causes. Some of the symptoms or causes may be attributable to a certain subprocess or task, and this will be well marked by the card affixed next to it. Other symptoms and causes will apply to the process as a whole.

All the workshop participants quickly agree that too many activities in the process are executed manually. "There must be a technical solution," is a unanimous verdict.

Robert’s criticism that the vacancy notifications from the hiring departments are often incomplete, unclear, or incorrect, is of course not received enthusiastically by Falko, but Falko cannot deny that mere notification is usually insufficient. More clarifying details have to change hands between the hiring departments and HR.

For his part, Falko faults the Excel template provided by HR for the notifications. "These things are a catastrophe! Confusing and without any assistance or explanation. You can’t even see which details are mandatory and which are optional!"

One ticklish issue involves holding times: the periods between task assignments and when they actually occur. Robert and Falko blame each other. They accuse and defend their respective staffs without useful facts to back up their statements. At this juncture, you, as diplomatic moderator, get the squabblers to agree that excess holding times harm the process, but that the causes cannot yet be clearly established nor responsibility apportioned.

The result of the workshop is the causal chain as shown in figure 3.15 on the next page. You deduce four solutions to be pursued within the scope of an improvement project:

- Reduce manual activities.
- Minimize correction loops.
- Make the current status of each operation visible at all times.
- Record and assign responsibility for idle times.

You may suppose that the solutions will be IT-enabled, though that’s not always the case in practice. We do not mean to suggest that software is the solution to every problem. BPMN development started with the need to improve processes by means of IT, however, and that is why our example reflects that kind of scenario.

In the BPM life cycle, you now enter the process design phase to devise an improved target state process. This is the time for the operational level.
