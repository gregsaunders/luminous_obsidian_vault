As already described, the process analyst models processes at the operational level. Where does he or she get the operational details needed? Usually from the process participants themselves, that is, the people working in the process. For the post a job process, we’ll interview Falko first, because he’s the manager of the hiring department. Falko describes his contribution this way:

"When I see that we need a new staff member, I report the vacancy to Human Resources. I then wait for them to send me the job description so that I can check it before they publish the advertisement. I may have to request a correction to the job description, but otherwise I release it. And sometimes HR has additional questions about tasks or qualifications, so I make myself available for clarifications."

Note: BPMN 2.0 does not allow sequence flows to flow directly into an intermediate event following an event gateway. This prohibition seems unnecessary to us, and we advocate that it be removed in future versions of the specification. For the time being, try representing this type of scenario as shown in figure 4.6.

Christine, the Human Resources clerk, has a different point of view about the post a job process: "When a job vacancy is reported to me, I write a job description based on the details I’m given," she says. "If there are ambiguities in those details, I have to ask the hiring department about them. After I finish the description, I submit it to the hiring department for it to be checked, then I wait for it to be released. Sometimes they do that right away, but sometimes they reject it and ask for corrections. In that case, I correct the description and submit it again to be checked. Once the description is finally released, I publish the advertisement for the job."

When we collapse Falko’s pool and show Christine’s, the result looks like figure 4.7.

What have we achieved so far? We have explicitly modeled the operational details of the post a job process. At the same time, we created two process models that are not overly complicated on their own.

The consumers of our models must have some basic knowledge of BPMN. They must:

- understand events —intermediate events in particular.
- understand the difference between a data-based and an event-based gateway.
- understand the difference between the sequence and the message flow.

The burden on the users of our models is greater at the operational level than it is at the strategic level. The first target audience for the operational level is the process analyst, who can use the model as the basis for a detailed analysis as well as for an IT implementation. We show this later. In all likelihood, the process analyst developed the model in BPMN, so his or her understanding of the model can be presumed.

The second target audience is the participants whose work the model represents - Falko and Christine. They should be partners with the process analyst in a dialog about improvements, and they should at least understand the models. You may find them both later using the diagrams as a guideline for their work, helping to answer the questions "How should I do my work?" and "What do I have to do next?"

So, will participants like Christine and Falko accept the models? Our experience shows that they will, provided that:

- Each participant sees only his or her own pool and not the full complexity of the process. This requires that the process model be developed accordingly and an adequate tool used to present it.
- The participants were provided with a basic briefing on BPMN, and a simple key or legend to explain the symbols. As the process analyst, you probably will have to do the instruction yourself. Tools often provide a key or legend.

Of course we can view post a job as a whole by expanding both pools, and we can show it to Christine and Falko as a detailed collaboration diagram (figure 4.8 on the next page). But isn’t it obvious how much more complicated this diagram is, compared to separate views of the pools? Would the process participants be more likely or less likely to accept and use the more complex diagram? In any event, the entire collaboration only matters to the process analyst. In the following two sections, we will deal with collaboration diagrams as we consider process automation.

BPMN provides the option to hide the complexities of the collaboration in a choreography diagram (figure 4.9 on the facing page). The advantage is that this represents the interaction between participants more compactly. It is therefore good for orienting the process analyst. On the other hand, a choreography diagram omits internal steps that do not help communication between participants. You can’t see, for example, that the Human Resources clerk executes the advertise job task. We regard choreography diagrams as sometimes useful additions to operational level collaboration diagrams, but usually they can’t take the place of collaborations.
