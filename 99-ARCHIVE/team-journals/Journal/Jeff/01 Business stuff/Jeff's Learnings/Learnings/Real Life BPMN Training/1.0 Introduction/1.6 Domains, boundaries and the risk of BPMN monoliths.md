## Domains, boundaries and the risk of BPMN monoliths

The microservice architectural style is currently on the rise. For example, in a 2018 survey ([Cam18]) 63% of participating companies had already adopted microservices architectures. The idea is that software is no longer built as large monolithic applications, but rather as a bunch of smaller microservices that focus on exactly one business capability each. Every services is owned by one team that cares about design, development, deployment, operations and maintenance. A microservice has a clear responsibility and API, and only these are known to the rest of the company without implementation details. This is contrary to horizontal teams you see so often, like the business analysts, the software developers, the database admins and operation folks. Instead, you will have the "customer onboarding" team, that bundles all these roles and can act on its own.

Splitting up logic into microservices influences business processes and their models in BPMN. There are only rare cases where a business process will be handled completely by one microservice, instead you will see microservices that need to collaborate to implement end-to-end business processes.

If you now think of the Camunda house, this means that several operational processes (in the respective microservices) interact to achieve the overall goal. If we wanted to drive the metaphor further, it would probably be a village consisting of different Camunda houses. The end-to-end process from the customers’ point of view would probably be the gate in the city wall and... But let’s drop that and look at a small example in figure 1.10.

The microservice inbound application is responsible for end-to-end processing applications for an insurance policy. Therefore it includes a BPMN process, which we’ve already looked at. Now, however, the policy itself is an independent task and will probably be dealt with in a separate microservice. This is perhaps only a facade in front of an existing legacy system. The two microservices must now work together to process a new application.

The challenge is usually to determine the boundaries of the services and the exact responsibility of individual services. There is no right or wrong, only more or less suitable. In our example, there are different variants that can all make sense. For example, the policy microservice could send out documents itself to the customer, but that could also be part of the application microservice. However, there may also be a separate service for sending documents. It is important to make a conscious decision and then design the processes accordingly. For this topic we can recommend the literature around domain-driven design. And if you are in need of a distraction anyway, please take a look on the Internet and search for the "bounded context".

At this point we just want to explicitly warn against, as we call it, "BPMN monoliths". A BPMN monolith is a process model that mixes details from different microservices, thus not respecting their responsibilities and boundaries. Such a model does not have a single person responsible for the process and is usually very cumbersome to coordinate because too many stakeholders want to participate. You cannot automate this model directly because it has to be distributed among different microservices.

Figure 1.11 shows an example of such a BPMN monolith. In addition to the processing of the application, there is business logic of the policy included, like the fact that policies only become valid if the first invoice is paid within a defined period. The application microservice should not know this detail - it only wants to know whether a policy was successful or not - and perhaps how long it has to wait at most.

We know from our own experience that in the heat of a successful modeling workshop these monoliths can be created very quickly, as many details bubble out of the participants very naturally at this moment. Often it is even helpful to understand the overall situation and to allow these models. However, they may not be continued, let alone automated, so they are clearly an intermediate step before the process is sliced into individual parts. When doing so, the microservices boundaries must be taken into account.

And, of course, it can still make sense to design a monolithic system. In this case you can model and execute a BPMN monolith accordingly.

In chapter 4.5.3 on page 140 we will follow-up on this topic again with another example.
