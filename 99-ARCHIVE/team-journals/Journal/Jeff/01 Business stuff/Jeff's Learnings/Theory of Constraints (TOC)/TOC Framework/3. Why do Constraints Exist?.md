Every system is characterized by dependent activities of some form. For example:

- A sales team depends on leads generated by their marketing team, so that they have prospects to reach out to
- Procurement depends on the finance department to pay suppliers on time, so that vendors will continue to supply materials
- An automotive dealership depends on the manufacturer to supply the right vehicles for sale to customers
- A large project requires customer specifications to be finalized by the customer before proceeding to the next phase
- A loan processing department requires certain details about each applicant in order to check their credit history

These dependent activities are inextricably linked together to form a chain.  
  
​For example, the logical flow of a very simple system might look something like this:

![Dependent Events Form a Chain](https://www.tocinstitute.org/uploads/1/1/0/9/110976539/dependent-events2_orig.png)

In other words, without receiving inputs from Stage A, Stage B cannot perform its function at all. And without inputs from Stage D, Stage E will idle. These inputs might comprise of physical work-in-process inventory or intangibles such as services, information, etc.   
  
Each stage is has a certain capacity, whether related to machine capacity, computer processing speed or the number of worker hours dedicated to the process. For example, the capacity of each stage below is estimated in Tons per Hour:

![Capacity Varies by Resource](https://www.tocinstitute.org/uploads/1/1/0/9/110976539/varying-resource-capacities_orig.png)

Note that the above capacities are never completely stable. If a machine breaks down, or an employee is absent, etc. the capacity of that stage might reduce dramatically. Similarly, if employees are trained to improve their skill, setup time is suddenly reduced, or quality yield improved, capacity might increase significantly. Capacity, therefore, is subject to enormous variation and is almost never as stable as it may appear.  
  
This variation in capacity can lead to periodic starvation of resources to the extent that they are not able to produce flow, even if there is a large backlog of customer orders:

![Disruption Causes Downstream Starvation](https://www.tocinstitute.org/uploads/1/1/0/9/110976539/disruption-causes-downstream-starvation2_orig.png)

Note how the above disruption in Stage B capacity will necessarily lead to starvation of all downstream processes. This **reduction in output comes at high cost in terms of lost sales and associated Throughput.** Even if customers can somehow be convinced to wait and no sales are lost directly, long term demand is likely to be impacted by a poor reputation for reliability in the market.

## Can Inventory Overcome This Problem?

Accumulated inventory can be used to minimize the immediate damage caused by this variation. For example, if there is inventory stock after Stage B, then downstream processes can temporarily sustain operations and create flow even while Stage B is disrupted:

![Inventory Helps Absorb Temporary Disruptions](https://www.tocinstitute.org/uploads/1/1/0/9/110976539/inventory-helps-absorb-temporary-variation_orig.png)

But if Stage B capacity remains affected for any length of time, the inventory will deplete and prove inadequate balance the flow.

## ​Should Capacity be Balanced?

To deal with the ongoing fluctuation in resource availability, as well as demand volatility, every operational system must have considerable extra capacity of most internal resources to remain stable. Such excess capacity, known as "sprint capacity," provides the flexibility needed to deal with a wide variety of potential disruptions in supply and demand.
