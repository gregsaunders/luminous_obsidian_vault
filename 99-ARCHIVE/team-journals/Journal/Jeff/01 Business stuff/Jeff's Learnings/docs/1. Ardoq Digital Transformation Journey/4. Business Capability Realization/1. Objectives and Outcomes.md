Business Capability Realization (BCR) is one of the most important guides connecting your business with the people, process owners, and IT solutions that make your organizationâ€™s capability happen. In the Business Capability Modeling (BCM) guide, we established a model to represent what the business does, now we need to understand how IT enables those capabilities.

Business Capability Realization focuses on connecting your business capability model to the elements of your organization that enable it.

Business capabilities are typically comprised of 4 domains: people/roles/departments, processes, applications and data.

In the Business Capability Realization guide, we will focus on the application domain. However, we strongly recommend reiterating through the guide if you have data in the other domains.
