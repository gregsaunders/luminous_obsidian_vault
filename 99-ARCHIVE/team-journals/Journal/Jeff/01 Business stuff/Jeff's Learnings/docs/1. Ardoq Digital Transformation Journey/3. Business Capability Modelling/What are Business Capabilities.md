# What are Business Capabilities and why are they important?

The theoretical definition of Business Capabilities is actually quite a simple one as the term refers to the core functions that a business undertakes. For example, a real estate company buys and sells properties, manages rentals, often has a finance division arranging mortgages, and so on.

What Business Capabilities do not define is how these functions are performed. In our example, Business Capabilities does not cover the application used for marketing properties on the internet or the institutions that can supply finance for a purchase.

The processes, systems, departments, and information an organization uses to realize its business capabilities will change over time but the underlying business model, the Business Capabilities, change far more slowly.

Defining, clarifying, and documenting the Business Capabilities of an organization gives it an understanding of its actual business, and, importantly, the business structure needed to support modernization, expansion and digital transformation. Once defined, the Business Capabilities become the enabler for other use cases that, once adopted, will make a business more competitive.

Business Capabilities are the building blocks and language of the organizationâ€™s business value streams and business processes, with each capability having a clear outcome. They are the enabler for the business to develop through application rationalization, budgeting, mergers and acquisitions, and so forth.
