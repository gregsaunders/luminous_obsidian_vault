## Technology Capabilities Domain
The technology capabilities domain describes business model-agnostic requirements for automated processing without defining how they are delivered.
    - Technology capabilities are split out from business capabilities to distinguish common requirements for building and running IT and communication systems from business model or process-specific requirements fulfilled by manual business processes and applications.
## Technology Capability Component
A technology capability component is a logical set of functions to be performed by a technology, technology service, database or application.
    - Technology capabilities broadly align to the technology categories defined by the market (e.g. by Gartner / Forrester).
    - Technology capabilities represent lower-level function than business capabilities. They can be composed or configured to provide multiple business capabilities or even other technology capabilities but are not natively aligned to any particular one
