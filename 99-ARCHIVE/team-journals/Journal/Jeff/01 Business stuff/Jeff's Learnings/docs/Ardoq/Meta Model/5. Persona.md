## Persona Domain
The personas domain is used to model the abstracted properties of the organization’s target customers, consumers or community members.
    - Digital businesses and organizations have increasingly shifted to become consumer-centric, and key to this shift is understanding the needs, preferences and concerns of the people they exist or aspire to serve.
## Persona Component
A persona component represents an abstracted description (i.e. not a real person) representative of a segment of the organization’s current or target customer base.
    - Personas are in some ways similar to roles, in that they describe behaviours abstracted from actual people.
    - But unlike roles, personas seek to personify their descriptions by also describing state of mind, emotional needs and responses, lifestyle preferences and other contextual information.
    - Doing this ensures that the organization adapts to the individual’s requirements, unlike a role which specifies what the organization requires from an individual.
