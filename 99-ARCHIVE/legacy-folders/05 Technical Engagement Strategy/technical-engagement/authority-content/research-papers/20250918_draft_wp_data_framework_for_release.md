# Technical Brief: A Field-Validated Platform for High-Frequency Monitoring of Naphthenic Acids in Oil Sands Process Water

---

## **1. Abstract**

This brief presents performance data for a new, peer-reviewed biosensor platform (*ACS Synthetic Biology*, 2024) designed to address the operational need for high-frequency monitoring of naphthenic acids (NAs) in oil sands process water (OSPW). In controlled mesocosm studies, the platform demonstrated a strong correlation (R values between -0.97 and -0.99, p < 0.00) with Orbitrap MS for tracking NA degradation. In a subsequent large-scale field pilot, the platform showed strong qualitative agreement with HRMS trends. The system provides quantitative results from raw OSPW samples within 24 hours, with detection limits ranging from 2-30 mg/L depending on the specific biosensor used.

## **2. The Operational Need for High-Frequency Data**

The evolving regulatory landscape, including the Alberta government's stated intention to create standards for releasing treated tailings, requires proof that water treatment technologies are effective. This necessitates a frequency of water quality data that traditional lab-based methods, with their multi-week turnaround times, were not designed to provide. This data gap creates operational "blind spots" and makes proactive management of treatment systems difficult.

## **3. Platform Performance & Validation Data**

The following performance data was summarized in a technical presentation by Dr. Shawn Lewenza (Athabasca University/University of Calgary).

**3.1. Biosensor Panel & Detection Limits**

The platform utilizes a panel of three distinct biosensors, each with a defined sensitivity for different classes of NAs:

*   **p3680-lux (Classic NAs):** 2-4 mg/L
*   **marR-lux (Complex NAs):** 7-15 mg/L
*   **atuA-lux (Acyclic NAs):** 15-30 mg/L

**3.2. Performance in Oil Sands Process Water (OSPW)**

The biosensor panel has been validated directly in the complex OSPW matrix with minimal sample preparation:

*   **Raw OSPW Samples:** Successfully detected NAs in 22 out of 24 unique raw OSPW samples.
*   **Interference:** Preliminary studies have shown consistent sensor performance in the target water matrix, which is typically less contaminated than raw tailings as it is being prepared for release or in-pit lake burial.

**3.3. Correlation with Mass Spectrometry**

The platform's performance has been rigorously compared against "gold standard" Orbitrap Mass Spectrometry.

*   **Controlled Mesocosm Studies:** In greenhouse mesocosm studies tracking NA degradation, the biosensor data showed an extremely strong and statistically significant correlation with Orbitrap MS results, with correlation coefficients (R) ranging from **-0.97 to -0.99 (p < 0.00)**.

*   **Large-Scale Field Pilot:** In a subsequent multi-season study at a large-scale constructed wetland, the platform demonstrated strong **qualitative agreement and visual concordance** with mass spectrometry. The biosensors successfully tracked the reduction of total NAs from ~70 mg/L to below the platform's signal loss threshold of ~32-36 mg/L, mirroring the trend data obtained from MS analysis.

## **4. Platform Details & Appropriate Use Cases**

**4.1. The Confluent Data Platform**

To manage the high volume of data generated by frequent monitoring, the Luminous platform moves beyond spreadsheets. The Confluent data platform is built on a modern architecture designed for integration and auditability.

*   **Integration:** The platform offers flexible data export options, including CSV and a REST API for integration with existing Laboratory Information Management Systems (LIMS) or other data analysis platforms.
*   **Auditability:** All data is timestamped within an immutable logging system to ensure a fully auditable data trail for operational and regulatory review.

**4.2. Appropriate Use Cases & Limitations**

The Luminous platform is designed as a high-frequency screening and optimization tool. The current biosensor panel was selected to provide broad specificity against the most prevalent toxic NAFC classes, with development of a general NAFC toxicity biosensor and other sensors ongoing.

The primary use cases are:
*   **Operational Monitoring:** Tracking day-to-day treatment system performance.
*   **Process Optimization:** Rapidly determining the efficacy of operational adjustments.
*   **Informing HRMS Testing:** Providing a cost-effective way to screen large numbers of samples to identify which ones require further analysis.

It is important to note that for the foreseeable future, **High-Resolution Mass Spectrometry (HRMS) remains the required standard for final compliance reporting to the AER and for any legal chain-of-custody forensics.** Our platform is a complementary tool designed to make the entire reclamation process more efficient and data-driven.

## **5. A Collaborative Path Forward**

The transition from containment to regulated release is a complex challenge that no single technology can solve alone. Success will require a collaborative effort between operators, regulators, community stakeholders, and technology providers.

Established analytical methods like HRMS will always be essential. The new capability offered by high-frequency biosensing is not a replacement, but a complementary tool designed to fill a specific, critical data gap. It is an important part of an integrated monitoring toolkit.

We believe the path forward is one of partnership and shared learning. We invite technical and strategic leaders for a confidential technical briefing. In this session, we can share our full validation data and discuss how this new monitoring capability can be integrated into your specific tailings management and reclamation strategies.
