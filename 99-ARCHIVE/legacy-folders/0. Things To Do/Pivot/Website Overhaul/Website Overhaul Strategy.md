# Website Overhaul Strategy Plan
*Aligned with ERA TTC Pivot to Monitoring Infrastructure*

## Executive Summary
Complete website transformation from "biological treatment platform" messaging to "essential monitoring infrastructure" positioning, with emphasis on solving the data chaos problem and enabling all treatment technologies.

## Current State Analysis

### Problems with Existing Website:
1. **Equal emphasis** on bioaugmentation and monitoring
2. **No mention** of OSMWSC Recommendation 5
3. **Missing** field-deployable roadmap
4. **Undervalued** data platform capabilities
5. **Competing** positioning vs enabling positioning
6. **No articulation** of spreadsheet chaos problem

## Priority Pages for Revision

### 1. Homepage (CRITICAL - Week 1)
