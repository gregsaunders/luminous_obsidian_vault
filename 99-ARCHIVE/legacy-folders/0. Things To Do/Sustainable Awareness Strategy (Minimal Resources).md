## Sustainable Awareness Strategy (Minimal Resources)

### 1. Academic/Research Route
- **Publish everything.** Turn your Kearl data into multiple papers
- **Present at conferences** - Oil Sands Research Symposium, tailings conferences
- **Partner with universities** for graduate student projects using your technology
- **Cost:** Mostly your time, some travel

### 2. Regulatory Awareness (Highest Impact)
- **Submit comments** on Alberta's tailings regulations mentioning monitoring gaps
- **Request meetings** with Alberta Environment about monitoring challenges
- **Connect with Oil Sands Mine Water Steering Committee members**
- **Offer free demonstrations** to regulators
- **Cost:** Your time only

### 3. Community/Indigenous Engagement
- **Offer free water testing** to downstream communities
- **Present at Indigenous community meetings** about monitoring capabilities
- **Partner with environmental groups** concerned about tailings
- **Document everything** - create transparency others can't provide
- **Cost:** Minimal - travel and some supplies

### 4. Industry Awareness (Long-term)
- **Monthly blog posts** on LinkedIn about NA monitoring challenges
- **Free webinars** quarterly on tailings monitoring
- **Case study documentation** from any testing you do
- **Industry newsletter** contributions

## Revenue Bridge Strategy
While maintaining awareness, you need income. Consider:
- **Consulting** on environmental monitoring (leverage your expertise)
- **Part-time technical role** with environmental consulting firms
- **Grant writing services** for cleantech companies
- **Teaching/training** on environmental monitoring

## The Long Game
Keep the technology warm with minimal investment:
- Maintain relationships with your three potential customers
- Continue small-scale testing when opportunities arise
- Document everything for future regulatory discussions
- Build credibility through publications and presentations

## Honest Reality Check
This technology may take 5-10 years to find its market. The regulatory environment needs to mature, companies need to feel more pressure, and awareness needs to build. That's not failure - that's the timeline for systemic environmental solutions.

Your choice: maintain this as a passion project while building other income, or let it go entirely. Both are valid choices. But don't abandon something potentially important just because the market timing isn't perfect right now.

The environmental problem isn't going away, and neither is the need for better monitoring solutions.
