## Section 4: Preparing for Indigenous and Local Stakeholder Engagement

Engaging with Indigenous communities and local stakeholders is a critical aspect of responsible resource-related development in Alberta. For Luminous BioSolutions, building positive relationships based on respect and transparency is essential for gaining social license, understanding local perspectives, and potentially identifying partnership opportunities as the company prepares for pilot projects and future deployment in the oil sands region.

### 4.1 Best Practices for Respectful Engagement in Alberta

Effective engagement goes beyond mere information dissemination; it requires a commitment to building genuine, lasting relationships.126 Key principles derived from best practices include:

- Foundation of Respect and Trust: Acknowledge the unique relationship Indigenous Peoples have with the land, their inherent and Treaty rights (Treaties 6, 7, and 8 cover Alberta), and distinct cultures and governance structures.126 Approach engagement with humility, honesty, and a focus on mutual benefit.134 Recognize the importance of the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) and the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) Calls to Action, particularly #92 regarding business responsibilities.126
    
- Early and Ongoing Communication: Initiate engagement early in the project lifecycle, ideally during conceptualization or planning, well before decisions are finalized.127 Maintain communication throughout the project's duration.128 Understand that building trust takes time – relationships move at the "speed of trust".127 Be patient and respect that communities have their own priorities and capacity limitations.127
    
- Cultural Awareness and Protocol: Invest time in learning about the specific histories, traditions, languages, and protocols of the First Nations and Métis communities being engaged.126 Understand the roles of Elders and Knowledge Keepers and follow appropriate protocols when seeking their guidance (e.g., offering tobacco, providing honoraria/compensation).126 Be sensitive to different communication styles and cultural norms.126 Using local Indigenous liaisons or cultural advisors can be beneficial.126
    
- Transparency and Information Sharing: Provide clear, accessible, and timely information about Luminous, its technology, proposed activities (like pilots), and potential impacts (both positive and negative).127 Avoid technical jargon and use plain language. Be open about uncertainties and project plans.
    
- Active Listening and Responsiveness: Engagement must be a two-way process focused on listening to understand concerns, perspectives, values, and traditional knowledge.131 Seek feedback, document it accurately, and demonstrate how it has been considered or incorporated into planning where feasible.135 Follow up on questions and commitments made.
    
- Identifying Mutual Benefits: Explore opportunities for collaboration, community investment, training, employment, or Indigenous business participation related to Luminous's activities.128
    

### 4.2 Identifying Key Communities and Stakeholders

Luminous must identify the specific Indigenous communities and local stakeholder groups relevant to potential pilot project locations, primarily within the Athabasca oil sands region / Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo (RMWB).

- Indigenous Communities: Research is needed to confirm which First Nations and Métis communities have asserted traditional territories, reserve lands, or rights that could potentially be affected by activities at specific oil sands mine sites or downstream along the Athabasca River system. Based on available information, key groups likely include:
    

- First Nations: Fort McKay First Nation (FMFN), Mikisew Cree First Nation (MCFN), Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation (ACFN), and Chipewyan Prairie First Nation (CPFN) are frequently mentioned in the context of oil sands development and agreements.111 Other Dene, Cree, and potentially Métis communities within Treaty 8 territory may also have interests depending on the specific location and potential impacts (e.g., downstream effects).133
    
- Métis Organizations: Identify relevant Métis Nation of Alberta Locals or recognized Métis Settlements within the RMWB or potentially affected downstream areas.131
    

- Local Stakeholders (RMWB/Fort McMurray Area): Other groups with interests in the region include:
    

- Municipal Government: The Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo (RMWB) plays a key role in regional planning and infrastructure.143
    
- Industry Groups: Organizations like the Oil Sands Developers Group (OSDG) 148 and the Oil Sands Community Alliance (OSCA) 111 represent operator interests but also engage on regional socio-economic and environmental issues. Collaboration or information sharing might be relevant.
    
- Environmental Non-Governmental Organizations (ENGOs): While potentially not direct local stakeholders for engagement, ENGOs active in the oil sands region (e.g., Pembina Institute, Environmental Defence, CPAWS) monitor environmental performance and advocate on issues like tailings management.2 Understanding their perspectives is part of the broader landscape. Local environmental committees may also exist.
    
- Community Groups & Residents: General public, other local businesses, and potentially landowners downstream.146
    

- Research and Mapping: Luminous must undertake site-specific research based on potential operator pilot locations. This involves confirming treaty areas, traditional land use areas, reserve/settlement locations, and downstream communities. Resources include provincial consultation databases (e.g., Alberta's Aboriginal Consultation Office system), community websites, Treaty organization resources, and potentially engaging local expertise.127

### 4.3 Preparatory Approach and Materials

Successful engagement requires careful preparation, both internally and in the materials presented.

- Internal Preparation:
    

- Cultural Competency Training: Ensure the Luminous team involved in engagement receives training on Indigenous history in Canada (Treaties, residential schools, UNDRIP, TRC), local Indigenous cultures, and respectful engagement protocols.126
    
- Engagement Plan: Develop a formal plan outlining goals, target communities/stakeholders, key messages, methods (meetings, presentations, site visits if appropriate), timelines, responsibilities, and a system for tracking interactions, concerns raised, and commitments made.127
    
- Resource Allocation: Dedicate sufficient time and resources (personnel, budget for travel/honoraria) for meaningful engagement.127
    

- Information Materials: Develop materials that are clear, concise, visually engaging, and free of technical jargon. Translate key summaries into local Indigenous languages where appropriate and feasible.154 Materials should cover:
    

- Introduction to Luminous: Who the company is, its mission, and its commitment to responsible development and transparency.
    
- Technology Explanation: Simple description of how the biosensors work (detecting NAs quickly) and how the bioremediation works (using natural bacteria to clean water), focusing on the purpose (addressing tailings contamination).
    
- Proposed Activities: Explain the concept of pilot projects – small-scale, controlled tests to see how the technology works on site. Be clear about the limited scope and duration.
    
- Potential Impacts and Benefits: Honestly discuss potential environmental aspects (e.g., introduction of bacteria, though aiming for positive outcomes). Clearly outline potential benefits: improved environmental monitoring, faster cleanup of toxic NAs, contribution to reclamation goals, enhanced transparency through data sharing, and potential future economic/employment opportunities.
    

- Engagement Strategy Execution:
    

- Initial Contact & Relationship Building: Identify the correct contact person within each community/organization (e.g., Consultation Coordinator, Lands Department, Economic Development Officer, Chief and Council administrative support).127 Follow their preferred communication protocol. Initial meetings should prioritize introductions, listening to community priorities and concerns, sharing basic information about Luminous and its intentions, and building rapport.126 Avoid making immediate requests for support.
    
- Information Sharing & Dialogue: Schedule follow-up meetings or workshops to present more detailed information using the prepared materials. Facilitate open discussion, actively listen to feedback, questions, and concerns.131
    
- Transparency and Data Sharing: Leverage the inherent transparency of the Luminous data platform. Offer to share pilot data (or summaries thereof, respecting operator agreements) with communities as a sign of good faith and to build trust.
    
- Responsiveness and Follow-up: Document all interactions, concerns, and commitments. Respond promptly to inquiries and follow through on any actions agreed upon.128 Demonstrate how feedback is being considered.
    
- Long-Term Perspective: Treat engagement as an ongoing process of relationship maintenance, not a one-off requirement for project approval.127
    

### 4.4 Strategic Considerations for Stakeholder Engagement

Luminous's technology offers a unique advantage in stakeholder engagement. The data platform's ability to provide real-time, accessible information on NA levels directly addresses historical concerns about transparency and environmental monitoring in the oil sands.20 Proactively offering this transparency – potentially providing community dashboards or regular data summaries from pilots (subject to operator agreements) – can be a powerful tool for building trust and demonstrating a commitment to open communication, differentiating Luminous from past industry practices.127

Given the history of resource development impacts and the legal standing of Indigenous rights 131, initiating engagement before pilot sites are finalized or regulatory applications are submitted is not just best practice, it is strategically imperative. Early dialogue allows Luminous to build relationships from a foundation of respect, understand community-specific concerns, and potentially incorporate feedback into pilot design or location considerations.127 This proactive approach can prevent misunderstandings, mitigate potential opposition, and smooth the path for future activities.

Finally, while the primary focus is environmental technology, Luminous should recognize the increasing emphasis on economic reconciliation and participation by Indigenous communities.128 Aligning with TRC Call to Action #92 128, Luminous should explore and be prepared to discuss potential future opportunities for Indigenous businesses (e.g., in deployment support, field monitoring) or employment and training, even at this early stage. Demonstrating a commitment to exploring shared economic benefits strengthens relationships and aligns with broader societal goals.140
