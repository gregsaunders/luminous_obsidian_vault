Ardoq has made getting started with Business Capabilities easy. Firstly, by building a pre-configured business capabilities use case in Ardoq which contains all the models, sample data, surveys, dashboards and presentations you need to start telling business capability stories from the moment you log in.

But even with all that great content to hand, we know you still need to go on a journey within your own team or organization.

This guide will step you through that process.

And because Ardoq was founded by experienced architects and consultants who have been through this journey many times we’ve chosen to focus on two aspects that how-to manuals often lack:

Who do I need to bring onboard, and how do I demonstrate value fast?

Ultimately, the success of your business capability modeling initiative will ride on your ability to land it in your organization. This guide will give you the best possible chance of success.

But first we have to build the map.

#### What Are My Business Capabilities?

**What** - Define and validate your business capability model
**Who** - Enterprise Architects, Business Strategists, IT Strategists, Business and IT Subject Matter Experts
**How** - Workshops, Interviews, Reference Models

Maps serve many purposes, the main ones being orientation and creating a shared understanding of the landscape.

Likewise, your business capability model exists to orient people in your organizational landscape and create a common language for cross-departmental discussions.

If that sounds simple, don’t underestimate its importance.

With a business capability map, architects and planners can tell different stories about the whole organization in a single view.

Cost, risk, Market differentiation, investment, innovation - all of these stories and more can  
be told using your business capability map as your canvas.

For the rest of this step we’ll focus on how to land that model as an agreed view of your organization.

#### Creating a Common Language

Building a common organizational language is an ambitious thing to do.

IT departments in particular love to talk about expressing themselves in business language. But the awkward reality is that in most organizations there is no common language. Marketing call a thing by one name, Finance by another and Sales by a third.

Once embedded in culture and process, these regional dialects can be very difficult to break down. So you need to be realistic about what you can achieve here.

Any architect or strategist trying to establish their business capability model as the sole official language of the business is probably going to be disappointed.

But stakeholders will recognize the value of a bridging language – a common second language to facilitate conversations across departments. So we recommend that you pitch your business capability model to your many stakeholders in exactly this way: A common language, but not the only language.

#### Avoiding the Modeling Tug-of-war

Once you start to build out your business capability map, you may find yourself being pulled in two opposing directions. This is a legacy of the historic disjoint between business and IT planning.

Business strategists may wish to focus on business processes, value streams and customer journeys; IT strategists on the other hand will certainly want to talk about technologies.

Each may make a case for having their own separate models that address their separate concerns, but when you start fragmenting your view of the business architecture, misalignment between departments is practically guaranteed.

Value chain or process models may start with high-level processes but will inevitably touch on underlying business capabilities. For example, with no single model, a business strategy’s definition of customer payments can easily differ IT's technical model (Which will contain the technical components like analytics and API management).

The key is to recognize that these aren’t separate models at all but a series of linked models with business capabilities at their heart. It takes time and determination to align business and IT planners on a common model, but it's an investment that will repay the effort by taking business-IT collaboration to a new level.

#### Validating Your Capabilities
Once you’ve established the basic shape of your model you’ll inevitably want to validate it with business and IT subject matter experts. Doing this serves a double purpose: It ensures the content of the model is accurate and complete. But it also brings people onboard, building the authority of the model and giving you a mandate to use it to drive decisions.

While most business and IT people are experts in their own domains and will contribute valuable insight into each of the areas you’ve defined, it’s best to avoid unsupervised updates to your model. The result will be a patchwork mess.

As the model’s owner, your role is to translate their expertise into a sound business capability model structure.
