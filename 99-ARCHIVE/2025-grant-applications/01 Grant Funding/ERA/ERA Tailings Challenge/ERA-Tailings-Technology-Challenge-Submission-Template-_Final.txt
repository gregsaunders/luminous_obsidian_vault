	•	Reduced land disturbance and improved reclamation potential
	•	Lower risk of wildlife exposure and containment failure
	•	Reduced air emissions from tailings ponds (e.g., methane, VOCs)
	•	Decreased reliance on freshwater withdrawals, including improved water reuse or recycling
	•	Enabling a pathway to water release
	•	Reduced waste generation or improved waste valorization
