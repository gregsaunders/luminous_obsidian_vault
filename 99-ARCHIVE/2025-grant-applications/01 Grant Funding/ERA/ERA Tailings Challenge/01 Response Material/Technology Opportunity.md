### 1. Technology Opportunity

**The Challenge:** Alberta's oil sands industry faces a critical and time-sensitive challenge: managing over 1.4 trillion litres of oil sands process-affected water (OSPW) held in tailings ponds. The primary toxicant, Naphthenic Acids (NAs), prevents safe water release, stalls land reclamation, and represents a multi-billion-dollar environmental liability. As highlighted by the Government of Alberta's Oil Sands Mine Water Steering Committee, developing effective and trusted solutions for this challenge is an urgent provincial priority.

**The Solution: An Integrated, Evidence-Based Biological Platform**

Luminous BioSolutions is commercializing an Alberta-developed, integrated biotechnology platform that directly addresses the documented performance gaps in current tailings remediation strategies. Our solution is not a single product, but a complete, data-driven management system built on three core, interconnected pillars:

**1. Rapid, Validated NA Detection (The Biosensor):** The foundation of our platform is our panel of whole-cell bacterial biosensors. This technology, developed through a decade of research at the University of Calgary and Athabasca University, has been scientifically validated and **published in the world-leading peer-reviewed journal,** _**ACS Synthetic Biology**_.

- **How it Works:** These engineered native bacteria produce a bioluminescent signal in minutes upon contact with NAs, with light intensity proportional to the concentration. In recent field testing at the Kearl Constructed Wetland pilot, our biosensor results were shown to be comparable to gold-standard mass spectrometry.
    
- **The Advantage:** This provides data in **minutes, not weeks**, at a fraction of the cost. This enables high-frequency, high-resolution monitoring that is currently impossible, directly answering the Steering Committee's call for an **"accurate, consistent and affordable"** method for measuring NAs.
    

**2. Targeted, Enhanced Remediation (Bioaugmentation):** Recent independent research on the **Kearl constructed wetland** proved that nature-based systems are a promising start, achieving a **36% reduction** in total NAFCs over a season. However, this also highlights a significant performance gap. Our bioaugmentation service is designed to solve this exact problem.

- **How it Works:** Using our biosensors, we screen thousands of native bacteria from OSPW to identify the most potent NA-degrading microbial communities. We then cultivate these "specialist" teams and deploy them to enhance natural systems.
    
- **The Advantage:** This targeted approach acts as a powerful "polishing step," designed to significantly increase degradation rates and push beyond the baseline performance of passive systems. It is a low-energy, low-GHG process that creates no secondary waste streams.
    

**3. Data-Driven Intelligence (The Confluent Platform):** Our entire process is managed and validated by our Confluent data platform.

- **How it Works:** The platform ingests the high-frequency data from our biosensors alongside other critical data streams—such as water temperature, geolocation, and weather data—to build a comprehensive model of the ecosystem. This intelligence guides the bioaugmentation strategy and tracks its success.
    
- **The Advantage:** This provides operators with unprecedented operational control, allows for continuous improvement of the remediation program, and creates the verifiable, transparent data required to satisfy regulators and build trust with Indigenous and local communities.
    

This ERA-funded project will de-risk and scale this integrated platform through a systematic, staged approach—from controlled greenhouse mesocosms, to larger outdoor systems at Innotech Alberta, and finally to on-site operator pilots. This strategy ensures we systematically validate performance and pivot as needed, providing Alberta's energy industry with a homegrown, scientifically-proven, and cost-effective solution to one of its most significant environmental challenges.
