Recommended options for safe management of oil sands mine water and reclamation of tailings ponds.

## Overview

In Alberta, and around the world, mining operations produce tailings. Alberta’s oil sands tailings ponds now contain over 1.4 billion cubic metres of liquid that is a mixture of water, sand, clay and residual bitumen and are a by-product of the extraction process. Oil sands operators are responsible for site management and reclamation, while ongoing research and technology innovation continues to inform and refine best practices.

In May 2024, Alberta established an Oil Sands Mine Water Steering Committee to assess options and provide recommendations to inform an accelerated plan for addressing oil sands mine water and tailings ponds, while protecting the health of downstream communities and the environment. For more than a year, the committee has met with industry operators, Indigenous community members, technology developers, governments, as well as academics and scientists, to review evidence and carefully consider recommendations for a path forward.

#### Timeline

- May 2024 – Oil Sands Mine Water Steering Committee formed
- May 2024 to May 2025 – Engagement
- June 12, 2025 – First 5 recommendations released
## Committee recommendations

The committee released its initial recommendations on June 12, 2025. These recommendations reflect a year of rigorous and thoughtful analysis and engagement by the steering committee. Solutions were brought forward to the steering committee by technology developers, industry partners, Indigenous communities, and others.

The committee assessed and evaluated options against feasibility criteria, including policy and regulatory alignment, environmental impacts, Indigenous perspective, public perception, and economic feasibility and technology viability. Recommendations can be read in detail:

- Recommendation 1 calls for more segregation and prioritization of use of water that has not been impacted by the industrial process, along with clear standards for that water’s safe release, to help reduce the future accumulation of oil sands mine water.
- Recommendation 2 advises government to promote more water-sharing between mine sites to minimize new withdrawals from the Athabasca River.
- Recommendation 3 advises government to focus on managing oil sands mine water within the watershed, not across watersheds.
- Recommendation 4 advises government that deep well disposal be considered to manage low volumes of otherwise untreatable oil sands mine water and some legacy mine water, once all other options have been fully explored. Deep well disposal involves the underground injection of oil sands mine water beneath many layers of impermeable rock, protecting drinking water sources.
- Recommendation 5 calls for a standardized method to be developed for measuring naphthenic acids, naturally occurring organics that are sourced from oil sands bitumen. Though no jurisdiction is known to have ever implemented such a method for regulatory purposes, being able to measure them is considered essential in assessing the effectiveness of mine water treatment options.
The committee’s work continues, and more recommendations will be shared in the near future.

### Next steps

Alberta’s government accepts these recommendations and will immediately begin exploring them further to help create an accelerated plan to reclaim the water and eventually return the land for use by future generations.

The Alberta government will work with others to better understand these recommendations, carefully evaluate them and explore what would be needed to safely and realistically put them into action. Any approach for managing tailings ponds will be rooted in science and backed by clear research and evidence.

Alberta is committed to continue listening to Albertans and the people who brought forward solutions. The ongoing leadership and participation of Indigenous communities and others are vital to shaping how we manage oil sands mine water and tailings and protect the land and water for future generations.

More information will be shared as this important work continues.

## Committee presentations

Over a period of 12 months, the steering committee reviewed all relevant research and engaged with communities, industry and governments to ensure that many perspectives and potential solutions are considered in presenting solutions to this challenging issue.

Multiple presentations were made by technology developers, industry operators, Indigenous communities, governments and scientists. Where possible, presentations will be made publicly available in the future.

## Committee members

The Oil Sands Mine Water Steering Committee includes representatives from Indigenous and local communities, the oil sands mining industry, and tailings and academic experts.
