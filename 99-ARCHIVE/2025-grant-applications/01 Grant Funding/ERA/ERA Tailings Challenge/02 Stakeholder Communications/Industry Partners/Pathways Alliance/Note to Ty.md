**Subject:** Following up: A new, evidence-based path for the ERA Tailings Challenge

Hello Ty,

Hope you are doing well.

Following up on our conversations in May, I wanted to provide a significant update. The landscape for tailings remediation has evolved favourably since we last spoke, with two key pieces of research now published that create a clear, evidence-based opportunity for Pathways members.

First, the multi-year study on the Kearl constructed wetland has been published. It provides two critical insights for the industry: 1) It validates that wetlands are an effective foundational technology for NA degradation, but 2) it documents that degradation rates slow significantly over the season, identifying a key performance gap.

Second, our core biosensor technology has now been published in the peer-reviewed journal _ACS Synthetic Biology_. In our work at the Kearl pilot, our biosensor performance was comparable to mass spectrometry, confirming we have a rapid, cost-effective tool to manage these systems with high-resolution data.

This is where our platform creates a powerful opportunity for your members. It is uniquely designed to solve the exact challenges identified in the Kearl report. We use our rapid biosensors to close the data gap caused by infrequent testing, and our bioaugmentation service can directly address the performance slowdown in wetlands.

We are building strong momentum to execute on this. We have already aligned with Dr. Doug Muench at the UofC (one of the leaders on the Kearl project) and with Innotech Alberta to use their existing infrastructure for our pilot, making it a highly capital-efficient plan.

As you know, ERA has now launched the Tailings Technology Challenge, which is a perfect fit for this project. We are preparing our submission and believe a partnership with Pathways Alliance would create an exceptionally strong proposal that benefits the entire sector.

Would you have 30-45 minutes for a call next week? We would like to walk you through our scoped ERA project and discuss how we can best position this for success with you and your members.

Regards,

**Jeff**
