# Luminous BioSolutions - ERA Tailings Technology Challenge

## The Problem We've Been Working On Together

Naphthenic acids (NAs) are the most persistent barrier to tailings water treatment and land reclamation since the origin of oil sands mining. There is an urgent need for strategies to reduce NA levels and toxicity in tailings facilities, prior to any regulated water release. This problem is causing an increased environmental and financial liability, with growing pressure from communities demanding solutions.

Without breakthrough approaches, tailings ponds continue expanding indefinitely while liability costs escalate and social license erodes. Traditional monitoring methods are too slow, expensive, and complex for effective NA management, while treatment approaches struggle to achieve low, non-toxic levels.

Through CNR's $500K investment (including matching funds) over the last decade, we've worked exclusively on this challenge. Our research has yielded promising developments that offer an inexpensive, novel approach to address this problem.

## What We've Learned & Developed

**Monitoring Breakthrough (CNR-Funded):** We've developed and field-tested biosensors (Kearl Wetland Pilot) that accurately detect NA presence and concentration quickly, simply, and cost-effectively delivering results with 24 hrs comparable to mass spectrometry, as opposed to weeks.

**Addressing Toxicity:** This ERA project includes developing a new toxicity biosensor measuring membrane damage (narcosis), providing clearer answers to regulatory and community questions about water safety.

**Key Discovery:** Our biosensor can rapidly identify naturally occurring bacteria from tailings wastewater that efficiently break down NAs. These native bacteria offer a biological solution working complementary to many water treatment processes (constructed wetlands, pit lakes, etc.).

## A Potential Path Forward

**Bioaugmentation Strategy:** We will identify a minimal, optimal NA degrading community of native OSPW bacteria to apply to water treatment processes as an inexpensive, environmentally friendly approach to remediate NAs, addressing both PPM and toxicity concerns that have stalled progress.

**Integrated Platform:**

- **Rapid monitoring** for NA concentration, toxicity, and treatment progress in near real-time
- **Biological breakdown** using addition of native bacteria to reduce NA concentration and toxicity
- **Continuous validation** to monitor progress and inform decisions
- **Data transparency** to build stakeholder confidence

## Project Timeline

- **Phase 1 (Months 1-24):** Microbial NA degrading community optimization (Dr Shawn Lewenza) and greenhouse mesocosms validation of bioaugmentation at University of Calgary using industry OSPW samples (Dr Doug Muench)
- **Phase 2 (Months 18-36):** Large-scale bacterial cultivation and outdoor mesocosm pilot of bioaugmentation at InnoTech Alberta (5,000-15,000L)
- **Phase 3 (Months 36-48):** Commercial deployment preparation

## Field Application

- Complement and expand NA testing capacity across CNR operations
- Bioaugment to improve existing constructed wetlands/pit lakes and future water treatment systems
- Provide standardized measurement methods (Oil Sands Mine Water Steering Committee Recommendation 5)
- Achieve non-toxic NA levels required for water release and land reclamation

## Cost & Schedule

- **Total Project:** $8,016,150 over 4 years
- **ERA Contribution:** 50% ($4,008,075)
- **CNR's Share:** $1,336,692 over 4 years (~$334,173 annually) assuming 3-operator partnership
- **CNR Commitments:** OSPW samples, technical input (no facility access required)
- **Payment:** Milestone-based funding

## Research Team

- **Dr. Shawn Lewenza:** Lead scientist, 10+ years NA focus, biosensor inventor
- **Dr. Doug Muench:** Kearl engineered wetland project lead, mesocosm expertise
- **Ralph Hindle (Vogon Labs):** Mass spectrometry validation services
- **InnoTech Alberta:** Mesocosm facilities and bacterial cultivation
- **Greg Saunders:** Data platform development

## Why This Partnership Makes Sense

CNR's biosensor investment has proven successful. This project logically extends that work to address the broader remediation challenge it was originally designed to solve. Using naturally occurring bacteria requires minimal infrastructure, generates no waste streams, and operates with low energy intensity while providing rigorous validation against established analytical methods.

Rather than each operator developing separate solutions, this collaborative approach leverages shared expertise, reduces individual risk, and addresses the challenge all three operators face.
