Hi Jason, Thank you for your response and interest in reviewing our technology. I've attached our technology overview slide deck and a technical summary document for your review. 

Our solution addresses the challenging oil sands tailings management issue: monitoring and remediating naphthenic acids (NAs). We've developed a three-component integrated approach: 

1. Rapid biosensor monitoring technology that detects NAs in minutes versus weeks with traditional lab methods 
2. Targeted bioaugmentation using native bacteria specifically adapted to degrade NAs 
3. Data analytics platform that provides actionable insights from monitoring data 

This solution can help CNR address your persistent NA remediating challenges in your tailings ponds. We believe this is a solution that can accelerate the reclamation timelines and help get the water to acceptable release levels. 

CNR has already generously provided academic funding for the development of our bacterial Biosensor. The success of this development is accelerating our bioaugmentation strategy. Luminous BioSolutions has been formed to commercialize the technology and accelerate our time to market. 

We're currently preparing an application for the ERA Industrial Transformation Challenge 2025 (deadline June 12), and we're seeking support from industry partners. CNR having already invested in our technology, and CNR's operational insights would be invaluable to ensuring our solution addresses oil sands operators Tailings ponds NA remediation needs. 

We apologize about the urgency, but with this submission being June 12, we want to ensure all support is in place. We **do not require any formal commitments** as this is just an expression of interest, but a brief letter indicating CNR's interest and potential future collaboration would be very helpful for our application. 

Would you be available for a brief Teams call this week to discuss our technology in more detail? I have availability Thursday afternoon or Friday morning, but we can certainly work around your schedule if those times don't work. 

Looking forward to your response,
