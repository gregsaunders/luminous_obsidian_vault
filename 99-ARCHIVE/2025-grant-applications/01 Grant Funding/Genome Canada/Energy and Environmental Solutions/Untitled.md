### Overview

Genomics is a big data science that allows us to study the genetic material in all living things. Leveraging machine learning and AI tools allows us to understand how things function at a molecular level including how microbes contribute to environmental processes like remediation and reclamation or consume methane and convert it into less harmful emissions.

While genomics science continues to advance at a rapid pace, the broadscale adoption of these technology solutions in the energy sector is growing but still limited. We are looking to accelerate the benefits of technology adoption and support a greener energy future.

Genome Alberta, with support from the Government of Alberta, is investing in new research collaborations to close the gap in scaling genomic innovations in support of broader application in Alberta’s energy sector for improved environmental outcomes. 

The **Genomic Innovations: Energy and Environmental Solutions**initiative will fund genomics-based research projects that aim to accelerate the development of adoptable outputs—products, processes, or applications derived from genomics technologies with clear potential for implementation within the energy sector. Applications will be accepted for projects  that will help in reducing or assessing the environmental impact of energy operations and will promote environmental stewardship, including the areas of:

- Bioremediation and reclamation of contaminated sites
- GHG emission reduction via microbial processes or bio-based carbon capture
- Biodiversity assessment and ecological monitoring using eDNA tools
- Clean technology development (e.g. hydrogen production, carbon storage)
- Optimization of processes that limit environmental risk (e.g. corrosion prevention, water treatment)

### Application Process

There is a two-stage application process. Applicants are required to submit an Expression of Interest form for review. Selected projects from the EOI stage will be invited to submit a Full Application.

In the Expression of Interest [form](https://ln5.sync.com/4.0/dl/040914d30#jeb2pfsa-c9fpk9ha-ihgd8fq5-5ka7znz6), applicants will be required to briefly describe:

- The current limitation(s) in the energy sector that the project aims to solve;
- The proposed (genomics-based) adoptable output(s) to help support the energy sector’s challenge(s);
- The multidisciplinary consortia approach that will involve appropriate energy sector stakeholders; and
- The value proposition through impact metrics.
