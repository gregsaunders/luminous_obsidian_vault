**Updated:** September 24, 2025  
**Strategy Focus:** Commercial pilot acquisition and revenue generation  
**Target Market:** Alberta oil sands operators  
**Methodology:** Gap Selling framework with regulatory timing advantage  

## **Business Context & Opportunity**

**Market Timing:** OSMWSC September 2025 recommendations create regulatory pressure for improved naphthenic acid monitoring  
**Value Proposition:** 24-hour results vs 6-8 week HRMS turnaround, 92% correlation accuracy  
**Pricing Strategy:** $15K-$50K commercial pilots leading to long-term monitoring contracts  
**Cultural Approach:** Authentic Calgary startup positioning, relationship-focused engagement  

## **Existing Directory Structure Utilization**

**Leverage optimized structure (no new folders needed):**

## **Primary Automation Objectives**

### **1. Target 20 Customer Campaign Acceleration**
**Goal:** Convert research into paying pilot customers within 90 days

**Automated Tasks:**
- Generate company-specific Gap Selling conversation frameworks
- Create regulatory compliance narratives for each target company
- Develop pilot program ROI calculators with company-specific data
- Automate competitive positioning materials (speed vs accuracy advantage)
- Generate follow-up sequences for warm relationships (CNRL, Imperial Oil, Suncor)

### **2. Regulatory Timing Advantage Exploitation**
**Goal:** Position Luminous as early regulatory compliance solution

**Automated Tasks:**
- Generate OSMWSC recommendation compliance talking points
- Create "early adopter advantage" positioning materials
- Develop regulatory risk mitigation narratives
- Automate Alberta government stakeholder identification
- Generate regulatory timeline pressure point materials

### **3. Relationship Nurturing and Conversion**
**Goal:** Convert existing warm contacts to pilot commitments

**Automated Tasks:**
- Generate Gap Selling progression tracking for each contact
- Create authentic follow-up sequences (Calgary business culture)
- Develop technical credibility reinforcement materials
- Automate meeting preparation briefs for each contact
- Generate pilot proposal customization templates

### Critical Information I Need From You:

1. **Your technical data specifics** - What are your actual correlation coefficients with Mass Spec? Detection limits? Accuracy rates?
    
2. **Your contact lists** - Do you have existing contacts in regulatory, academic, or industry spheres?
    
3. **Your content assets** - What presentations, papers, or materials do you already have?
    
4. **Your time availability** - How many hours per week can you dedicate to this awareness campaign?
    
5. **Your technical comfort level** - Are you comfortable with CSV files, basic scripting, email automation?
    

### Claude Code Prompting Strategy:

**Initial Setup Prompt:** "I need you to act as my environmental technology awareness campaign manager. Help me build and maintain a systematic outreach program for naphthenic acid biosensor technology. Create content calendars, track engagement, and generate materials for academic, regulatory, community, and industry audiences."

**Weekly Management Prompt:** "Review my outreach tracker, identify this week's priorities, generate needed content, and update my contact database with new opportunities."

### Honest Reality Check:

Claude Code is excellent for content generation and organization, but limited for actual outreach automation (no email sending, social media posting, etc.). You'll still need to manually execute most communications.

The real value will be in content creation, organization, and systematic tracking - not full automation.

Before proceeding, I need those five pieces of information to create specific, actionable Claude Code instructions. Without your actual data and constraints, any automation plan will be theoretical rather than practical.
