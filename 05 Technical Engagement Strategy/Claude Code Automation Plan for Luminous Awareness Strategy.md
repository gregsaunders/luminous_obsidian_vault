### File Structure Setup

First, create this directory structure for Claude Code to work with:

```
/luminous-awareness/
├── content-library/
│   ├── research-papers/
│   ├── case-studies/
│   ├── blog-posts/
│   ├── webinar-materials/
│   └── regulatory-submissions/
├── contact-databases/
│   ├── regulatory-contacts.csv
│   ├── academic-contacts.csv
│   ├── community-contacts.csv
│   └── industry-contacts.csv
├── templates/
│   ├── email-templates/
│   ├── blog-post-templates/
│   └── presentation-templates/
├── automation-scripts/
└── tracking/
    ├── outreach-log.csv
    ├── publication-tracker.csv
    └── engagement-metrics.csv
```

### Critical Information I Need From You:

1. **Your technical data specifics** - What are your actual correlation coefficients with Mass Spec? Detection limits? Accuracy rates?
    
2. **Your contact lists** - Do you have existing contacts in regulatory, academic, or industry spheres?
    
3. **Your content assets** - What presentations, papers, or materials do you already have?
    
4. **Your time availability** - How many hours per week can you dedicate to this awareness campaign?
    
5. **Your technical comfort level** - Are you comfortable with CSV files, basic scripting, email automation?
    

### Claude Code Prompting Strategy:

**Initial Setup Prompt:** "I need you to act as my environmental technology awareness campaign manager. Help me build and maintain a systematic outreach program for naphthenic acid biosensor technology. Create content calendars, track engagement, and generate materials for academic, regulatory, community, and industry audiences."

**Weekly Management Prompt:** "Review my outreach tracker, identify this week's priorities, generate needed content, and update my contact database with new opportunities."

### Honest Reality Check:

Claude Code is excellent for content generation and organization, but limited for actual outreach automation (no email sending, social media posting, etc.). You'll still need to manually execute most communications.

The real value will be in content creation, organization, and systematic tracking - not full automation.

Before proceeding, I need those five pieces of information to create specific, actionable Claude Code instructions. Without your actual data and constraints, any automation plan will be theoretical rather than practical.
