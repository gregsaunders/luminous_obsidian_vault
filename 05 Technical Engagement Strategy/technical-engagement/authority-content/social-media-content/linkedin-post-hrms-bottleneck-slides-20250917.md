### Text for LinkedIn Post Body (Short Intro)

New oilsands regulations will demand a massive increase in water monitoring. This creates a critical data bottleneck that the current gold standard, High Resolution Mass Spectrometry (HRMS), wasn't built to handle.

The result? A backlog of samples and data that's weeks to months too late to be actionable.

We believe the solution lies in complementing precision with speed and scale. See our 3-slide overview on how we can break the monitoring bottleneck and build a data-driven path to reclamation.

#### **Slide 1: The Emerging Data Bottleneck**

The government's new action plan for oilsands tailings will require a significant increase in monitoring frequency and volume. This poses a critical question: can the current gold standard, High-Resolution Mass Spectrometry (HRMS), scale to meet this demand?

While unparalleled in precision, HRMS was not designed for the cost, speed, or throughput required for high-frequency operational monitoring. The impending surge in sample volume threatens to create an unmanageable backlog, with results arriving weeks too late to effectively guide active remediation efforts.

**This data gap is the critical bottleneck to achieving verifiable reclamation.**

#### **Slide 2: The Solution: High-Throughput Bioscreening**

Our approach is to complement the precision of HRMS with a scalable, high-throughput screening tier.

**Luminous BioSolutions' peer-reviewed Biosensors** provide quantitative analysis of Naphthenic Acids within 24 hours, enabling cost-effective, operational-scale monitoring for the first time.

This stream of high-frequency data feeds our **Confluent platform**, providing a near real-time, auditable dataset on remediation efficacy. This allows for adaptive management of treatment systems and gives regulators the transparent data they require.

#### **Slide 3: The Outcome: A Data-Driven Path to Reclamation**

By integrating rapid bioscreening with a robust data platform, we can break the monitoring bottleneck and build a more agile, data-driven, and trustworthy path to reclamation.
