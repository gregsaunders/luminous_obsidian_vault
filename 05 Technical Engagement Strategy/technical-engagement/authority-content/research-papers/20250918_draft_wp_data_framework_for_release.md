# DRAFT: A New Capability in Water Monitoring: A Data Framework for the Next Phase of Tailings Management

---

## **Section 1: The Evolving Regulatory Landscape and the Data Challenge**

For decades, the management of oil sands tailings has been defined by a single, overarching principle: containment. However, the landscape is now undergoing a fundamental shift. On September 5, 2025, the Alberta government announced its intention to create standards for the release of treated tailings water into the environment, signaling a clear policy direction for the future of reclamation.

This move is supported by the recommendations of the Oil Sands Mine Water Steering Committee (OSMWSC), which has described the eventual treatment and release of tailings water as "essential" for managing the growing volumes and enabling sustainable closure of mine sites.

This clear policy direction—moving from long-term containment to a framework of active treatment and regulated release—raises a critical question for all stakeholders: How can we ensure this process is safe, verifiable, and worthy of public and community trust?

The success of this new paradigm hinges on the ability to prove that water treatment technologies are effective. This requires a density and frequency of water quality data that has not been previously achievable. To manage a treatment system and provide regulators with the confidence needed to approve a release, operators must be able to track performance in near real-time.

This creates a data gap. Traditional lab-based monitoring methods, while essential for detailed forensic analysis, were not designed for the operational cadence or cost structure required to generate high-frequency data. Relying on results that take weeks to arrive makes proactive process control and transparent verification difficult. A new capability is needed to provide the right data at the right speed to support this new phase of tailings management.
