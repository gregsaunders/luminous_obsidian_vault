# DRAFT: A New Capability in Water Monitoring: A Data Framework for the Next Phase of Tailings Management

---

## **Section 1: The Evolving Regulatory Landscape and the Data Challenge**

For decades, the management of oil sands tailings has been defined by a single, overarching principle: containment. However, the landscape is now undergoing a fundamental shift. On September 5, 2025, the Alberta government announced its intention to create standards for the release of treated tailings water into the environment, signaling a clear policy direction for the future of reclamation.

This move is supported by the recommendations of the Oil Sands Mine Water Steering Committee (OSMWSC), which has described the eventual treatment and release of tailings water as "essential" for managing the growing volumes and enabling sustainable closure of mine sites.

This clear policy direction—moving from long-term containment to a framework of active treatment and regulated release—raises a critical question for all stakeholders: How can we ensure this process is safe, verifiable, and worthy of public and community trust?

The success of this new paradigm hinges on the ability to prove that water treatment technologies are effective. This requires a density and frequency of water quality data that has not been previously achievable. To manage a treatment system and provide regulators with the confidence needed to approve a release, operators must be able to track performance in near real-time.

This creates a data gap. Traditional lab-based monitoring methods, while essential for detailed forensic analysis, were not designed for the operational cadence or cost structure required to generate high-frequency data. Relying on results that take weeks to arrive makes proactive process control and transparent verification difficult. A new capability is needed to provide the right data at the right speed to support this new phase of tailings management.

## **Section 2: A New Monitoring Capability: High-Frequency Biosensing**

Addressing the data gap in tailings management requires a tool that is not only scientifically robust but also operationally practical. The Luminous BioSolutions platform is a new, commercially-available capability designed to meet this need. It combines two integrated components: a panel of proprietary biosensors for rapid field analysis and the Confluent data platform for turning that analysis into actionable intelligence.

Our approach is centered on a panel of whole-cell biosensors—engineered microorganisms that produce a measurable light-based signal in the presence of specific classes of Naphthenic Acids (NAs). This technology, validated in peer-reviewed journals including *ACS Synthetic Biology*, moves the analysis from a remote laboratory to a near-field environment, enabling a much faster and more efficient monitoring cadence.

The key technical advantages of this platform include:

*   **Timeliness:** The biosensor platform provides quantitative results within 24 hours, a significant acceleration compared to the multi-week turnaround common for traditional lab-based methods. This allows operators to understand their water quality on an operational timescale.

*   **Specificity:** The platform utilizes a panel of distinct biosensors, each tailored to different classes of NAs (e.g., acyclic vs. complex ringed structures). This provides a level of compositional insight that non-specific methods like FTIR cannot, helping to identify the nature of the contaminants being treated.

*   **Operational Viability:** The system is designed for high-throughput analysis with minimal sample preparation. This reduces logistical complexity and lowers the overall cost-per-sample, making frequent monitoring economically feasible for the first time.

*   **Field-Validated Performance:** Beyond academic journals, the platform has been deployed in a large-scale, multi-season validation study at an oil sands constructed wetland pilot. In this real-world environment, the biosensor data demonstrated a strong correlation with results from conventional HRMS analysis. These findings are currently being prepared for peer-reviewed publication.

By providing a reliable, rapid, and specific stream of data, this new capability offers a practical way to generate the evidence needed to track treatment efficacy, optimize processes, and build the comprehensive data package required for regulatory review.
