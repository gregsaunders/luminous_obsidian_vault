# Technical Brief: A Field-Validated Platform for High-Frequency Monitoring of Naphthenic Acids in Oil Sands Process Water

---

## **1. Abstract**

This brief presents performance data for a new, peer-reviewed biosensor platform (*ACS Synthetic Biology*, 2024) designed to address the operational need for high-frequency monitoring of naphthenic acids (NAs) in oil sands process water (OSPW). In controlled mesocosm studies, the platform demonstrated a strong correlation (R values between -0.97 and -0.99, p < 0.00) with Orbitrap MS for tracking NA degradation. In a subsequent large-scale field pilot, the platform showed strong qualitative agreement with HRMS trends. The system provides quantitative results from raw OSPW samples within 24 hours, with detection limits ranging from 2-30 mg/L depending on the specific biosensor used.

## **2. The Operational Need for High-Frequency Data**

The evolving regulatory landscape, including the Alberta government's stated intention to create standards for releasing treated tailings, requires proof that water treatment technologies are effective. This necessitates a frequency of water quality data that traditional lab-based methods, with their multi-week turnaround times, were not designed to provide. This data gap makes proactive management of treatment systems difficult and creates operational "blind spots." A new capability is needed to provide data at the speed and scale required for this next phase of tailings management.

## **3. Platform Performance & Validation Data**

The following performance data was summarized in a technical presentation by Dr. Shawn Lewenza (Athabasca University/University of Calgary).

**3.1. Biosensor Panel & Detection Limits**

The platform utilizes a panel of three distinct biosensors, each with a defined sensitivity for different classes of NAs:

*   **p3680-lux (Classic NAs):** 2-4 mg/L
*   **marR-lux (Complex NAs):** 7-15 mg/L
*   **atuA-lux (Acyclic NAs):** 15-30 mg/L

**3.2. Performance in Oil Sands Process Water (OSPW)**

A key challenge for any monitoring tool is performance in the complex OSPW matrix. In validation studies, the biosensor panel demonstrated a high success rate with minimal sample preparation:

*   **Raw OSPW Samples:** Successfully detected NAs in 22 out of 24 unique raw OSPW samples.

**3.3. Correlation with Mass Spectrometry**

The platform's performance has been rigorously compared against "gold standard" Orbitrap Mass Spectrometry.

*   **Controlled Mesocosm Studies:** In greenhouse mesocosm studies tracking NA degradation, the biosensor data showed an extremely strong and statistically significant correlation with Orbitrap MS results, with correlation coefficients (R) ranging from **-0.97 to -0.99 (p < 0.00)**.

*   **Large-Scale Field Pilot:** In a subsequent multi-season study at a large-scale constructed wetland, the platform demonstrated strong **qualitative agreement and visual concordance** with mass spectrometry. The biosensors successfully tracked the reduction of total NAs from ~70 mg/L to below the platform's signal loss threshold of ~32-36 mg/L, mirroring the trend data obtained from MS analysis.

**3.4. Summary of Demonstrated Capabilities**

*   **Turnaround Time:** 24 hours for quantitative screening results.
*   **Matrix Compatibility:** Proven to work directly in raw OSPW with minimal sample preparation.
*   **Validation:** Performance trends show strong correlation and qualitative agreement with HRMS.
*   **Format:** Scalable from single tubes to 96-well plates for high-throughput analysis.

## **4. Application: The Confluent Data Platform**

The challenge of data timeliness is compounded by the issue of data volume. The coming regulations will require a significant increase in testing frequency across numerous locations, generating a volume of data that traditional tools like spreadsheets are ill-equipped to handle. 

The Luminous platform is designed to solve this data management problem. Our **Confluent data platform** is an open and integrated hub that moves beyond spreadsheets. It not only visualizes the high-frequency biosensor data but also allows for the seamless integration of other relevant datasets, including results from periodic HRMS analysis or data from other process sensors. This consolidates monitoring data into a single, auditable system designed for the scale of the challenge ahead.

## **5. A Collaborative Path Forward**

The transition from containment to regulated release is a complex challenge that no single technology can solve alone. Success will require a collaborative effort between operators, regulators, community stakeholders, and technology providers.

Established analytical methods like HRMS will always be essential for their precision and forensic capabilities. The new capability offered by high-frequency biosensing is not a replacement for these methods, but a complementary tool designed to fill a specific, critical data gap. It is an important part of an integrated monitoring toolkit.

We believe the path forward is one of partnership and shared learning. We invite technical and strategic leaders for a confidential technical briefing. In this session, we can share our full validation data and discuss how this new monitoring capability can be integrated into your specific tailings management and reclamation strategies.
