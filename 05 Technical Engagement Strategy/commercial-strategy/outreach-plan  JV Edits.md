## 2. Draft Outreach Email to Suncor - Warm Re-engagement

**Subject:** Re-engaging Suncor's Environmental Innovation Team - Operationalizing Biosensor Technology

Dear [Suncor Environmental Team Contact],

I'm reaching out from Luminous BioSolutions regarding our naphthenic acid biosensor technology that Suncor previously supported with a $500,000 investment in the academic research phase.

Our primary contact at Suncor is currently on long-term leave, and we want to ensure we're connected with the right team as we transition from research to commercial deployment. The biosensor technology has now achieved significant milestones:

• **24-hour NA results** vs. current 6-8 week lab turnaround
• **92% correlation** with high-resolution mass spectrometry 
• **Field-validated** through the Kearl wetland monitoring program
• **Ready for operational deployment** in tailings and treatment monitoring

Given Suncor's leadership in environmental innovation and your previous investment in this technology, we'd like to discuss how to operationalize the biosensor for your current monitoring and treatment optimization needs.

Could you direct me to the best person on your tailings or environmental innovation team to explore a pilot program? We're currently offering 3-6 month operational pilots to validate the technology's value in real-world applications.

I'd be happy to provide a technical briefing on our progress since your initial investment and discuss how this technology could enhance your current monitoring capabilities.

Thank you for your continued interest in environmental innovation. I look forward to re-engaging with the appropriate team.

Best regards,

Jeff Violo

## 3. Draft Outreach Email to Imperial - Strategic Pivot from ERA TTC

**Subject:** Simplified Approach - Small Commercial Pilot Opportunity

Dear Carolina,

I hope you're doing well! I wanted to reach out with a strategic update following our recent ERA TTC conversations.

**Strategic Pivot:**
After the challenges with ERA funding timelines and the volume of partnership requests you've all been managing, we've made a deliberate pivot. We're stepping away from large grant partnerships and focusing on direct commercial validation through small, manageable pilots.

**What's Different:**
• **No grant funding complexity** - direct commercial arrangement
• **Minimal commitment** - 3-month pilot program ($20K-$30K range)
• **Operational focus** - validates real-world value for your teams
• **Complements BE-SPME** - enhances your ExxonMobil collaboration rather than competing

**The Simple Ask:**
A small pilot that demonstrates how 24-hour NA results complement your existing monitoring investments. Based on the Kearl efficiency decline patterns we observed, this could provide the operational intelligence Imperial needs for treatment optimization.

I know how inundated you've been with TTC partnership requests. This is different - it's a straightforward commercial pilot designed to prove value with minimal operational impact.

Would you be interested in a brief call to discuss this simplified approach? Given your earlier enthusiasm for our commercialization progress and your offer to facilitate COSIA connections, I think this could be a strong win-win opportunity.

No pressure if the timing isn't right - I understand how busy this period has been for everyone.

Best regards,

## 4. Draft Outreach Email to CNRL - Acknowledging ERA TTC Rejection

**Subject:** New Direction - Small Commercial Pilot (No Grant Funding)

Dear Theo,

I hope you're doing well! I wanted to reach out with an update on our approach following the ERA TTC discussions.

**Acknowledging Recent Context:**
I completely understand CNRL's decision on the ERA partnership - I know you've been inundated with TTC requests, and the budget timing for 2026 just wasn't aligned. No hard feelings at all!

**Strategic Pivot:**
We've made a deliberate decision to step away from grant funding partnerships and focus on direct commercial validation. This removes all the complexity and timing challenges of large-scale funded projects.

**The New Approach:**
• **Small commercial pilot** - 3-month program ($15K-$25K range)
• **No grant funding complexity** - straightforward commercial arrangement  
• **Minimal operational impact** - validates real-world value without major commitment
• **Leverages CNR's decade of investment** - natural progression from research to operational deployment

**Technology Ready for Deployment:**
• **24-hour NA results** vs. current 6-8 week lab turnaround
• **92% correlation** with mass spectrometry (validated through Kearl project)
• **Direct operational value** for your active remediation programs

Given CNRL's long history with this technology and your focus on operational efficiency, would you be interested in discussing this simplified approach? It's designed to prove value with minimal risk and commitment.

I know the timing is much better than large funding partnerships, and it might align well with your current operational priorities.

## 5. COSIA/Pathways Strategy - Pivot from Grant Funding to Commercial Validation

### **Revised Approach for Tyler Veness Engagement**

**Context Update:** Previous ERA funding attempts have been challenging due to internal processes and competing priorities. Need to pivot to commercial approach.

**New Strategic Message:** "Simple commercial validation opportunity - no grant complexity"

**Proposed Engagement Strategy:**
Acknowledge the challenges with previous funding approaches and present a streamlined commercial alternative. Frame as a low-complexity way for Pathways Alliance members to evaluate promising Canadian technology.

**Revised Multi-Operator Proposal:**
- **Program Duration:** 3-6 months focused commercial validation
- **Investment:** $75K-$100K shared across 3-4 member companies  
- **Value Proposition:** Validate technology value with minimal internal complexity
- **No Grant Dependencies:** Direct commercial arrangement, faster decision-making

**Key Messaging Changes:**
- Acknowledge previous funding challenges and internal circulation complexity
- Emphasize simplified commercial approach vs. grant partnership requirements
- Focus on operational value demonstration rather than research collaboration
- Position as member service rather than funding opportunity

**Tyler Engagement Approach:**
"Following the ERA funding challenges, we've pivoted to direct commercial validation. This removes the grant complexity that made previous discussions difficult and provides members with a straightforward way to evaluate breakthrough monitoring technology."
