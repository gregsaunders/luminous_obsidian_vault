## 2. Draft Outreach Email to Suncor - Warm Re-engagement

**Subject:** Re-engaging Suncor's Environmental Innovation Team - Operationalizing Biosensor Technology

Dear [Suncor Environmental Team Contact],

I hope this message finds you well. I'm reaching out from Luminous BioSolutions regarding our naphthenic acid biosensor technology that Suncor previously supported with a $500,000 investment in the academic research phase.

Our primary contact at Suncor is currently on long-term leave, and we want to ensure we're connected with the right team as we transition from research to commercial deployment. The biosensor technology has now achieved significant milestones:

• **24-hour NA results** vs. current 6-8 week lab turnaround
• **92% correlation** with high-resolution mass spectrometry 
• **Field-validated** through the Kearl wetland monitoring program
• **Ready for operational deployment** in tailings and treatment monitoring

Given Suncor's leadership in environmental innovation and your previous investment in this technology, we'd like to discuss how to operationalize the biosensor for your current monitoring and treatment optimization needs.

Could you direct me to the best person on your tailings or environmental innovation team to explore a pilot program? We're currently offering 3-6 month operational pilots to validate the technology's value in real-world applications.

I'd be happy to provide a technical briefing on our progress since your initial investment and discuss how this technology could enhance your current monitoring capabilities.

Thank you for your continued interest in environmental innovation. I look forward to re-engaging with the appropriate team.

Best regards,

Jeff Violo  
COO, Luminous BioSolutions

## 3. Draft Outreach Email to Imperial - Strategic Positioning

**Subject:** Enhancing Kearl's Monitoring Capabilities - Complementary Biosensor Technology

Dear Carolina,

I hope you're doing well! It's been great working with Imperial Oil on the Kearl wetland project, where our collaboration has provided valuable insights into naphthenic acid monitoring and treatment optimization.

As we transition our biosensor technology from research to commercial deployment, I wanted to reach out to discuss how it could complement and enhance the monitoring investments Imperial is already making, particularly with technologies like BESPEM.

Our biosensor technology has achieved some significant milestones that could provide immediate operational value:

• **24-hour NA screening results** for real-time treatment optimization
• **High-frequency monitoring** to complement your existing analytical methods  
• **Operational intelligence** that bridges the gap between weekly/monthly sampling
• **Cost-effective screening** that enables more frequent decision-making

Rather than replacing your current monitoring approaches, our biosensor serves as a **rapid screening tool** that helps you:
- Optimize when to deploy more expensive analytical methods
- Make faster operational decisions on treatment system adjustments
- Provide more frequent data for stakeholder reporting and compliance

Given Imperial's leadership position and commitment to environmental excellence, we'd like to discuss a strategic pilot program that could demonstrate how high-frequency biosensor data enhances the effectiveness of your existing monitoring investments.

Would you be interested in a brief call to explore how this technology could add value to Imperial's current operations? We're currently offering pilot programs specifically designed for premium operators who want to validate innovative monitoring approaches.

I look forward to continuing our productive collaboration.

Best regards,

Jeff Violo

## 4. Draft Outreach Email to CNRL - Warm Relationship

**Subject:** Luminous BioSolutions - Commercial Deployment of Biosensor Technology

Dear Theo,

I hope you're doing well! I wanted to reach out to re-introduce Luminous BioSolutions in a commercial context and share some exciting developments with our naphthenic acid biosensor technology.

As you may recall, we've been developing bacterial biosensors that can detect NAs in oil sands process water. The technology has now reached commercial readiness with some impressive capabilities:

• **24-hour results** vs. traditional 6-8 week lab turnaround  
• **Real-time monitoring** for treatment system optimization
• **92% correlation** with mass spectrometry validation
• **Field-proven** through wetland monitoring applications

Given CNRL's active remediation programs and focus on operational efficiency, our biosensor technology could provide significant value by:
- **Accelerating treatment decisions** with rapid NA feedback
- **Optimizing remediation processes** through high-frequency monitoring  
- **Reducing external lab dependencies** while maintaining data quality
- **Enabling proactive management** of treatment systems

We're currently offering pilot programs to validate the technology's operational value with leading operators. These 3-6 month pilots are designed to demonstrate clear ROI and integration with existing monitoring programs.

Would you be interested in discussing how this technology could enhance CNRL's current remediation efforts? I'd be happy to provide a technical briefing and explore potential pilot opportunities that align with your operational priorities.

I look forward to hearing from you and potentially working together in this new commercial phase.

Best regards,

## 5. COSIA/Pathways Multi-Operator Pilot Strategy

### **Strategic Approach for Ty Vaness Engagement**

**Objective:** Position Luminous for a multi-operator validation program through COSIA/Pathways Alliance

**Key Message:** "Cost-effective industry collaboration to validate breakthrough monitoring technology"

**Proposed Engagement Strategy:**
Reach out to Ty Vaness with a **collaborative industry validation proposal** rather than a single-company sales pitch. Frame the engagement as an opportunity for Pathways Alliance members to collectively evaluate and validate a promising Canadian-developed technology at a fraction of individual company costs.

**Multi-Operator Pilot Proposal:**
- **Program Duration:** 6-12 months across multiple member sites
- **Investment:** $100K-$150K shared across 4-6 member companies
- **Value Proposition:** De-risk individual company technology adoption through shared validation
- **Deliverables:** Industry-wide performance validation, best practices documentation, and deployment recommendations

**Strategic Benefits for Pathways Alliance:**
- Demonstrate collaborative innovation leadership
- Provide members with validated technology options
- Support Canadian cleantech development and commercialization  
- Generate industry-wide data on monitoring technology effectiveness

**Next Steps:** Schedule initial discussion with Ty Vaness to present the collaborative validation concept and gauge interest in developing a formal multi-operator pilot proposal.
