## 2. Draft Outreach Email to Suncor - Cold Introduction

**Subject:** Startup biosensor tech - closing the monitoring gap between FTIR and mass spec

Hi [Suncor Contact],

Hope you're doing well! I'm Jeff from Luminous BioSolutions - we're a Calgary startup commercializing some pretty interesting NA biosensor technology.

You know that frustrating choice everyone faces between FTIR's speed (but no specificity) and mass spec's accuracy (but weeks of turnaround)? We think we've found something that bridges that gap.

24-hour turnaround with real NA specificity - 92% correlation with HRMS, which honestly surprised us. We're seeing strong performance in head-to-head comparisons and avoiding the humic/fulvic acid interference that plagues FTIR.

With all the regulatory discussion around monitoring lately, seems like having more options in the toolkit might be useful. We're not trying to replace your existing approaches - more about filling that operational monitoring gap.

We're a small team trying to figure out where we fit in the bigger picture, so input from someone with Suncor's operational experience would be incredibly valuable.

Could you point me toward the right person for a technical conversation? Would love to share what we're seeing and get some expert feedback on whether this makes sense for real-world monitoring challenges.

Cheers,
Jeff

## 3. Draft Outreach Email to Imperial - Kearl Results Ready

**Subject:** Kearl results are in - better than we hoped!

Hi Carolina,

Hope you're doing well! We're finally ready to publish our Kearl findings and honestly, the head-to-head results against HRMS turned out better than we anticipated.

I know you mentioned Imperial's investment in BESPME for toxicity measurement. That got me thinking about where our biosensor might fit in your monitoring approach. We're not trying to compete with BESPME - more curious about whether there's a complementary role for rapid NA-specific screening.

The Kearl data shows some interesting patterns around treatment efficiency that I think you'd find valuable. Plus, seeing how our biosensor performed against the gold standard mass spec was pretty encouraging.

I'd love to share the results with you and get your thoughts on whether this makes sense for Imperial's monitoring strategy. If you're not the right person for this conversation, totally understand - just point me in the right direction!

We're a small startup trying to figure out where we fit in the bigger picture, so input from someone with your experience would be incredibly helpful.

Up for a coffee sometime to chat through the data?

Cheers,
Jeff

## 4. Draft Outreach Email to CNRL - Theo Paradis

**Subject:** Following up post-ERA - different direction, same excitement

Hey Theo,

Hope things are going well! I know the ERA funding didn't work out - totally get it with all the competing priorities and budget timing.

We've been heads-down since then and honestly, some of the results we're getting are pretty exciting. Remember that monitoring gap between FTIR and mass spec that everyone lives with? We think we might have cracked something interesting.

24-hour turnaround with real NA specificity - not just picking up every carboxyl group like FTIR does. We're seeing 92% correlation with Orbitrap MS, which frankly surprised us. 

I know CNRL's been dealing with this monitoring trade-off for years. Given your team's long history with this tech and the expertise you've built up, I'd really value getting your take on what we're seeing.

No big funding ask this time - just genuinely curious if this direction makes sense to someone who knows the operational challenges as well as you do. Plus, with all the regulatory noise lately, seems like having more monitoring options might be useful.

Up for a quick chat sometime? Would love to show you the data and get your honest opinion.

Best,
Jeff

## 5. COSIA/Pathways Strategy - Pivot from Grant Funding to Commercial Validation

### **Revised Approach for Tyler Veness Engagement**

**Context Update:** Previous ERA funding attempts have been challenging due to internal processes and competing priorities. Need to pivot to commercial approach.

**New Strategic Message:** "Simple commercial validation opportunity - no grant complexity"

**Proposed Engagement Strategy:**
Acknowledge the challenges with previous funding approaches and present a streamlined commercial alternative. Frame as a low-complexity way for Pathways Alliance members to evaluate promising Canadian technology.

**Revised Multi-Operator Proposal:**
- **Program Duration:** 3-6 months focused commercial validation
- **Investment:** $75K-$100K shared across 3-4 member companies  
- **Value Proposition:** Validate technology value with minimal internal complexity
- **No Grant Dependencies:** Direct commercial arrangement, faster decision-making

**Key Messaging Changes:**
- Acknowledge previous funding challenges and internal circulation complexity
- Emphasize simplified commercial approach vs. grant partnership requirements
- Focus on operational value demonstration rather than research collaboration
- Position as member service rather than funding opportunity

**Tyler Engagement Approach:**
"Following the ERA funding challenges, we've pivoted to direct commercial validation. This removes the grant complexity that made previous discussions difficult and provides members with a straightforward way to evaluate breakthrough monitoring technology."

## Additional CNRL Contact Emails

### **Email to Jayne Rattray - Technical Discussion**

**Subject:** Interesting findings on NA specificity - would love your perspective

Hi Jayne,

Hope you're doing well! I'm Jeff from Luminous BioSolutions - we're the startup commercializing Shawn Lewenza's biosensor work that CNRL supported over the years.

We've been digging into something that I think you'd find technically interesting. You know how FTIR picks up everything with a carboxyl group? We've been running head-to-head comparisons with our biosensor against FTIR and HRMS, specifically looking at the fulvic and humic acid interference problem.

Our findings are pretty compelling - the biosensor shows strong specificity for actual NAs while avoiding the false positives that plague FTIR. Given your background, I'd really value your technical perspective on what we're seeing.

With all the regulatory chatter lately, I know everyone's thinking more about monitoring approaches. We're not trying to replace mass spec - more like filling that gap between FTIR's speed and HRMS accuracy.

Would you be up for a quick chat? I'd love to share our specificity data and get your thoughts on whether this makes technical sense for CNRL's monitoring needs. Honestly, we need feedback from someone with your expertise to make sure we're on the right track.

Cheers,
Jeff

### **Email to Joy Romero - Executive Update**

**Subject:** Update on biosensor progress - exciting developments

Hi Joy,

Hope you're doing well! Wanted to give you a quick update on how things have progressed since our ERA discussions and thank you again for connecting me with Theo and the team.

We've been heads-down on the technology side and honestly, the results have been better than expected. The biosensor is showing some really promising performance against mass spec - 92% correlation, which frankly surprised us.

I know CNRL invested in this technology over the years believing it could solve real operational challenges. Seeing it actually bridge that gap between FTIR and HRMS feels pretty rewarding - your team's early support made this possible.

We're a small startup trying to figure out where we fit, but having industry veterans like yourself who understood the vision early on means a lot. The connections you facilitated with Theo's team have been invaluable.

Just wanted to keep you in the loop on the progress. Really grateful for your continued support!

Best,
Jeff
