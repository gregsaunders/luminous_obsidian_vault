- Try LinkedIn outreach to same contacts as alternative channel

### If LinkedIn Engagement is Low (<40 total reactions)
- Adjust posting times (test 8AM, 12PM, 4PM)
- Add more visual content and questions
- Increase personal networking and comments on others' posts

### If Content Creation Falls Behind
- Simplify regulatory document to key bullet points
- Focus on outline quality over detailed content
- Prioritize Week 2 LinkedIn posts over whitepaper development
