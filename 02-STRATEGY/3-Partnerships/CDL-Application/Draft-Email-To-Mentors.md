# Draft Email to CDL Mentors

**To:** Dave, Doug, Jocelyn, Terence, Dennis
**Subject:** Luminous Pitch Materials + Intro Ask (Suncor/CNRL/Imperial)

Team,

Per Friday’s feedback, we have stripped the "academic" weight out of our materials. We are now focused entirely on the **$260K/year efficiency** and the **2027 Regulatory Baseline**.

**1. The "Spoon-Fed" Materials (Attached)**
We’ve created two assets to make introductions effortless for you:
*   **Luminous One-Pager (PDF):** A single-page sales sheet you can attach. No internal jargon, just the value prop and the grant offer.
*   **Forwarding Blurbs (Text):** Three copy-paste options (Executive, Operations, LinkedIn) so you don't have to draft emails from scratch.

**2. The Ask: Introductions**
We are ready to engage. We are specifically looking for introductions to:
*   **Suncor:** (Jocelyn) – Operations contacts relevant to Base Plant closure/water management.
*   **Imperial:** (Doug) – Contacts who can leverage the Kearl validation.
*   **CNRL:** (Network) – Operations leads at Albian.
*   **Pathways:** (Dave/Doug) – Kendall Dilling (strategic alignment).

**3. Our Protocol (Respecting Your Network)**
We know social capital is finite. If you make an introduction, we commit to the following:
*   **Your Rules:** Tell us how you want to play it (warm handoff, direct reach-out, or "ghost write" for you). We follow your lead.
*   **24-Hour Response:** We will reply to every intro within 24 hours.
*   **Closed Loops:** You won't be left wondering. We will update you on the outcome (Meeting booked / Pass) so you know your intro wasn't wasted.

We are ready to run.

Thanks,
Jeff
