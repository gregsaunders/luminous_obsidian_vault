## Agenda

### 1. Meeting Attendee Introductions

### 2. Sprint 2 Objectives Check (10 min)

**Confirm these are right:**

| Objective          | Target                                    | On Track?             |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| **1. Pilot**       | CNRL LOI for Q2 2026 deployment           | 🟡 Needs acceleration |
| **2. Fundraising** | Strategy aligning capital with milestones | 🟡 Needs acceleration |
| **3. Operations**  | Execution strategy for real-time feedback | 🟢 On track           |

**Questions:**
- Are these measurable enough for Session 2?
- Is 10 weeks realistic for CNRL LOI?
- Any red flags?

### 2. Pilot Economics Review (15 min)

**Dave Lee's feedback:** "Come in with financial and operational metrics... Make it easy for them to take the medicine."

**Our Pricing Strategy:**

| Element            | Approach                                                         |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Pricing model**  | Cost recovery (no profit margin)                                 |
| **Volume framing** | More samples = higher resolution insights (not per-test pricing) |
| **Grant matching** | ERA/Alberta Innovates 50% co-funding → CNRL pays half            |
| **ROI**            | $260k/year validated savings, [X]-month payback at pilot cost    |

**Cost Structure (Placeholders - need validation):**

| Cost Category | 9-Month Total |
|---------------|---------------|
| Lab consumables & materials | $[TBD] |
| Labor (analysis, reporting) | $[TBD] |
| Confluent platform setup | $[TBD] |
| **Total Pilot Cost** | **$[TBD]** |
| ERA/AI Grant Match (50%) | -$[TBD] |
| **CNRL Net Investment** | **$[TBD]** |

**Questions:**
- Does cost recovery + grant matching make sense as positioning?
- What's a pilot price point that signals commitment but doesn't require VP approval?
- Should we include risk reversal ("3/5 scenarios validated by Month 6 or we extend")?

---

### 3. Relationship Leverage for Objective 1 (15 min)

**Current CNRL contacts:**
- Theo Paradis (scientific gatekeeper)
- Jayne Rattray (needs to be convinced on specificity)
- JohnPaul Portelli, Jason Brannick
- Steve laut (CDL)

**Gap: Decision-maker access**
- Who signs the check?
- Who is "Trevor W" (Steve Laut mention)?

**Ask for Mentors:**
- Can you facilitate introductions at CNRL, Suncor, Pathways/COSIA and Imperial?
- Who in your network has operator decision-maker relationships?
- How do we leverage other mentors for introductions?

**Other relationship asks:**
- Engineering firms (Stantec, Integrated Sustainability)
- Regulatory contacts (AER)
- Non-dilutive funding (Christophe at ERA, Mark at AI)

---

### 4. Priority Actions for Weeks 1-4 (10 min)

**My top priorities:**

| Week | Action | Owner |
|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Complete COSIA call with Ty Veness | Jeff |
| 1 | Finalize pilot pricing with Greg/Shawn | Jeff |
| 2 | Mike Lipsett test planning session | Jeff |
| 2 | Operator 1-pager with Max Zhang | Jeff/Max |
| 3-4 | Submit ERA/AI grant applications | Jeff |
| 4 | Finalize pilot scope document | Jeff/Greg |

**Questions:**
- Is this the right sequencing?
- What am I missing?
- Where can mentors accelerate these?

---

### 5. Next Steps & Mentor Kickoff (5 min)

- Full mentor team kickoff (Doodle sent - early December target)
- Max Zhang project scope (Tuesday call complete)
- Session 2 date confirmation

---

## Pre-Read for Jocelyn (Optional)

- **Pilot Proposal V1.4:** `pilot-Proposal-integrated-water-readiness-infrastructure-V1.4.md`
- **Sprint 2 Objectives:** `Sprint-2-Objectives-Draft.md`
- **Sprint 2 Tracker:** `Sprint-2-Tracker.md`

## My Talking Points

### On Pricing Strategy:
"We're positioning this as cost recovery with grant matching. CNRL gets a $260k/year ROI system for half our actual costs. There's no vendor margin to negotiate - we're investing in the relationship to prove the value."

### On Timeline Pressure:
"We have 10 weeks to LOI. That's aggressive for a major operator. I need mentor help to get to decision-makers faster than cold outreach would allow."

### On Dave's Feedback:
"Dave said 'make it easy for them to take the medicine.' Our proposal now includes: specific pricing, 9-month timeline with milestones, zero-friction deployment, and validated $260k ROI. What's missing?"
