Team,

Thank you for Friday's session. The feedback was direct and useful, exactly what we needed.

Below is a summary of what we heard, our revised priorities, and the actions we're taking.

**What We Heard**

The message was clear: we're company-building, not research-building. Three things need to happen before investors engage or operators sign:

1. IP must be secured. Without it, there's no asset to protect an investment.
2. A paid commercial pilot must be in place. This validates the technology and shifts risk profile significantly.
3. Materials must be investor and operator ready. Benefits-focused, quantifiable, and simple enough for a CEO with no tailings background.

We also heard the warning on CNRL - don't put all eggs in one basket, get everything in writing, and assume nothing until money is in hand.

**Revised Priorities**

Based on your input, we've reordered our objectives:

**1. Secure IP from Athabasca University**  
We're accelerating discussions with AU. They've been cooperative, but we're now applying business urgency to their timeline. Our target is to have an exclusive worldwide license or assignment agreement in place Q1 2025. We'll keep you updated on progress.

**2. Secure a Paid Commercial Pilot**  
This is where your networks become critical. Once we have pitch materials ready (target: next two weeks), we'll come back with a specific ask for introductions at CNRL, Suncor, and Imperial. We're not asking you to carry our message without ammunition.

**3. Raise Capital**  
With IP secured and a pilot in motion, we'll be positioned to have serious investor conversations. Dave, we'll take you up on the offer to work through financials and pro forma before we go out.

**How We'll Communicate**

Given the size of the group and everyone's bandwidth:

- Group updates via email on major progress (bi-weekly or as milestones hit)
- Individual or small-group conversations as needed, we'll reach out based on topic and availability
    
- Text for quick questions where you've indicated that works

We won't clog your inboxes or Slack. When we reach out, it'll be specific and actionable.

---

**What We Need From You (Not Yet, But Soon)**

Once pitch materials are ready:

- Introductions to operations-level contacts at target companies
- Review of pilot agreement language before we present it
- Guidance on investor timing and sequencing

We'll come back with specific asks once we've done the homework.

Thanks again for the candor. We're moving.

Jeff
