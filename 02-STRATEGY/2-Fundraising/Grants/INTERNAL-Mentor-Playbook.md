### Option 1: Executive Approach (Strategy Focus)
*Best for: VPs, Directors, Strategic Contacts (e.g., Pathways, Suncor, CNRL)*

**Subject:** Info: Optimizing water management decisions (cutting the 8-week lag)

Hi [Name],

I came across a company called Luminous BioSolutions that I thought might be relevant to your work on [Program/Strategy].

They seem to have solved the 8-week toxicity data lag that forces the industry to operate with large safety buffers. Their biosensor cuts the feedback loop to 48 hours, which allows for real-time process control rather than waiting for lab reports.

They've validated the tech at Imperial Kearl (finding significant efficiencies in flow optimization and season extension), and I understand they have some grant matching (Alberta Innovates/ERA) available for pilots to help operators build their 2027 regulatory baseline.

It looks like a credible way to de-risk the release strategy. If you're interested, I can introduce you to their COO, Jeff Violo, to handle the vetting.

Best,
[Your Name]

### Option 2: Operations Approach (Process Focus)
*Best for: Managers, Engineers, Site Leads*

**Subject:** Info: Real-time process control for water management

Hi [Name],

I know the 8-week lag on NAFC toxicity results is a constant friction point for process control.

I met a team (Luminous BioSolutions) who have validated a 48-hour biosensor at Kearl. It effectively gives you a "fuel gauge" for the wetland/treatment system instead of flying blind between lab reports.

It seems like a low-friction way to get better data. Offsite lab model, no IT integration or site access needed. They also mentioned they have ERA grant matching for pilots to help build the 2027 regulatory baseline.

Might be worth a look to see if it saves you some "safety factor" headaches. Let me know if you want an intro.

Best,
[Your Name]

### Option 3: LinkedIn DM (Short & Fast)
*Best for: Quick intros*

Hi [Name],

Ran across a team (Luminous BioSolutions) that validated a 48-hour NAFC biosensor at Imperial Kearl. Solves that 8-week data lag we always deal with.

They have some ERA funding for pilots. Zero IT integration/offsite lab model, so low friction to try.

Worth a conversation for your 2027 baseline?

## 🗣️ Verbal Pitches (For Meetings/Calls)

**The "Hybrid" Pitch (Best All-Rounder)**
> "Oil sands operators are managing billion-dollar water release strategies with an 8-week blind spot in toxicity data. Luminous provides a real-time fuel gauge for Naphthenic Acids, updating every 48 hours instead of 48 days. They validated $260K/year in efficiencies at the Imperial Kearl wetland project, and they're offering funded pilots (50% ERA match) for operators building their 2027 release baseline now."

**The "One-Liner" (Cocktail Party)**
> "Luminous provides a 'fuel gauge' for Naphthenic Acid toxicity, 48-hour feedback instead of the standard 8-week lag. They validated this at Imperial Kearl with $260K/year in savings."

## ❓ FAQ (If They Ask)

**Q: "How is this different from standard lab testing?"**
A: Standard testing takes 8 weeks. Luminous takes 48 hours. It's the difference between a monthly bank statement and a real-time ticker. It allows you to steer the process, not just report on it.

**Q: "Do you install hardware on our site?"**
A: No. Offsite lab model for pilots. You ship samples, we provide data. Zero IT friction.

**Q: "Why start now vs. 2027?"**
A: You need 12-18 months of baseline data for release authorization. Starting now guarantees you are "Regulatory Ready" when the window opens.
