# 24-Month Budget Strategy: The Strategic Buffer

Version: 3.1 (The "Velocity" Update)
Date: November 21, 2025
Status: DRAFT - Mentor Review Ready

## 1. Executive Summary
Fundraising Target: $2.5M CAD
Runway: 24 Months (Q1 2026 - Q4 2027)
Burn Strategy: Velocity First (Offsite Lab Model)

We have selected the **$2.5M Target** (vs. $2.0M) to fund our **Zero Friction Velocity Strategy**. This capital allows us to stand up the **Offsite Lab**, enabling us to process customer pilots *immediately* without waiting for 6-month site access approvals or grant matching cycles.

## 2. The "Use of Funds" Allocation
We prioritize Commercial Velocity over R&D.

### A. Total Raise: $2.5M
- **Less Founder Settlement:** ($82.5k)
- **Net Available Capital:** **$2,417,500**

### B. Allocation Breakdown
1. **Commercial Operations (70%):**
    - **The Offsite Lab:** Staffing and equipment for the Calgary facility.
    - **Sales & Success:** Managing the CNRL/Suncor pilot relationships.
    - **Field Logistics:** Sample shipping and handling infrastructure.
2. **Product Infrastructure (20%):**
    - **Relational Context Engine:** Hardening the "Trust Layer" (Audit trails).
    - **Biosensor Supply Chain:** Ruggedization for scale.
3. **Operations & IP (10%):**
    - Patent defense and legal.

## 3. The Strategic Buffer Defence
Investors will ask: "Why $2.5M? Why not lean out at $1.5M?"
The Answer: **We are buying Speed.**

| Risk Factor | The $1.5M Scenario (Lean) | The $2.5M Scenario (Velocity) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Site Access** | We wait 6+ months for site security clearance. | **We start Day 1** via Offsite Lab (Capital Funded). |
| **Grant Delays** | If ERA delays, we pause pilots. | **We float the pilots.** Speed is maintained. |
| **Data Moat** | We build the platform slowly. | **We capture the baseline** before competitors wake up. |
| **Runway End** | 18 Months (Desperation Raise). | **24 Months + Buffer** (Series A from strength). |

**Conclusion:** The extra $1M isn't for padding; it's for bypassing the biggest friction point in the industry (Site Access).

## 4. Pilot Economics: The Leveraged Model
- **Standard Model:** 50% Operator / 50% ERA Match.
- **The "Velocity" Model (Funded by Raise):** If grants delay, Luminous funds the lab cost directly to secure the data. The *Data Asset* is worth more than the cash burn.

## 5. The SaaS Transition (Headcount Evolution)
**Year 1 (Service):** High allocation to Lab Techs (Manual Processing).
**Year 2 (Software):** High allocation to Data Engineers (Automated Correlation).
*Note:* The "Offsite Lab" scales linearly; the "Context Engine" scales exponentially.

## 6. Mentor Validation Checklist (Nov 27)
- [ ] **The Velocity Argument:** Does the "Offsite Lab" strategy effectively counter the "Long Sales Cycle" objection?
- [ ] **Valuation:** Is $10M Pre-Money defensible given the "Infrastructure Play"?
