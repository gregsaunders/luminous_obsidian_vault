SUBJECT: Intro: Optimizing water management decisions (cutting the 8-week lag)

Hi [Name],

I wanted to introduce you to Jeff Violo at Luminous BioSolutions. Their company solves the 8-week toxicity data lag have operators running expensive "safety factor" operations for their tailings management.

Their innovative biosensor technology cuts NAFC testing lag from 8 weeks to 48 hours, creating a real-time feedback loop. They analyzed the Imperial Kearl wetland pilot and validated an minim$260K/year in operational efficiencies (flow optimization, extended seasons) with a 5-month payback.

Jeff is offering funded pilot programs (50% Alberta Innovates/ERA grant matching) for operators who need to build their 2027 release baseline now. Given [Company]'s focus on water management, I thought this might be timely.

Are you open to me connecting you two?

Best,

### Option 2: Operations (Process Focus)
*Best for: Managers, Engineers, Site Leads.*

SUBJECT: Intro: Real-time process control for water management

Hi [Name],

I wanted to introduce you to Jeff Violo at Luminous BioSolutions. They've developed a biosensor that cuts NAFC toxicity testing from 8 weeks to 48 hours. It acts as a real-time feedback loop for wetland treatment instead of a monthly lab report.

They analyzed publicly reported data from Imperial Kearl and calculated $260K/year in efficiencies: extended operating seasons, flow optimization, and automated reporting. That's the conservative floor—they believe discovery value (chemical optimization, fresh water substitution) is 3-5X that baseline.

Crucially: Zero IT integration. Offsite lab model with secure file transfer. No firewall exceptions, no site access required. You ship samples, they deliver insights.

Jeff is offering cost-recovery pilots (50% ERA grant matching) to help operators build their 2027 regulatory baseline. Given your work on tailings management, thought you should connect.

Are you open to me connecting you two?

Best,

Hi [Name],

Quick intro: Jeff Violo at Luminous BioSolutions just validated $260K/year in efficiencies at Imperial Kearl by cutting NAFC testing lag from 8 weeks to 48 hours.

They're offering grant-funded pilots (50% ERA match) for operators building 2027 release baselines. Zero IT integration—offsite lab model.

Worth a conversation? Happy to connect you two.
