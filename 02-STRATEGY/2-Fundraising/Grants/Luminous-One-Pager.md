# Operational Intelligence for Water Release
**Solving the 8-Week Toxicity Data Lag**

---
### The Problem: Operating in the Dark
Oil sands operators are managing billion-dollar water release strategies with an **8-week blind spot**.
*   **The Lag:** Standard NAFC toxicity testing takes 6-10 weeks.
*   **The Risk:** You are making daily treatment decisions based on data from two months ago.
*   **The Cost:** Expensive "safety factors," conservative chemical dosing, and delayed release authorization.

### The Solution: A Real-Time "Fuel Gauge"
Luminous BioSolutions provides the infrastructure to monitor toxicity at operational speed.
1.  **3-Panel Biosensor:** Cuts feedback time from **8 weeks to 48 hours**.
2.  **Relational Context Engine:** Automatically correlates toxicity spikes with your SCADA (Flow, Temp) and Weather data.

### Validated Value: $260,000/Year (Conservative Baseline)
We analyzed publicly reported pilot data from **Imperial Kearl** and calculated the efficiencies enabled by high-frequency monitoring:

| Efficiency | Annual Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Extended Season** | **$104,000** (Run 3 weeks longer via exact temp correlation) |
| **Flow Optimization** | **$78,000** (Route flow to highest-performing cells) |
| **Toxicity Proxy** | **$36,000** (Replace expensive Microtox testing) |
| **Refill Recovery** | **$14,000** (Reduce buffer days by 50%) |
| **Auto-Reporting** | **$28,000** (Automated compliance audit trails) |

**The Upside:** This $260K is the *floor*. The discovery value (chemical optimization, fresh water substitution, capital de-risking) is estimated at **3-5X this baseline**.

### The Offer: Funded Pilot Program (Q2 2026)
We are selecting 2 operators for our 2026 Commercial Pilot Program to build their **2027 Regulatory Baseline**.

*   **Investment:** Cost Recovery Only (Zero Profit Margin).
* Cost's shared across 2 operators, splits costs 
*   **Funding:** **50% Grant Matching** available via Alberta Innovates or ERA.
*   **Deployment:** **Zero IT Integration.** Offsite lab model (you ship samples, we deliver insights). No site access or OT network connectivity required.

### Why Start Now?
Alberta wants to double Oil production, has committed to release standards within 12-18 months, and has formed the OSMWSC with specific recommendations we address. **9-12 months of baseline toxicity data** goes a long way to release authorization. Starting in Q2 2026 gives you the head start to "Regulatory Ready" when the window opens.
