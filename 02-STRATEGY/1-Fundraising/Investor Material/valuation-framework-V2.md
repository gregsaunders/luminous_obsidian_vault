# Valuation Framework: Luminous BioSolutions (Pre-Seed)

Status: Strategic Draft for Mentor Review
Target Raise: $2.5M CAD (The "Strategic Buffer" Scenario)
Valuation Target: $8M - $10M Pre-Money

## 1. The Core Thesis: Why We Command a Premium

Most pre-seed startups ask investors to fund R&D Risk ("Will it work?").
Luminous is asking investors to fund the **Critical Infrastructure** for a massive industry transition.

We justify a premium valuation based on three defensible pillars:

### Pillar A: Extreme Capital Efficiency (The "Operator" Premium)
- **Typical CleanTech:** Burns $3M-$5M to reach TRL 7.
- **Luminous Achievement:** Reached **TRL 8** (Multi-season field validation) on **<$150k** of hard capital.
- **The Signal:** We are elite operators. We don't burn cash; we convert it into assets.

### Pillar B: The Trust Infrastructure (The "Moat" Premium)
- **The Problem:** Operators face an existential "Trust Deficit" with Regulators and Indigenous groups.
- **The Solution:** Luminous provides the "Glass Box"—an immutable digital chain of custody for water quality data.
- **The Value:** This is not a tool; it is the **License to Operate**. The switching costs for a regulatory audit trail are massive.

### Pillar C: Validated Unit Economics (The "Business" Premium)
- **Proven ROI:** $260k/year validated operational savings (Kearl data).
- **Payback Period:** 5.0 months.
- **Pricing Power:** We are selling "Release Readiness," not just sensors.

## 2. Investment to Date (The Foundation)
We successfully bootstrapped to Field Validation.

| Asset | Status | Value Driver |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Biosensor Tech** | **TRL 8 (Field Validated)** | 3-Panel System validated at Imperial Kearl. High correlation with HRMS. |
| **Relational Context Engine** | **Deployed (MVP)** | Automated correlation of Bio + SCADA + PDF data operational. |
| **Customer Traction** | **Advanced Pipeline** | Imperial Kearl (Completed Pilot). CNRL Albian (Q2 2026 Planned). |
| **Founder Equity** | **Full Commitment** | Founders have invested 18 months of effort to de-risk the tech. |

## 3. Valuation Benchmarks & Scenarios
Positioning Luminous as a "Late-Seed" asset in a "Pre-Seed" round.

**The Narrative: "The Infrastructure Play"**
- **Valuation Range:** $8M - $10M Pre-Money.
- **Dilution:** ~20-25% for $2.5M.
- **Why:** Investors are funding the deployment of a **Data Monopoly** in the oil sands.

## 4. Use of Funds: Market Expansion (Not R&D)
Total Raise: $2.5M CAD
Goal: 24-Month Runway (Strategic Buffer against Grant Delays).

- **70% Market Expansion ($1.7M):** Deploy 3-4 Pilots via **"Offsite Lab"** model (Zero Friction). Bypass site access delays.
- **20% Product Hardening ($500k):** Ruggedize Biosensor supply chain. Enhance Platform security (Air Gap).
- **10% Operations ($300k):** Legal, IP protection, Working Capital.

## 5. Cap Table Strategy (Clean & Founder-Friendly)
**Current Structure:**
- Founders: ~90% Ownership.
- Debt: ~$40k (Expenses).

**Proposed Deal Structure:**
- **Convertible Note for Expenses:** Convert debt into equity.
- **Founder Vesting:** Standard 4-year vesting with 1-year cliff.
- **Option Pool:** 10% post-money.

**Post-Money Ownership Target:**
- Founders: ~60-65%
- Investors: ~20-25%
- Option Pool: ~10%

## 6. Mentor Validation Questions (Nov 27)
- **Valuation Check:** Does the "Trust Infrastructure" narrative justify the $10M cap?
- **The Buffer:** Is the "Offsite Lab" strategy (using the $2.5M to bypass site access) a strong selling point for velocity?
