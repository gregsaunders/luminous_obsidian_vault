# Directive 085: Fluid Tailings Management for Oil Sands Mining Projects

**Issuer:** [[Alberta Energy Regulator]] (AER)
**Effective Date:** May 19, 2022
**Replaces:** Previous edition (October 12, 2017) and [[Directive 074]]
**Context:** Aligns with the [[Lower Athabasca Regional Plan]] (LARP) and the [[Tailings Management Framework]] (TMF).

---

## 1. Overview and Objectives
[[Directive 085]] establishes the requirements for managing [[Fluid Tailings]] volumes for oil sands mining projects. It shifts from uniform requirements to an **outcome- and risk-based approach**, holding operators accountable for project-specific plans that align with the [[Tailings Management Framework]] (TMF).

### Key Objectives
* **Minimize Accumulation:** Ensure fluid tailings are treated and reclaimed progressively during the life of a project.
* **End of Mine Life Target:** All fluid tailings associated with a project must be [[Ready to Reclaim]] (RTR) **ten years after the end of mine life**.
* **Liability Management:** Decrease liability and environmental risk resulting from the accumulation of fluid tailings on the landscape.

---

## 2. Fluid Tailings Profiles and Thresholds
The AER manages performance through the approval of **Fluid Tailings Volume Profiles**. These profiles forecast the accumulation and reduction of tailings over time.

### The Profiles
Operators must define profiles for two distinct inventories:
1.  **[[New Fluid Tailings]]:** Tailings created on or after January 1, 2015.
2.  **[[Legacy Tailings]]:** Fluid tailings in storage before January 1, 2015.

### Thresholds and Triggers
To ensure compliance, the AER sets project-specific thresholds based on the volume profiles:
* **[[Profile Deviation Trigger]]:** Alerts when the volume of fluid tailings is growing faster than approved.
* **[[Total Volume Trigger]]:** A warning signal indicating the volume has exceeded the approved maximum accumulation.
* **[[Total Volume Limit]]:** A hard limit. Exceedance indicates an unacceptable risk to the environment and potential long-term liability, compromising the ability to meet the [[End of Mine Life]] target.

---

## 3. Ready to Reclaim (RTR) Status
Fluid tailings are removed from the official inventory only when they achieve **[[Ready to Reclaim]] (RTR)** status. 

**Definition:** Fluid tailings are RTR when they have been:
1.  Processed with an accepted technology.
2.  Placed in their final landscape position.
3.  Meet specific **performance criteria**.

### RTR Subobjectives
To track performance during the operational stage, deposits must meet two subobjectives:
* **Subobjective 1 (Physical Properties):** The deposit is on a trajectory to support future stages of activity (e.g., capping, trafficability).
* **Subobjective 2 (Environmental Effects):** The deposit is managed to minimize effects on the surrounding environment (e.g., seepage, stability) and will not compromise the ability to reclaim to a self-sustaining ecosystem.

> **Note:** [[Ready to Reclaim]] (operational status) is distinct from **Ready for Reclamation** (land status available for reclamation activities).

---

## 4. Application Requirements
Operators must submit applications under the [[Oil Sands Conservation Act]] (OSCA) to amend existing approvals.

### Key Application Components
* **Volume Profiles:** Graphical and tabular forecasts for New and Legacy fluid tailings.
* **Treatment Technologies:** Justification of best available technologies, including process flow diagrams and contingencies for technology failure.
* **Map of Deposits:** Locations of all fluid tailings ponds and treated deposits (existing and proposed).
* **Water Management:** Explanation of capacity to hold water and tailings within the on-site closed-circuit system.
* **Environmental Assessment:** Description of risks and trade-offs (air, land, water) associated with the chosen management plan.

### Specific Circumstances
* **[[Water-Capped Fluid Tailings]]:** Currently, this technology cannot be used to remove volumes from inventory pending further government direction. If proposed, an alternative technology option must be provided as a backup.
* **Temporary Locations:** Tailings treated and placed temporarily (e.g., thin-lift drying) must have specific RTR criteria for both the interim and final locations.

---

## 5. Reporting Requirements
Operators must submit an **Annual Fluid Tailings Management Report** by **April 30** of each year, covering the previous calendar year.

### Report Content
* **Volume Accounting:** Summary of annual fluid tailings volumes (New and Legacy).
* **Performance vs. Profile:** Comparison of actual volumes against the approved profile and thresholds.
* **Management Level:** Identification of the current TMF management level (Level 1 to 4).
* **Deposit Status:** Data confirming if treated deposits are meeting [[RTR Performance Criteria]].
* **Water Balance:** Site-wide water balance and inventory of water in tailings.
* **Mitigation Actions:** Details on any contingency plans activated due to underperformance.

**Transparency:** These reports are made publicly available by the AER.

---

## 6. Compliance and Enforcement
Performance is categorized into four **[[Management Levels]]** based on the TMF:

| Level | Description | Potential AER Actions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Level 1** | On track with approved profile. | Routine verification and surveillance. |
| **Level 2** | Exceeds [[Profile Deviation Trigger]]. | Requirement for a recovery plan; financial tools (MFSP) may be applied. |
| **Level 3** | Exceeds [[Total Volume Trigger]]. | Action plan required; potential penalties or compliance levies. |
| **Level 4** | Exceeds [[Total Volume Limit]]. | Most severe responses: production curtailment, suspension of approvals, maximum financial penalties. |

## 7. Measurement Guidelines (COSIA)
*Reference: Appendix 4 - COSIA's Guidelines for Determining Oil Sands Fluid Tailings Volumes*

To ensure consistency, volume is measured using standard techniques defined by [[COSIA]].

### Defining the "Fluid Tailings" Layer
The volume is the material between the **Mudline** (top) and the **Hard Bottom** (bottom).

#### 1. Measuring the [[Mudline]] (Top)
* *Definition:* The transition from clear water to fluid tailings (typically ~5% solids).
* **Water-Covered Deposits:**
    * **[[Sonar Survey]]:** Continuous depth recording using high-frequency sound (~200 kHz).
    * **[[Density Plate]]:** A calibrated plate (neutral buoyancy at ~1.032 sg) lowered until it settles on the fines interface.
    * **Validation:** Must be validated using **Interval Sampling** (sampling at 10cm intervals to find the 5% solids depth).
* **Sub-Aerial Deposits:**
    * **[[LiDAR]]** or standard land survey techniques.

#### 2. Measuring the [[Hard Bottom]] (Bottom)
* *Definition:* The transition from fluid to solid (undrained shear strength > 5 kPa).
* **[[Drop Sounding]]:** A standardized weighted tool (approx. 300 lbs) dropped to the point of refusal.
* **[[Cone Penetration Testing]] (CPT):** Used to validate drop soundings or in areas with debris/bitumen mats. Bottom is defined where net tip resistance ($q_{net}$) exceeds a calibrated value (typically >75 kPa for cone).

## 8. Key Definitions

* **[[Fluid Tailings]]:** Any fluid discard from bitumen extraction containing >5 mass % suspended solids and having <5 kPa undrained shear strength.
* **[[Fines]]:** Solids with particle sizes equal to or less than 44 micrometres.
* **[[End of Mine Life]]:** The year mining of bitumen is complete per the approved mine plan.
* **[[Legacy Equivalent Volume]]:** Volume equivalent to fluid tailings in storage before Jan 1, 2015.
