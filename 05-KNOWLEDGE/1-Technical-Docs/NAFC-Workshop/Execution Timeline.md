### Part 4: Execution Timeline

**Phase 1: The Evidence (Weeks 1-3)**

- **Action:** Dr. Lewenza runs the Humic/Fulvic specificity protocols and the "Matrix Inhibition" tests.
    
- **Action:** You compile the "Antigravity" context file.
    
- **Deliverable:** Raw data graphs proving specificity and robustness.
    

**Phase 2: The Asset Build (Weeks 4-6)**

- **Action:** Generate diagrams using "Nano Banana" based on real data from Phase 1.
    
- **Action:** Draft the "Context-Aware Monitoring" White Paper (Version 2.0). This version explicitly attacks the FTIR false-positive problem using the new data.
    
- **Deliverable:** A polished, "cynical scientist-proof" white paper and presentation deck.
    

**Phase 3: The "Soft Launch" / Peer Review (Week 7)**

- **Action:** Send the White Paper _privately_ to 2-3 key, friendly participants from the July workshop (e.g., someone from InnoTech or NAIT ).
    
- **Script:** "We’ve generated some data regarding humic interference that contradicts the prevailing assumptions about biosensors. Before we publish, I’d value your cynical take on this."
    
- **Goal:** Get them to validate your science _before_ you present to the wider group.
    

**Phase 4: The Pivot Pitch (Week 9+)**

- **Action:** Present to the wider group or specific operators (Imperial/Suncor).
    
- **The Pitch:** "Stop spending money treating humics. Use Luminous to find the real toxicity."
