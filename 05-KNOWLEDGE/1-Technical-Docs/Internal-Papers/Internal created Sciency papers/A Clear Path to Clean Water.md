# Executive Summary: Specificity Matters A Clear Path to Clean Water

## The Shared Goal

The ultimate objective for all stakeholders—Indigenous and local communities, regulators, government, and oil sands operators—is to successfully remediate Oil Sands Process-Affected Water (OSPW) to the point where it is verifiably safe for release into the Athabasca River. Achieving this goal depends entirely on our ability to monitor the water with confidence. We need a monitoring system that is accurate, fast, cost-effective, and practical enough for frequent use across many different locations. This will allow us to track the success of cleanup efforts in near real-time.

## The Core Challenge: A Case of Mistaken Identity

The central difficulty in monitoring OSPW is distinguishing the harmful, toxic compounds from the oil sands process, known as **Naphthenic Acid Fraction Compounds (NAFCs)**, from harmless, naturally occurring organic matter like **Humic and Fulvic acids** that are found throughout the region. Think of it this way: NAFCs are the "bad actors" we need to remove, and Humic and Fulvic acids are innocent "look-alikes". If our testing methods can't tell them apart, we risk getting a false positive, which means we would believe the water is more contaminated than it is, or a false negative, which means we would miss contamination that is actually there. This uncertainty undermines the entire remediation effort.

## Evaluating the Tools: A Comparative Analysis

We have analyzed three key technologies for monitoring NAFCs, each with distinct advantages and disadvantages.

## The Solution: A Smart, Multi-Tiered Monitoring Strategy

No single tool can meet all of our needs. Relying only on the fastest method, FTIR, sacrifices accuracy. Relying only on the most accurate method, HRMS, is too slow and expensive for the frequent, widespread monitoring required to manage remediation effectively.

The most effective path forward is a multi-tiered strategy that uses the right tool at the right time.

### Tier 1: The Wide Net (Screening)

The tool for this tier is 

**FTIR Spectroscopy**. Its purpose is to conduct broad, rapid, and low-cost surveillance across all monitoring points. Its job is to quickly identify any areas with a high total acid level, acting as an early warning system. Samples that pass this initial screen may not need further testing, saving time and money.

### Tier 2: The Smart Filter (Specific Assessment)

For any samples flagged in Tier 1, the tool to use is the 

**NA Biosensor**. Its job is to provide a fast and specific answer to the most important question: "Is this high acid reading actually due to toxic NAFCs?". It can also tell remediation teams what kind of NAFCs they are dealing with, which helps to guide and optimize the cleanup process in near real-time.

### Tier 3: The Final Verdict (Confirmation & Compliance)

For the most critical decisions, 

**High-Resolution Mass Spectrometry (HRMS)** is the indispensable tool. Its job is to provide the final, indisputable confirmation that the water has been successfully remediated and meets all safety guidelines for release. This is the data that will be used for regulatory reporting and to provide ultimate confidence to all stakeholders.

By adopting this strategic, tiered approach, we can create a monitoring program that is both scientifically robust and operationally practical. This enables the frequent and high-confidence data collection necessary to successfully manage the remediation of OSPW and ensure the protection of the surrounding environment.
