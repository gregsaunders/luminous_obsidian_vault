# 1. Regulatory and Operational Context

Oil sands tailings management presents a unique financial and regulatory challenge because the largest economic obligations associated with tailings do not arise from present-day operating requirements, but from long-duration closure, reclamation, and post-closure monitoring obligations that extend decades into the future. Alberta’s regulatory framework for oil sands tailings does not currently mandate that tailings water be treated to discharge-quality standards or released into the environment. Instead, tailings are managed under the Alberta Energy Regulator’s Fluid Tailings Management regulation, principally Directive 085: Fluid Tailings Management for Oil Sands Mining Projects, which governs how operators must plan, report, and manage fluid tailings volumes under the Oil Sands Conservation Act but does not set tailings water discharge criteria. Operators must prepare and update Tailings Management Plans and submit annual tailings management reports, yet these requirements focus on containment profiles and long-term management rather than active discharge to surface waters. At present, operators are required to contain process-affected water from oil sands mining in engineered tailings ponds, and release of process-affected water to the environment is currently prohibited under Alberta’s tailings management regime and related Water Act requirements. However, in recognition of the long-term challenge of managing oil sands mine water, the Government of Alberta established an Oil Sands Mine Water Steering Committee in 2024 to assess options for safely managing water in tailings ponds and to develop recommendations for future actions, including the eventual establishment of technical discharge standards. Despite the absence of specific discharge requirements, oil sands operators are subject to binding legal and regulatory obligations to permanently stabilize tailings facilities, decommission mining infrastructure, and restore disturbed lands to an equivalent land capability. These obligations are imposed through project approvals and environmental legislation administered by the Alberta Energy Regulator and remain in force until reclamation certification is achieved. There is no automatic release from liability based on the passage of time, nor is compliance satisfied by indefinite containment alone. This creates a structural mismatch between how tailings are managed operationally in the present and how they are treated economically and legally over their full life cycle. Tailings-related costs are largely deferred, uncertain in timing, and sensitive to assumptions about future remediation methods, monitoring duration, and closure performance. As a result, tailings liabilities are not meaningfully captured in current operating costs, near-term capital expenditures, or standard industry cost curves. Instead, the economic consequences of tailings management are primarily reflected in long-dated environmental liabilities recognized on corporate balance sheets. These liabilities represent the discounted present value of future obligations that operators are legally required to satisfy, even though the precise technical pathway to closure has not yet been finalized. Understanding this distinction is critical for evaluating the potential economic relevance of new tailings-related technologies. Because current operations do not involve discharge and because future closure requirements remain uncertain, the value of such technologies cannot be assessed by reference to existing treatment costs or testing practices. Any meaningful financial evaluation must therefore focus on how improved information, monitoring, or risk management could alter the duration, uncertainty, or cost structure of obligations that already exist under current law.

# 2. Balance-Sheet Recognition of Tailings Related Liabilities

Although oil sands tailings water is not currently subject to discharge requirements, the long-term obligations associated with tailings management are already recognized and quantified by operators under existing accounting and regulatory frameworks. This section examines how major oil sands producers translate legally enforceable closure, reclamation, and post-closure monitoring obligations into financial liabilities on their balance sheets. By reviewing asset retirement obligation and decommissioning disclosures across the largest operators, this section establishes the scale, duration, and assumption-driven nature of tailings-related liabilities as they are measured today, providing the financial foundation for evaluating how changes in uncertainty, timing, or monitoring requirements could affect their economic profile.

## 2.1. Legal and Accounting Basis for Recognition of Tailings-Related Liabilities

Under applicable accounting standards, oil sands operators are required to recognize environmental and closure-related liabilities once a present legal obligation exists, future cash outflows are probable, and the associated costs can be reasonably estimated. Importantly, the requirement to recognize such liabilities does not depend on the existence of a finalized technical pathway for closure or a current regulatory requirement to discharge tailings water. Rather, recognition is triggered by the existence of legally enforceable obligations arising from enacted laws, regulatory approvals, and binding conditions associated with resource development. In the context of oil sands mining, these obligations arise from project-specific approvals and environmental legislation administered by the Alberta Energy Regulator, which impose requirements to decommission mining infrastructure, manage tailings risks over the long term, and restore disturbed land to an equivalent land capability. Operators remain legally responsible for tailings facilities until reclamation certification is achieved, with no automatic release from liability based on the passage of time or indefinite containment. These obligations therefore constitute a present legal obligation under accounting standards, even though the precise timing and technical methods of closure remain uncertain. CNRL This principle is reflected consistently in corporate financial disclosures across major Canadian oil sands operators. Canadian Natural Resources Limited (CNRL) explicitly states that it: “is required to recognize a liability for ARO associated with its property, plant and equipment, including property, plant and equipment for which underlying reserves have been de-booked, and the carrying value of the asset has been fully depleted.” CNRL further clarifies that an ARO is recognized to the extent of a legal obligation resulting from existing or enacted laws, statutes, ordinances, contracts, or by legal construction, confirming that recognition is driven by current legal obligations rather than future regulatory developments or voluntary closure strategies. Suncor Suncor Energy Inc. applies the same recognition logic, disclosing that “Decommissioning and restoration provisions are associated with the retirement of Property, Plant and Equity and Exploration and Evaluation assets. The total undiscounted and uninflated amount of estimated future cash flows required to settle the obligation December 31, 2024 was approximately $21.5 billion.” Suncor measures these obligations at the present value of management’s best estimate of future cash flows required to settle the obligation, emphasizing that uncertainty regarding future regulatory requirements, reclamation methods, or timing affects the measurement and periodic re-estimation of the liability, not its initial recognition. While both Suncor and CNRL recognize asset retirement obligations based on existing legal requirements, Suncor’s disclosures place greater emphasis on uncertainty as a driver of liability measurement and re-estimation, whereas CNRL’s disclosures emphasize the certainty of obligation and scope, with uncertainty embedded implicitly within long-dated cost assumptions. In both cases, improved information has the potential to influence the estimated cost and timing of tailings-related liabilities without altering their legal existence. Imperial Oil Imperial Oil Limited similarly recognizes asset retirement obligations when a legal obligation exists and records those obligations on a discounted basis using assumptions about timing, settlement costs, discount rates, and inflation. Unlike Suncor and CNRL, Imperial: “accrues environmental liabilities when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Provisions for environmental liabilities are determined based on engineering estimated costs, taking into account the anticipated method and extent of remediation consistent with legal requirements, current technology and the possible use of location” Of which includes relevant compliance costs due to “[c]hanges in environmental legislation (including, but not limited to application of regulations related to … mine tailings …” Cenovus Cenovus Energy Inc. follows the same framework, recognizing decommissioning liabilities when a present legal or constructive obligation arises from past events and discounting expected future cash flows using a credit-adjusted risk-free rate. Cenovus explicitly acknowledges that many of these obligations will not be settled for decades, underscoring that long time horizons and technical uncertainty are intrinsic features of such liabilities rather than barriers to recognition. Relevance Across all four operators, the accounting conclusion is consistent and unambiguous: oil sands tailings-related obligations must be recognized once the legal obligation to ultimately retire, reclaim, and restore affected assets exists. Uncertainty regarding the ultimate closure pathway, monitoring duration, or whether tailings water will eventually be treated or discharged does not defer recognition; instead, it is incorporated into the estimation, discounting, and periodic re-measurement of the liability over time. This distinction is critical for financial analysis. Asset retirement and decommissioning liabilities represent unavoidable economic burdens that are already embedded in corporate balance sheets under current law. While their reported values are sensitive to assumptions about timing, discount rates, and future costs, their existence is not contingent on future regulatory tightening or the adoption of specific tailings treatment technologies. Any evaluation of technologies that could reduce uncertainty, shorten closure timelines, or improve confidence in long-term performance must therefore begin with an understanding of how these obligations are already recognized today; and how they are subsequently measured.

## 2.2. Measurement of Environmental Liabilities: Discounting, Timing, and Assumptions

While Section 2.1 establishes why tailings-related liabilities must be recognized under current law, this section examines how those liabilities are measured in practice. This distinction is critical. The economic relevance of tailings-related technologies does not arise from the existence of the obligation itself, but from the assumptions used to estimate its magnitude, timing, and present value. Across major Canadian oil sands operators, asset retirement and decommissioning liabilities are measured using discounted cash flow methodologies that rely heavily on long-dated assumptions regarding closure timing, remediation methods, monitoring duration, inflation, and discount rates. These assumptions materially influence the reported liability values and create an analytical entry point for evaluating how improved information, monitoring, or risk management could alter those estimates. Importantly, these assumption based mechanisms create sign

# 3. Economic Interpretation of Long-Dated Tailings Liabilities

Sections 1 and 2 establish two critical facts. First, oil sands tailings obligations are legally unavoidable and already recognized on corporate balance sheets. Second, the reported magnitude of these liabilities is not fixed, but highly sensitive to assumptions regarding timing, discount rates, monitoring duration, and remediation uncertainty. This section explains why small operational or informational improvements—such as those potentially enabled by Luminous’s biosensor technology—can have immediate and outsized financial relevance, even though the underlying obligations extend decades into the future. Across the four major oil sands operators, tailings-related liabilities are valued using discounted cash flow methodologies that rely on a small set of core assumptions: Discount rate (typically a credit-adjusted risk-free rate) Expected duration of closure and post-closure obligations (often 50–60+ years) Timing and profile of future cash outflows Degree of uncertainty embedded in monitoring, remediation, and closure assumptions Because these liabilities are discounted over very long horizons, modest changes in any of these inputs—particularly time and uncertainty—can materially change their present value today. This creates a clear analytical pathway for evaluating the potential economic contribution of technologies that improve information quality, monitoring efficiency, or risk management, even in the absence of regulatory change or near-term discharge requirements. The subsections that follow isolate three mechanisms through which value can be created: Changes in effective duration (time compression) Changes in uncertainty embedded in liability estimates Changes in discounting assumptions driven by perceived risk Each mechanism is evaluated using simplified, transparent financial modeling grounded in publicly disclosed data.

## 3.1. Time Compression Effects on Long-Dated Liabilities (CNRL)

Canadian Natural Resources Limited (CNRL) is the most suitable primary reference case for time-based modeling for three reasons. First, CNRL explicitly discloses an Asset Retirement Obligation for Oil Sands Mining and Upgrading as a distinct asset category. This is the only major operator that clearly confirms tailings are included within a specifically identified oil sands ARO balance, rather than embedded implicitly within broader upstream or corporate provisions. Second, CNRL provides unusually clear disclosure regarding the expected settlement horizon of its ARO, stating that obligations are expected to be settled over approximately 60 years. This explicit duration assumption is essential for time-based sensitivity analysis. Third, CNRL applies a disclosed credit-adjusted risk-free discount rate of approximately 4.8%, which is consistent with peers and allows direct comparison without introducing firm-specific capital structure effects. For clarity and conservatism, the quantitative illustrations below use CNRL as the base case.

### 3.1.1 Valuation Framework and Base Assumptions

All four operators implicitly rely on standard discounted cash flow mechanics when measuring asset retirement and decommissioning obligations. In simplified form, the present value of a long-dated liability can be expressed as: Where:

- PV = present value of the liability
- FV = undiscounted future cash flows
- r = discount rate
- n = time until settlement (years) The analysis does not attempt to re-engineer company models. Instead, it applies sensitivity analysis around disclosed assumptions. Base-case inputs (CNRL illustrative):
- Reported ARO (Oil Sands Mining & Upgrading): $1.9 billion
- Discount rate: 4.8%
- Settlement horizon: 60 years

### 3.1.2 Sensitivity to Changes in Duration (Years)

Holding all other assumptions constant, reducing the effective duration of the liability—through earlier stabilization, reduced long-term monitoring, or faster confidence accumulation—changes the present value today. This can be approximated as: Where, d is the reduction in effective duration.

||Sample Calculation:|
|---|---|
|These figures do not represent cost savings in the conventional operating sense. They represent changes in the present value of already-recognized, legally unavoidable liabilities resulting from earlier realization of obligations that already exist, not from incremental spending or new regulatory requirements.||

### 3.1.3 Sensitivity to Sub-Year Reduction (Monitoring Phase)

Importantly, not all duration effects operate at the scale of whole years. Monitoring, verification, and confidence-building phases often operate on monthly or quarterly timelines, even when final closure spans decades. Modeling fractional reductions using the same framework: Where, d < 1

|Effective Reduction|Implied PV Increase|
|---|---|
|3 mo.|~$23 million|
|6 mo.|~$46 million|
|9 mo.|~$69 million|
|12 mo.|~$91 million|
|This framing is particularly relevant for technologies focused on biological monitoring, early detection, or performance verification, where the primary benefit is reducing the time required to establish confidence rather than accelerating final reclamation certification.||
|The key insight is not the precision of any single estimate, but the scale mismatch between:||
|The cost of improving monitoring or information quality, and||
|The balance-sheet sensitivity of liabilities discounted over multi-decade horizons.||
|Even small reductions in effective duration—measured in months—can produce present-value impacts that are material relative to the order-of-magnitude cost of a paid pilot (tens of thousands of dollars). This asymmetry provides a financially coherent justification for evaluating tailings-focused technologies based on their potential to compress time and uncertainty, rather than on immediate operating cost reductions.||

## 3.2 Uncertainty Compression and Liability Re-Measurement

While Section 3.1 isolates the effect of time compression, an equally important, and often larger, driver of liability valuation is uncertainty embedded in long-dated closure and monitoring assumptions. Asset retirement and decommissioning liabilities are not point estimates. They are management estimates constructed under uncertainty regarding remediation scope, monitoring duration, biological performance, regulatory acceptance, and future intervention requirements. Under accounting standards, this uncertainty is not ignored; it is explicitly incorporated into liability measurement through conservative assumptions, contingency buffers, and periodic re-estimation. As a result, the reported present value of a tailings-related liability reflects not only expected future costs, but also risk-weighted uncertainty about whether those costs will increase, extend, or require rework over time.

### 3.2.1 How Uncertainty Enters ARO Measurement

Across major oil sands operators, uncertainty affects liability measurement through several mechanisms: Conservative assumptions about remediation scope and duration Extended monitoring horizons to demonstrate long-term stability Contingency allowances for potential future remediation actions Sensitivity to regulatory review, approval, or re-assessment of closure plans This is reflected explicitly in disclosures. Operators consistently emphasize that changes in estimated future costs, timing, technology, and regulatory interpretation can materially affect the recorded liability, even when the underlying legal obligation itself does not change. In practice, this means that the reported liability already includes a margin for uncertainty, particularly for assets such as tailings facilities that are characterized by long durations, biological complexity, and site-specific risk.

### 3.2.2 Why Information Quality Has Financial Value

Technologies that improve biological monitoring, early detection, and performance verification do not eliminate tailings obligations. However, they can reduce uncertainty surrounding: Whether tailings systems are stabilizing as expected Whether biological risks (e.g., naphthenic acid impacts) are trending favorably Whether additional remediation or extended monitoring will be required Whether closure assumptions remain defensible over time Improved information quality can therefore influence management’s best estimate of future cash flows, even if total closure is still decades away. Under accounting standards, when uncertainty is reduced, liabilities may be re-measured to reflect updated assumptions. This creates a financial pathway whereby better monitoring and risk visibility can lower the expected value of future obligations, not by changing the law, but by changing what is reasonably expected under that law.

### 3.2.3 Illustrative Sensitivity: Small Percentage Changes, Large Effects

Because tailings liabilities are large and long-dated, even very small changes in assumed future costs can materially affect present value. Using CNRL’s reported Oil Sands Mining & Upgrading ARO of approximately $1.9 billion as an illustrative base case for scenario analysis: | Reduction in Expected Future Cost | Approximate PV Impact | | --- | --- | | 0.10% | ~ $1.9 million | | 0.25% | ~ $4.8 million | | 0.50% | ~ $9.5 million | | 1.00% | ~ $19.0 million | These figures are not forecasts. They simply illustrate the order-of-magnitude sensitivity of long-dated liabilities to modest changes in expected outcomes. Crucially, these impacts arise without accelerating closure timelines and without assuming regulatory change. They result purely from narrowing uncertainty bands around already-recognized obligations. A tailings-focused biosensor is not a remediation technology; it is an information technology applied to a biological risk domain. Its economic relevance therefore lies in its ability to: Reduce uncertainty earlier in the life of the liability Improve confidence in biological performance trends Support more defensible closure and monitoring assumptions Reduce the likelihood of conservative re-estimation driven by information gaps From a financial perspective, this means the value of a pilot is not tied to immediate operating cost reductions. Instead, it is tied to whether improved information can collapse even a small portion of the uncertainty premium embedded in long-dated liabilities. Given the scale of tailings-related obligations, the asymmetry is clear: the cost of testing whether uncertainty can be reduced is small relative to the potential balance-sheet sensitivity such reductions create.

## 3.3. Discounting and Risk Perception Effects (Imperial Oil Reference Case)

While Sections 3.1 and 3.2 demonstrate how time compression and uncertainty reduction can affect the present value of long-dated tailings liabilities, a third mechanism operates through the discount rate applied to those liabilities. Discount rates reflect management’s assessment of timing, execution risk, and uncertainty associated with future remediation and closure activities. Because tailings obligations are discounted over horizons of 50–60+ years, even modest differences in discount rates produce large changes in reported liability values. Importantly, this mechanism does not create value in the sense of reducing the underlying obligation. Rather, it affects how conservatively that obligation is measured today. For liabilities, a higher discount rate results in a lower reported present value, and therefore a smaller balance-sheet burden.

### 3.3.1 Evidence Among Corporate Disclosures

Among major oil sands operators, disclosed discount rates vary meaningfully: CNRL, Suncor, and (to a large extent) Cenovus (5.2%) applies a credit-adjusted risk-free discount rate of approximately 4.8%, reflecting long-dated obligations with substantial uncertainty. Imperial Oil applies a materially higher discount rate of approximately 6.0%, explicitly grounding its ARO and environmental liability estimates in engineering-based cost assessments and technology-related assumptions. Imperial’s disclosures state that its asset retirement and environmental liabilities are estimated using assumptions related to: anticipated remediation methods, current and expected technology, engineering judgments regarding execution feasibility, and regulatory requirements as interpreted through available technical solutions. This is a critical distinction. Imperial’s use of a higher discount rate indicates a view that remediation activities are supported by greater technical determinacy or execution confidence, allowing future cash flows to be discounted more aggressively. In accounting terms, this reflects lower perceived risk in the timing and execution of remediation, not a weaker legal obligation.

### 3.3.2 Discount Sensitivity (CNRL Illustrative)

Using CNRL’s reported Oil Sands Mining & Upgrading ARO of approximately $1.9 billion as a base case, the sensitivity of the reported liability to changes in the discount rate is substantial:

|Change in Discount Rate (%)|Approximate Impact on PV|
|---|---|
|+ 0.25%|- $110 million|
|+ 0.50%|- $210 million|
|+ 1.00%|- $420 million|
|+ 1.20% (to 6%)|- $520 million|
|As highlighted, if CNRL were able to justify discounting its tailings-related liabilities at a rate comparable to Imperial’s 6.0%, the implied present value of its Oil Sands Mining & Upgrading ARO would fall by approximately $500 million, holding all other assumptions constant.||
|This reduction would not reflect a reduction in environmental responsibility, nor a deferral of legal obligations. It would reflect a reassessment of execution risk, technological confidence, and uncertainty surrounding future remediation activities.||

### 3.3.3 Relevance to Tailings Monitoring and Technology

Discount rates are not chosen arbitrarily. They are grounded in management’s judgment about the risk profile of future cash flows, including: uncertainty around remediation methods, likelihood of rework or extended monitoring, technological reliability, and confidence in closure performance. Technologies that improve biological monitoring, early detection, and system understanding do not change the law. However, they can influence how confidently future remediation pathways are understood and executed. Over time, this can support a reassessment of the risk embedded in long-dated tailings obligations. In this sense, discount rate sensitivity represents a measurement channel, not an independent value lever. A biosensor does not “earn” a higher discount rate on its own. But improved technical confidence, supported by better data and monitoring, can reduce perceived execution risk; one of the inputs that determines how aggressively liabilities are discounted. For tailings-related liabilities:

- Higher discount rates reduce reported present value
- Lower discount rates increase reported present value Accordingly, from a balance-sheet perspective, operators prefer lower reported liabilities, all else equal. The relevance of discount rate sensitivity in this analysis is not to suggest manipulation of assumptions, but to demonstrate how technology-driven reductions in uncertainty and execution risk can materially affect liability measurement under existing accounting frameworks.
